  Common Query types

  Keyword Queries:

  Such queries don't have semantic meaning, merely consist of keywords and the
  order of words does not matter:

  arya stark father
  jon snow country
  arya stark younger brothers

  Questions (Interrogative Queries):

  In such queries users ask a question in a complete, "natural" sentence.
  Regardless of the presence of "?" in the query the goal here is to detect the
  intent of the user whether any question is asked or not in the query:

  who is the father of arya stark?
  which country was jon snow filmed in
  who are the younger brothers of arya stark?

  Statements (Declarative Queries):

  Such queries consist also of a regular, natural sentence with semantic
  relations between the words. However, they are rather a statement than
  a question:

  Arya stark was a daughter of a lord.
  Show countries that Jon snow was filmed in.
  List all brothers of Arya.
