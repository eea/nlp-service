The projects were: Freshwater Ecosystem Services Mapping and Assessment in Bulgaria (FEMA) \u2013 also assessing marine ecosystems, Wetland Ecosystem Services Mapping and Assessment in Bulgaria (WEMA), Assessment and mapping of grassland ecosystems condition and their services in Bulgaria (IBER-GRASS), Mapping and assessment of sparsely vegetated land ecosystem services in Bulgaria (SPA-Ecoservices), Toward better Understanding the Ecosystem Services in Urban environments trough assessment and mapping (TUNESinURB), Ecosystem services mapping and assessment of heathland and schrubs ecosystems in Bulgaria outside NATURA 2000 (SHE-BG) \u2013 also assessing cropland ecosystems, and Forests and woodlands - ecosystem services mapping and assessment in the Bulgarian Forest territories outside NATURA 2000 network (FOR OUR FUTURE). The projects further performed additional activities for some ecosystem types, notably an assessment of Ecological Focused Areas (EFAs) in two pilot locations, urban mapping in two pilot cities, and a socio-economic assessment of the heathland and shrubs ecosystem services.\nBefore, in parallel and after the mapping and assessment, two horizontal projects ensured the coordination of the mapping projects:\n- Project PDP02 - Methodological Support for Ecosystem Services Mapping and Biophysical Valuation (MetEcoSMap) created the Methodological Framework for assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services in Bulgaria, peer reviewed by MAES members. The framework provides a national typology of ecosystems that combines the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) classes with the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitat classification types. In addition, water ecosystem indicators (freshwater and marine) are also structured to be as close as possible to indicators for the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In this manner, compatibility is ensured between the EU-level classifications used in different types of legislation. MetEcoSMap also resolved methodological issues during the mapping and assessment phase, tested the framework\u2019s landscape level mapping and assessment component \u2013 the in situ verification guide, and performed data collection for running the ESTIMAP pollination model for Bulgaria in cooperation with JRC. Meta \u2013 barcoding was also tested as a biodiversity assessment method.\n- Project Improving the Bulgarian Biodiversity Information System (IBBIS) ensured the data collection back-end for all projects in programme BG03, including the mapping and assessment projects and some other projects that may inform ecosystem monitoring \u2013 such as East and South European Network for Invasive Alien Species - A tool to support the management of alien species in Bulgaria (ESENIAS-TOOLS), citizen science and policy-related projects for biodiversity outside NATURA 2000. The IBBIS project performed consistency checking of all data at the time of its receipt, developed the necessary IT infrastructure for displaying the mapping datasets, supporting volunteer data collection and interface with the forest and Invasive Alien Species databases. After the consistency check, the mapping and assessment datasets were published online.\nReferences\n1.

A clear and all-inclusive strategy on how to achieve these goals (and for what purpose) is still lacking, but it is currently in development.\nIn 2017-2018, a six-month project dedicated to kick-starting Ecosystem Services valuation and integration process at the national level was carried out. Among the project results were: current situation analysis; expert survey on the ecosystem and ecosystem services condition in Lithuania; stakeholder engagement and awareness raising activities; CICES translation into Lithuanian; and a proposal for improving integration of the ecosystems, their services and biodiversity considerations into sectoral policies.\nLINESAM: NATIONAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ASSESSMENT AND MAPPING PROJECT\nA national MAES project \u2012 LINESAM, Lithuanian national ecosystem services assessment and mapping (2017-2021) \u2012 is currently being carried out in Lithuania. LINESAM is a project by an international team based at Mykolas Romeris University, funded by the Lithuanian Research Council. Although the project was not commissioned by the Lithuanian Ministry of Environment (as is usually the case with national MAES studies in other Member States), the Ministry is working closely with the Project team, having signed a Partnership agreement with the University in October 2018.\n- Goals:\n- Developing a national Ecosystem Services mapping and assessment framework to improve the understanding of the relationships between ecosystems, biodiversity and human wellbeing and how drivers of change may affect Ecosystem Services supply in Lithuania\n- Supporting the development of planning and management strategies grounded on socio-ecological principles of ecosystems and biodiversity\n- Creating a common knowledge baseline on Ecosystem Services\n- Timeline:\n- Interim report expected second half of 2019\n- Project end \u2012 second half of 2021\n- Deliverables:\n- Geoportal (in English) where the data layers, maps, assessments and various other publications will be published.

Data were collected from official bodies and resources on the main categories of ecosystem services (i.e. Provisioning, Regulating and maintenance, Cultural). For the categorization of the collected data, the main categories of the National Set of Ecosystem Services Indicators (previous deliverable of Action A3) were used, i.e.: Biodiversity, Environmental Quality, Food, material and energy, Forestry, Recreation, Water resources. The results of the analysis highlighted areas where a) simultaneous occurrence of data for the various categories of ecosystem services is observed and b) data gaps are evident. Consequently, a series of relevant thematic maps have been created, which form the basis for the selection and identification of areas where further research and prioritization for the implementation of Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services is required. The final thematic maps (Ecosystem services\u2019 priority areas maps of Greece), which is the core of this Deliverable, form the basis for further research and the communication of the until-now results towards the decision- and policy- making centers. These maps also contribute and support the efforts towards implementation of national and European policies for the environment and sustainable development\n- Dimopoulos, P., Kokkoris, \u0399., Chrysafi, I. & Mallinis, G., (2020).

This deliverable presents a workflow regarding land use/ cover (LULC) classification, with the aid of Remote Sensing, which was used in order to map ecosystem types that are located outside Natura 2000 in Greece. Specifically, machine learning classification algorithm models have been developed and assessed. The compiled models were based on an object-based classification approach and incorporated/included free-access satellite data, such as Sentinel-1 A/B and Sentinel-2 imagery. Moreover, LULC geospatial data, which cover the entire of Greece, have been employed (e.g. vector data), along with land cover products such as the EU High Resolution Layers that have been acquired via the Copernicus programme. The developed methodology managed to handle effectively the challenges that were related to the computational and time requirements regarding data processing and analysis for the mapping of ecosystems at national scale with the use of cloud computing and specifically by employing the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The report comprises of four chapters. Chapter 1 introduces basic terms and definitions regarding ecosystems. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of ecosystem mapping. Chapter 2 presents the methodology which was employed for the development of the ecosystem types classification models and also analyzes the workflow steps that were followed for the effective mapping of ecosystem types in Greece (outside Natura 2000), in order to fulfil the sub-action A.3.1 objectives while it also provides a synoptic description of cloud computing technology for remote sensing data processing. Chapter 3 involves the assessment/evaluation of the classification models that were developed and also presents the results of accuracy assessment and the quality of the compiled maps. Finally, Chapter 4 provides a synoptic discussion concerning the results of the compiled maps and the methodological approach that was employed.\n- Verde, N., Kokkoris, \u0399., Dimopoulos, P., Korakis, G., & Mallinis, G.

(2018) (updated, September 2019)\n- The present study aims to (i) synthesize the ecosystem services literature relevant to the ES implementation in Greece, (ii) validate and classify each literature source to the relevant ecosystem services categories, (iii) identify shortcomings in terms of ES assessed and data available, and (iv) critically review the variety of approaches to ES assessments that are followed. The outcomes of this study will facilitate the efficient implementation of ecosystem services assessments in Greece\n- Presentation at the ESP Regional Conference of the study entitled: \u201cEcosystem services as a tool for policy support and decision making: an exploratory assessment in a protected mountainous lake (Stymfalia, Greece)\u201d, by Kokkoris et al. (2018) (updated, September 2019)\n- This is a large-scale study in a Natura 2000 protected area (Special Area for Conservation), which includes biophysical and social assessment as well as economic valuation for future scenarios, to support decision and policy making. This is the first study in Greece which uses all available datasets from EU funded Projects (e.g. Monitoring projects for Habitats, Water resources etc.), in a Natura 2000 site, develops future scenarios and provides economic valuation for key ecosystem services\nPresentation at the ESP Regional Conference of the study entitled: \u201cInsights from an exploratory assessment of Cultural Ecosystem Services in Greece\u201d, by Vlami et al. (2018) (updated, September 2019)\nIn this research we screen for and identify several CES indicators within the Natura 2000 Network of Greece, as well as outside the Network where data was available. This assessment resulted in the compilation of a set of indicators ranging from specialized outdoor recreation interests (such as nature-viewing infrastructure, rafting areas, sacred natural sites, etc.) to site characterization proxies (such as blue-flag beach designations, traditional agriculture, \"mythical landscapes\" etc.). The analysis revealed that some types of indicators show redundancy or/and are complementary, while others are extremely specialized (e.g. birdwatching hotspots). GIS analysis produced heat maps and hotspots complementing a prioritization scheme that assists in highlighting the cultural ecosystem services both at the protected area scale and broader regional scale. A key outcome of the study is that uncertainties are defined and major gaps in progress are expressed. Thus, the analyses provide a kaleidoscope effect that may be helpful in expressing screening-level state-wide CES evaluations.\nPresentation at the inter-regional workshop \u201cIncredible: innovation networks for cork, resins & edibles\u201d of the study entitled: Diversity and ecosystem services of the flora of Greece: the case study of Lamiaceae, by Cheminal et al. (2019) (updated, September 2019)\nThis study focuses on the Lamiaceae endemic to Greece, a country well-known for its high endemism rate. This report first aims to summarize the properties (aromatic, medical potential, environmental interest...) and compositions of each taxon, and to evaluate the distribution of these rare plants. Maps have been created using GIS, pointing at hotspots and gaps in the repartition of the species, but also at patterns in the geographical repartition of the properties of interest. The gaps in the knowledge about these endemics are also highlighted at the taxon, molecule and geographical levels, showing on which fields further studies could be led. The review-and-location method used in this study could be seen as a tool for the management of the exploitation and of the protection of the endemic species of use. The limits and applications of this method are discussed\n- Participation and presentation of the MAES implementation progress in Greece via the LIFE-IP 4 NATURA, at High-level Conference for Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystem Service in EU, 13 Dec 2019, Helsinki (Oral presentation title: MAES implementation in Greece: a national-scale assessment for ecosystem condition and ecosystem services).

Department of Biology, University of Patras (updated, September 2019)\nThis work refers to selected mountains in Peloponnese (Mt. Panachaikon) and in the island of Evvia (Mt. Ochi), within the Natura 2000 network, where some of the largest wind farms in the country are operating or are under construction. Main aim of the study is to contribute to Action 5 of Target 2 of the European Biodiversity Strategy, by Mapping and Assessing Ecosystems and their Services (MAES). Using the Natura 2000 datasets and data from environmental studies for the studied wind farms, a matrix of biophysical parameters was created; these parameters were assigned to actual and potential supply of the relevant ecosystem services (following CICES) which were evaluated and mapped at the local-scale. Identification and assessment of wind farms' impact(s) on (a) ecosystem condition, (b) important plant species, (c) important bird species and (d) the trade-offs between the benefits of \"green\" energy production and ecosystems' condition and their ability to provide ecosystem services. Results on ecosystems' and species' condition, as well as the identification and assessment of ecosystem services are presented in thematic maps. The main conclusion is that the maintenance of a \"sound\" balance between wind energy production and the conservation of biophysical parameters should act as a main tool for protected areas' sustainable management.\n\u2022PhD Thesis (ongoing): Diversity of species, habitats and ecosystems in the context of the ecosystem services framework at Chelmos-Vouraikos National Park and UNESCO Global Geopark, (S Peloponnisos, Greece): This study deals with local, fine scale mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services at the National Park and UNESCO Global Geopark of Chelmos-Vouraikos. All available datasets from the study area will be exploited, combined with field survey data for detailed ecosystem type mapping and ecosystem services assessments (supply, demand, capacity). A decision support scheme will be developed to support decision making and conservation policy actions under the holistic MAES framework, as proposed for the EU Member States. (Department of Biology, University of Patras) (February 2021 update)\nThis is an online tool for the spatial distribution of plant taxa in the phytogeographical areas of Greece. It provides useful information on spatial patterns and biodiversity hot-spots in Greece. We use this large database of plant taxa for functional trait assignment to each plant taxon, especially the ones of high importance (endemic at different scales-national, regional, local, range-restricted, single-mountain and single-island endemics).\nThe project \u201cFloristic Diversity and Ecosystem Services in Greece\u201d is related to the outputs of the Flora of Greece database and is currently in progress. With the aim to investigate the role of biodiversity in the provision and maintenance of multiple ecosystem services, the patterns of floristic diversity in Greece (total taxonomic- and endemic- diversity, exclusive total-, range-restricted- and endemic- diversity per phytogeographical region), as well as of the functional diversity for the exclusive endemics of the Peloponnesian mountains (regional scale) have been examined. Preliminary results include: (I) Assessment and mapping of \"hot spot\" areas considering a) their plant diversity, b) the quantitative representation of taxon richness in different habitat/ecosystem categories, c) the actual- and the potential- supply of ecosystem services. (II) Correlation of taxonomic indices with supplied ecosystem services per phytogeographical region. The synthesis of the examined diversity indices, their correlation and spatial congruence with ecosystems per phytogeographical region document the importance of each region for ecosystem services supply (actual and potential).\n- In the frame of the LIFE project Natura2000ValueCrete (The ecological services, social benefits and economic value of the Ecosystem Services in Natura 2000 sites in Crete), a workshop under the title: \u201cManagement of the NATURA 2000 sites: New challenges, good practices and consultation with society\u201d was organized recently (8th October 2018) in the island of Crete.\nA presentation by Prof. P. Dimopoulos gave emphasis on \u201cthe Ecosystem Services as a tool for sustainable management in the protected areas\u201d. Other participants/invited speakers discussed \u201cthe integration of the role of the protected areas in the sustainable development\u201d (Prof. Ifigenia Kagalou). Representatives of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy presented the \u201cframework for the Management Plans of the protected areas\u201d (Melina Koutsogianni), as well as \u201cthe role of the Management Bodies to the implementation of Management actions within the protected areas\u201d (Dr. Anastasia Dalaka).\n- Participation as a full partner in the Horizon 2020 Project \u201cMapping and Assessment for Integrated ecosystem Accounting (MAIA)\u201d (February 2021 update)\nOur contribution refers to ecosystem extent, biodiversity assessment and analyses, to the assessment of freshwater-related services (water quality and provision), as well as on economic valuation methods to fulfil the objectives of the project. This is the first approach to implement MAES -mapping, assessment and valuation- at regional scale in Greece. Stakeholder consultation is held using a questionnaire survey, targeted to key stakeholders. An extensive workshop to exchange information with State authorities, stakeholders and academia, has been conducted before the pandemic restrictions, and by this identified current knowledge, data gaps and policy needs. Current work focuses on ecosystem extent accounts for woodland and forest ecosystems, creation of proxy indicators for nation-wide ecosystem condition accounting based on biodiversity and water resources accounting\nDate: 22/02/2021", "MAES\nMAES-related developments in Finland\nFinland has actively participated in Esmeralda project which continues the previous ecosystem service assessment works such as TEEB for Finland study (Towards Sustainable and Genuinely Green Economy - The value and social significance of ecosystem services in Finland), and development of the Finnish Ecosystem Services Indicators \u2013 a national framework that integrates CICES classification and Cascade model; see www.biodiversity.fi/ecosystemservices. This internet portal is gradually being developed as a Finnish National CBD Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) under the Convention on Biological Diversity. It aims at synthesizing the knowledge on the status of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and for instance, to serve as the national webpage of Nagoya Protocol on genetic resources and Cartagena Protocol on biosafety. The information processed for this portal is also the basis for national reporting to the CBD. For example, the 5th National report on the implementation of CBD Aichi targets, was compiled with the help of this portal and distributed to the CBD Secretariat in March 2014.\nToday, MAES related developments in Finland can be categorized under four classes:\n1) Networking and information sharing. National network of people and institutes who are interested in MAES and doing MAES-related work was established and a kick-off meeting was arranged in 2016, at SYKE in Helsinki. The network is volunteer-based, but biodiversity.fi \u2013portal is offered for presenting mapping results under the associated indicator categories. The aim is to arrange meeting yearly, to update recent findings, and keep cooperation networks informed about the MAES process. Ministry of the Environment has supported this work yearly.\n2) Supporting land use planning. Local stakeholders such as county planners and natural resource managers have got interested in possibilities of mapping work. For instance, GreenFrame and ESTIMAP mapping approaches has been applied in several regions in Finland (counties and municipalities), and for integrated coastal zone management. Municipalities have been also interested in mapping their carbon storages (Akuj\u00e4rvi et al. 2016). However, this progress is mainly based on individual projects.\n3) Integrated Natural Capital Accounting. There has been increasing national level interest towards the MAES applications, especially for KIP-INCA work. Finnish Environment Institute, Natural Resource Institute and Statistics Finland have discussed collaboration possibilities to integrate MAES and INCA work. A NCA seminar will be arranged in May 2017. A background report by J\u00e4ppinen & Heli\u00f6l\u00e4 was published 2016 and an on-going pilot study funded by the Ministry of the Environment will be conducted in 2017.\n4) Preparing for ecosystem condition assessment. Technological potential of remote sensing and other environmental monitoring techniques has developed fast, but their potential in monitoring of ecosystem condition is poorly harvested. Finnish environmental research infrastructure development project ENVIBASE has improved facilities to use new Earth Observation data (e.g. Sentinels, Copernicus data services). Applications, such as ecosystem condition assessment, using this data possibility, should be demonstrated next. We have been assessing also how the concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables by GEO BON could be used to support national biodiversity and ecosystem services monitoring (Vihervaara et al. 2017). Bridging the gaps between different research group initiatives is high in our future agenda.\nMore information available at Finnish Environment Institute\nSelected recent publications and reports related to Finnish Ecosystem Service research:\n2017\nSalomaa, A., Paloniemi, R., Kotiaho, J.S., Kettunen, M. & Apostolopoulou, E. 2017: Can green infrastructure help to conserve biodiversity?Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space 35(2): 265-288.\n2016\nPotschin, M.B., Primmer, E., Furman, E. & Haines-Young, R.H. 2016: Have ecosystem services been oversold? : A response to Silvertown.

For this, several studies have been conducted by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management, also dealing with Ecosystem Services. Aim of a was to assess the condition and importance of biological diversity in Austria, to describe Ecosystem Services in a common language and to depict possible conflicts, e. g. effects of soil sealing on various services. The mapping and assessing of ecosystems and their services is also part of the .Other activities so far were undertaken by the Environment Agency Austria, such as a national wide mapping of ecosystems based on the EUNIS classification (105 classes from level 2 to 4) with a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 metres.\nMapping and assessing of a set of Ecosystem Services on a regional level was conducted within the project for two case studies in R\u00f6merland Carnuntum and Oststeirisches Kernland. A presented an inventory of ecosystem services in agricultural context, an followed in 2015. Also in 2015, a of ecosystem services. Furthermore, contributions were made to the project by examining the costs of climate change and its effects on two ecosystem services (pest control and pollination).\nOn European scale activities included the participation in MESEU or contributions, e.g. to the creation of the Map of European ecosystem types based on the EUNIS classification and ecosystem assessment as part of ETC-SIA.
