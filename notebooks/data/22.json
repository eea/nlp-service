Good status is comprised of four assessments:\n> Ecological status of surface waters\n> Chemical status of surface waters\n> Chemical status of groundwaters\n> Quantitative status of groundwaters\nIn 2022, the Commission will come forward with a new legislative proposal on integrated water management, focused on regulating polluting substances , as part of the European Green Deal, in the context of these Directives.\nAchieving good status involves meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry and quantity of waters. The Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC) and Environmental Quality Standards Directive (2008/105/EC), both set additional groundwater and priority substance standards relevant for assessments of the Water Framework Directive.\nFIGURE 1\nAssessment of status of surface waters and groundwater according to the WFD\nSource: European waters. Assessment of status and pressures 2018. EEA Report No 7/2018\nMonitoring and reporting under the WFD\nThe Water Framework Directive requires reporting of river basin management plans, every six years. The last round took place in 2016, the next round of reporting comes up in 2022. Each river basin management plan covers one of the 180 river basins, and includes the assessment of its water bodies, their pressures as well as relevant plans towards achieving good status. Surface waters includes rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters. The Water Framework Directive is being implemented by the EU and Norway. In the EU and Norway, more than 146 500 surface waterbodies and 15 000 groundwater bodies are covered by assessments under the Water Framework Directive.\nTo know more about surface and groundwater bodies, visit the Data visualisation tools section, in particular:\n> The dashboards and maps of Delineation of surface water bodies\n> The dashboards and maps of Delineation of groundwater bodies\nOr the specific dashboards:\n> Surface water bodies: Number and size, by category\n> Groundwater bodies: Number and size, by geological formation [table]\nAssessment methodology of the WFD\nGood status is comprised of four assessments: ecological and chemical status of surface waters, and chemical and quantitative status of groundwater.\nEcological status of surface waters assesses overall ecosystem health as expressed by biological quality elements \u2014 phytoplankton, macrophytes, phytobenthos, benthic invertebrate fauna and fish, and if good status is not achieved, assessments are further supported by assessments of hydromorphology and the physico-chemical parameters: nutrients, oxygen condition, temperature, transparency, salinity and river basin-specific pollutants. The ecological status assessments comprise assessments of a number of different parameters. Achieving good status implies that all parameter must be in at least good status. This is also referred to as the oe out all out principle.\nChemical status of surface water is assessed against standards for priority substances listed in the Environmetal Quality Standards Directive. These standards are set to protect the most sensitive aquatic species, as well as humans who in return can be affected by secondary poisoning.\nGood groundwater chemical status is achieved when concentrations of specified substances do not exceed those permitted by relevant standards and when concentrations do not prevent associated surface water bodies from achieving good status or cause significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems that depend directly on the groundwater in question\nGood groundwater quantitative status is achieved by ensuring that the available groundwater resource is not deteriorated by the long-term annual average rate of abstraction. Accordingly, the level of groundwater should not lead to any reduction in the ecological status of connected surface waters or in groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, reversals in the direction of flow should not result in saline (or other) intrusions.", "Ecological status of surface waters in Europe\nThe Water Framework Directive aims to achieve good status for all rivers, lakes and transitional and coastal waters in the EU.

The other is chemical status of surface waters.\nIntroduction\nEcological status is a composite assessment of the quality surface water ecosystems. It shows the combined impact of pressures such as pollution, habitat degradation and climate change.\nDo you know?\nIn Europe, 40 % of the surface water bodies are in good or high ecological status\nLakes and coastal waters have better status than rivers and transitional waters\nSince 2009, biological quality elements in some water bodies have improved, but not enough to improve the overall ecological status\nEcological status\nEcological status is assessed for all water bodies designated in rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters. It is based on assessing the status of biological quality elements and supported by physico\u2011chemical and hydromorphological quality. The outcome of the ecological status assessment falls into one of five status classes (FIGURE 1).\nThe overall objective is to achieve good or high status.\nFIGURE 1\nAssessment of ecological status of surface water bodies\nSource: European waters. Assessment of status and pressures 2018. EEA Report No 7/2018\nEcological Status assessments are performed by all EU Member States every 6 years, in 2009, 2015, and 2021. On the scale of Europe, around 40 % of the surface water bodies are in good or high ecological status, with lakes and coastal waters having better status than rivers and transitional waters (FIGURE 2). The overall ecological status has not improved since 2009 but it has improved for some biological quality elements between 2009 and 2015. The results of the 2021 assessments are not yet known.\nThe ecological status for a water body is determined according to the 'one out, all out' principle. This principle implies that a water body can only achieve good status if all biological and supporting quality elements are assessed at least as good. In other words, the quality element with the worst status determines the overall status.\nWater bodies in moderate, poor or bad ecological status require mitigation and restoration to achieve the good status objective. To plan such measures, the pressures that prevent water bodies from achieving good ecological status must be identified. These pressures include point sources of pollution, diffuse sources of pollution, water abstraction, and hydrological and morphological alterations. Types of impacts include nutrients, organic and chemical pollution, altered habitats and acidification.\nFIGURE 2\nSurface water bodies: Ecological status or potential, by category.

The blue areas show where more than half of water bodies are in good ecological status. These are found in the northern countries, particularly the northern Scandinavian region and Scotland, as well as Estonia, Romania, Slovakia and in the Mediterranean region. In contrast, red areas show where less than half of water bodies achieve good ecological status.

The first \n\nreporting of the River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) under the WFD was due at the end of 2009.  \n\nMost Member States have reported their RBMPs and delivered an enormous amount of data on status \n\nand pressures to the Water Information System for Europe (WISE) WFD database. This report - \n\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters - is based on an assessment of the \n\nRBMP data reported by Member States together with other related sources of information and has \n\nbeen done by the European Topic Centre for Inland, Coastal and Marine Waters (ETC-ICM) in close \n\ncollaboration with the EEA. The main aim of the report has been to provide an assessment of the \n\nstatus of Europe's waters and the pressures affecting them. The report is used as a background report \n\nfor the EEA 2012 'State of Europe's water' assessments, which reflects the cooperation with the \n\nCommission on the assessment of implementation of the WFD as laid out in Article 18 of the WFD. \n\nThis article states that:  \n\n'The EU Commission shall publish a report on the implementation of this directive at the latest \n\n12 years after the date of entry into force of this directive (two years after the Member States have \n\ndelivered the RBMPs). The report shall among others include the following:  \n\n\u2022 A review of progress in the implementation of the directive  \n\n\u2022 A review of the status of surface water and groundwater in the Community undertaken \n\nin coordination with the European Environment Agency.  \n\n \n\nConstraints on confidence due to data gaps and methodology issues  \n\nThe quality of the assessment relies on the quality of the Member States' reports and data delivery. \n\nThere are examples of very good, high quality reporting. However, there are many reporting gaps \n\nor contradictions that can lead to wrong and/or incomplete assessments.  \n\nDue to delays in the development of national classification systems in many Member States, only \n\na few biological quality elements could be used for assessing ecological status of water bodies for the \n\nfirst RBMPs. Many water bodies have been classified without actual monitoring of biology or \n\nchemical pollutants, mainly using expert judgment based on the information compiled in the pressure \n\nand impact analyses (WFD article 5). Thus, the confidence in the classification of the ecological and \n\nchemical status was often low in the first RBMPs. However, compared to the situation before the \n\nWFD, there has been a significant improvement of the knowledge base and increased transparency by \n\nbringing together information on status, pressures and impacts on water bodies at river basin level.  \n\nCaution is advised concerning country and river basin district (RBD) comparisons, as results may be \n\naffected by the methodology approach used by a particular individual Member State. Likewise, it is \n\nnot advisable to draw detailed conclusions on the chemical status results, as there was a lack of \n\nchemical monitoring and of comparability of the information on chemical status of water bodies \n\namong Member States. Nevertheless, it is the authors\u2018 opinion that the main European overview of the \n\necological status Europe's waters and the pressures affecting them reflects the reality emerging from \n\nthe current state of knowledge.  \n\n \n\f\n8 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nEcological and chemical status, pressures and impacts  \n\nThe WFD requires that all the issues mentioned above are addressed in order to ensure that by 2015 \n\nall water bodies have good status. For surface waters, there are two separate classifications, ecological \n\nand chemical status. Groundwater bodies are classified according to their chemical status and \n\nquantitative status. For a water body to be in overall good status, both chemical status and ecological \n\nor quantitative status must be at least good.  \n\nThe European Union (EU) Member States have via the RBMPs reported information from more than \n\n127 000 surface water bodies: 82% of them rivers, 15% lakes, and 3% coastal and transitional waters, \n\nas well as from more than 13 000 groundwater bodies. The results are presented below.  \n\nEcological status  \n\n\u2022 More than half of the surface water bodies in Europe are reported to be in less than good \n\necological status or potential, and will need mitigation and/or restoration measures to meet the \n\nWFD objective.  \n\n\u2022 River water bodies and transitional waters are reported to have worse ecological status or potential \n\nand more pressures and impacts compared to water bodies in lakes and coastal waters.  \n\n\u2022 The pressures reported to affect most surface water bodies are pollution from diffuse sources, \n\nin particular from agriculture, causing nutrient enrichment, and hydromorphological pressures \n\nresulting in altered habitats.  \n\n\u2022 The worst areas of Europe concerning ecological status and pressures in freshwater are in central \n\nand north-western Europe, while for coastal and transitional waters, the Baltic Sea and Greater \n\nNorth Sea regions are the worst.  \n\nA large proportion of water bodies, particularly in the regions with intensive agriculture and high \n\npopulation density have poor ecological status and are affected by pollution pressures. The situation \n\ncalls for increased attention to achieve good water quality and ecological status. Despite some \n\nprogress in reducing agricultural inputs of pollutants, diffuse pollution from agriculture is a significant \n\npressure in more than 40% of Europe's water bodies in rivers and coastal waters, and in one third \n\nof the water bodies in lakes and transitional waters. The RBDs and Member States with a high \n\nproportion of water bodies affected by diffuse pollution are found in north-western Europe in \n\nparticular, and correspond to the regions with high fertilizer input and high river nitrate concentration. \n\nDischarges from wastewater treatment plants and industries and the overflow of wastewater from \n\nsewage systems still cause pollution: 22% of water bodies still have point sources as a significant \n\npressure.  \n\nHydromorphological modifications causing altered habitats are the other most commonly occurring \n\npressures in rivers, lakes and transitional waters, affecting around 40% of river and transitional water \n\nbodies and 30% of the lake water bodies. The hydromorphological pressures are mainly attributable to \n\nhydropower, navigation, agriculture, flood protection and urban development. Further information on \n\nhydromorphological pressures and impacts are available in a separate Hydromorphology assessment \n\nreport available at the ETC-ICM web-site (EEA ETC/ICM, 2012). \n\nChemical status  \n\nThe information provided in the RBMPs on chemical status is not sufficiently clear to establish \n\na baseline for 2009. The chemical quality of water bodies has improved significantly in the last \n\n30 years, but the situation as regards the priority substances introduced by the WFD is not clear. The \n\nassessment of chemical status presents a large proportion of water bodies with unknown status. \n\nMonitoring is clearly insufficient and inadequate in many Member States, where not all priority \n\nsubstances are monitored and the number of water bodies being monitored is very limited. The results \n\nfrom the first RBMPs showed that:  \n\n\u2022 Poor chemical status for groundwater, by area, is about 25% across Europe. A total of 16 Member \n\nStates have more than 10% of groundwater bodies in poor chemical status; this figure exceeds \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 9 \n\n50% in four Member States. Excessive levels of nitrate are the most frequent cause of poor \n\ngroundwater status across much of Europe.  \n\n\u2022 Poor chemical status for rivers, lakes, and transitional and coastal waters does not exceed 10%, \n\naggregated across Europe as a whole. Notably, the chemical status of many of Europe's surface \n\nwaters remains unknown, ranging between one third of the lakes and more than half of the \n\ntransitional waters.  \n\n\u2022 A total of 10 Member States report poor chemical status in more than 20% of rivers and lakes with \n\nknown chemical status, whilst this figure rises to above 40% in five Member States.  \n\n\u2022 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a widespread cause of poor status in rivers. Heavy \n\nmetals are also a significant contributor to poor status in rivers and lakes, with levels of mercury \n\nin Swedish freshwater biota causing 100% failure to reach good chemical status. Industrial \n\nchemicals such as the plasticiser di (2 ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and agro-chemical pesticides \n\nalso constitute widespread causes of poor chemical status in rivers.  \n\n\u2022 Six Member States report poor chemical status in transitional waters to be more than 50% of the \n\nwater bodies with known chemical status. PAHs, the antifouling biocide tributyltin (TBT) and \n\nheavy metals are the most common culprits.  \n\n\u2022 Six Member States report all their coastal waters as having good chemical status, although in five \n\nothers, poor chemical status exceeds 90% of the water bodies with a known chemical status. \n\nA variety of pollutant groups contribute to poor status in coastal waters, reflecting a diverse range \n\nof sources. \n\nEcologic status and water quality  \n\nPollutants in many of Europe's surface waters have led to detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems \n\nand the loss of freshwater flora and fauna. Implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment \n\nDirective, together with comparable non-EU legislation, has led to improvements in wastewater \n\ntreatment across much of the continent. This has resulted in reduced point discharges of nutrients and \n\norganic pollution to freshwater bodies. Clear downward trends in water quality determinants related to \n\nurban and industrial wastewater are evident in most of Europe's surface waters, although these trends \n\nhave leveled in recent years, and is more conspicuous in rivers than it the other water categories. \n\nDespite improvements in some regions, diffuse pollution from agriculture remains a major cause \n\nof the poor water quality currently observed in parts of Europe, contributing 50-80% of the total \n\nnitrogen load and approximately half of the total phosphorus load on Europe\u2018s freshwaters. \n\nEcological status is clearly correlated with nutrients in all surface water categories.  Much lower \n\nnutrient concentrations are found in water bodies with high and good ecological status than in those \n\nwith moderate or worse ecological status. \n\nProjections of trends in river water bodies currently in moderate or worse ecological status indicate \n\nthat good status may be achieved in 2027 for phosphorus (if the current trend continues), but not for \n\nnitrate. \n\nThe results show the need for further nutrient reduction measures, in particular addressing diffuse \n\nsource pollution from agriculture, which can be implemented through the WFD RBMPs and through \n\nfull compliance with the Nitrates Directive. \n\n \n\f\n10 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\n1. Introduction  \n\n1.1. EEA 2012 state of Europe\u2019s water reports \n\nEurope's waters are affected by several pressures including water pollution, water scarcity, floods; and \n\nby major modifications affecting morphology and water flow. To maintain and improve the essential \n\nfunctions of our water ecosystems, we need to manage them well. This can only succeed if we adopt \n\nthe integrated approach introduced in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and other water \n\npolicies. Europe has via the WFD and other water policies strong water legislation in place and the \n\nchallenge now is to see how it works in practice. \n\n2012 is the European year of water in which the European Commission published its \u2015Blue-print to \n\nsafeguard European waters\u2016 comprising reviews of the WFD, water scarcity and drought and \n\nvulnerability and adaptation policies. To accompany and inform the Blue-print the EEA has \n\nthroughout 2012 produced a set of reports on the \u2015State of Europe\u2018s water\u2016. The reports are developed \n\nin close cooperation and coordination with the European Commission DG Environment\u2018s assessment \n\nof the WFD River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) and the other work preparing the Blue-print to \n\nsafeguard Europe\u2018s water resources. \n\nThe Commission has published its third WFD implementation report as required by Article 18 of the \n\nWFD. This third implementation report is formed by the Communication from the Commission to the \n\nEuropean Parliament and to the Council on the Water Framework Directive implementation report \n\n(EC, 2012a), plus this Commission Staff Working Document on the European Overview of the \n\nimplementation (EC, 2012b) and another Commission Staff Working Document (EC, 2012c) with a \n\nset of annexes describing the results of the assessment by the Commission of the RBMPs relating to \n\neach Member State. \n\nThe EEA 2012 State of Europe\u2018s water assessments consist of three thematic assessments and an \n\noverarching synthesis and integrated report. \n\n- Efficient Use of Water Resources (World Water Forum, Marseilles, March 2012) \n\n- Vulnerability (Water scarcity and drought, floods, water quality) \u2013 Autumn 2012 \n\n- European waters \u2013 assessment of status and pressures \u2013 Autumn 2012  \n\nIn addition, a number of EEA/ETC-ICM technical background reports and documents by the ETC \n\nICM are published, these report will contain more detailed information and results on the assessment \n\nof information from RBMPS on status and pressures \n\n- WFD: Ecological and chemical status and pressures \u2013 Autumn 2012  \n\n- WFD: Hydromorphology \u2013 Autumn 2012 \n\n- Water scarcity and drought, Floods etc. \n\nThis report is compiled from information on the status of European rivers, lakes and coastal water \n\nbodies as reported from EU-Member States in the first round of RBMPs under the WFD. This work \n\nby the EEA reflects the cooperation with the EU Commission on the assessment of implementation of \n\nthe WFD as laid out in Article 18 of the WFD according to which:  \n\nThe EU Commission shall publish a report on the implementation of this Directive at the latest 12 \n\nyears after the date of entry into force of this Directive (two years after the Member States have \n\ndelivered the RBMPs). The report shall among others include the following: \n\n\uf0b7 a review of progress in the implementation of the Directive; \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 11 \n\n\uf0b7 a review of the status of surface water and groundwater in the Community undertaken in \n\ncoordination with the European Environment Agency. \n\nThe information from the RBMPs is accompanied by information on the status of European waters, \n\nwhich the EEA has collected since the mid-1990s within its EIONET (European Information and \n\nObservation NETwork). This information following the agreement in the agencies regulation, gives in \n\naddition and complementary to the WFD information a certain trend analysis and with this helps \n\nproviding a baseline for future evaluation of the WFD achievements and underlying directives. \n\nThe RBMPs are comprehensive documents that cover many aspects of water management, consisting \n\nof hundreds to thousands of pages of information. They were published in the national languages. The \n\nassessment of the plans is therefore a very challenging and complex task that involves dealing with \n\nextensive information in more than 20 languages. The quality of the EEAs assessments relies on the \n\nquality of the Member States' reports and data delivery. Bad or incomplete reporting can lead to \n\nwrong and/or incomplete assessments. \n\n1.1.1. Geographical settings \n\nEurope has an extensive network of rivers and streams summing to several million kilometres of \n\nflowing waters, and more than a million lakes cover the European continent. The European Union has \n\na long coastline\n(1)\n\n and several hundreds of transitional waters in the form of fjords, estuaries, lagoons, \n\nand deltas. Each body of water has its own characteristics.  \n\nRiver Basin Districts \n\nThe implementation of the WFD has resulted in the designation of 111 river basin districts (RBDs) \n\nacross the EU (Map 1.1). Since 40 river basin districts are international, there are around 180 national \n\nRBDs or national parts of international RBDs. The international RBDs cover more than 60% of the \n\nterritory of the EU. An important feature of the WFD is a planning mechanism, referred to as \n\ninternational river basin plans, by which Member States should co-operate to ensure that \n\nenvironmental objectives targets are met. \n\nEurope's seas include the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Black, and Mediterranean Seas. The North East \n\nAtlantic includes the North Sea, but also the Arctic and Barents Seas, the Irish Sea, and the Celtic Sea, \n\nBay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n(1)\n\n Coastal waters represent the interface between land and ocean, and in the context of the Water Framework \n\nDirective coastal waters include water, that has not been designated as transitional water, extending one nautical \n\nmile from a baseline defined by the land points where territorial waters are measured. \n\f\n12 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nMap 1.1 Map of river basin districts and sea regions used in the report \n\n \nSource: Administrative boundaries: European Commission - Eurostat/GISCO and WISE River basin districts \n\n(RBDs) processed by the ETC/ICM. \n\n1.2. European water policies  \n\nThe main aim of EU water policy is to ensure that throughout the EU a sufficient quantity of good \n\nquality water is available for people\u2018s needs and for the environment. Since the 1970s, through \n\na variety of measures, the EU has worked hard to create an effective and coherent water policy. \n\nThe first directives, adopted in the mid-1970s, established a series of quality standards aimed at \n\nprotecting human health and the living environment, including surface water used for drinking water, \n\nbathing water, fish waters, shellfish waters, groundwater and water for human consumption. In the \n\nsame \"generation\" of legislation, a directive that set standards for the discharge of dangerous \n\nsubstances into the aquatic environment was for many years the main instrument to control emissions \n\nfrom industry (see also EC (2008a)). \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 13 \n\nHowever, the quality standard approach proved insufficient for protecting Europe\u2018s polluted waters. \n\nWhen eutrophication became a major problem in the North and Baltic seas and parts of the \n\nMediterranean in the late 1980s, the EU started to focus on the sources of pollutants. This led to the \n\nDirective on Urban Wastewater Treatment (UWWT) which requires Member States to invest in \n\ninfrastructure for collecting and treating sewage in urban areas while the Nitrates Directive requires \n\nfarmers to control the amounts of nitrogen fertilisers applied to fields. And the Directive on Integrated \n\nPollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) adopted a few years later aims to minimise pollutants \n\ndischarged from large industrial installations. \n\nThe Water Framework Directive (WFD), which came into force on 22 December 2000, establishes a \n\nnew framework for the management, protection and improvement of the quality of water resources \n\nacross the European Union (EU). The WFD calls for the creation of River Basin Districts. In the case \n\nof international districts that cover the territory of more than one EU Member State the WFD requires \n\ncoordination of work in these districts.  \n\nEU Member States should aim to achieve good status in all bodies of surface water and groundwater \n\nby 2015 unless there are grounds for derogation. Only in this case achievement of good status may be \n\nextended to 2021 or by 2027 at the latest. Good status means that certain standards have been met for \n\nthe ecology, chemistry, morphology and quantity of waters. In general terms \u2017good status\u2018 means that \n\nwater only shows slight change from what would normally be expected under undisturbed conditions. \n\nThere is also a general \u2017no deterioration\u2018 provision to prevent deterioration in status. \n\nThe Water Framework Directive establishes a legal framework to protect and restore clean water in \n\nsufficient quantity across Europe. It introduces a number of generally agreed principle and concepts \n\ninto a binding regulatory instrument. In particular, it provides for: \n\n\uf0b7 Sustainable approach to manage an essential resource: It not only considers water as a \n\nvaluable ecosystem, it also recognises the economy and human health depending on it. \n\n\uf0b7 Holistic ecosystem protection: It ensures that the fresh and coastal water environment is to be \n\nprotected in its entirety. \n\n\uf0b7 Ambitious objectives, flexible means: The achievement of \u2015good status\u2016 by 2015 is ambitious \n\nand will ensure satisfying human needs, ecosystem functioning and biodiversity protection. \n\nAt the same time, the Directive provides flexibility in achieving them in the most cost \n\neffective way and introduces a possibility for priority setting in the planning. \n\n\uf0b7 The right geographical scale: The natural area for water management is the river basin \n\n(catchment area).  \n\n\uf0b7 Polluter pays principle: The introduction of water pricing policies with the element of cost \n\nrecovery and the cost-effectiveness provisions are milestones in the application of economic \n\ninstruments for the benefit of the environment.  \n\n\uf0b7 Participatory processes: WFD ensures the active participation of all businesses, farmers and \n\nother stakeholders, environment NGOs and local communities in river basin management \n\nactivities. \n\n\uf0b7 Better regulation and streamlining: The WFD and its related directives (Groundwater \n\nDaughter Directive (2006/118/EC); Floods Directive COM(2006)15) repeal 12 directives \n\nfrom the 1970s and 1980s which created a well-intended but fragmented and burdensome \n\nregulatory system. The WFD creates synergies, increases protection and streamlines efforts. \n\nImplementation of the Directive is to be achieved through the river basin management planning \n\nprocess which requires the preparation, implementation and review of a river basin management plan \n\n(RBMP) every six years for each RBD identified. This requires an approach to river basin planning \n\f\n14 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nand management that takes all relevant factors into account and considers them together. There are \n\nfive main elements of the process: \n\n\uf0b7 Governance and public participation;  \n\n\uf0b7 Characterisation of the river basin district and the pressures and impacts on the water \n\nenvironment; \n\n\uf0b7 Environmental monitoring based on river basin characterisation; \n\n\uf0b7 Setting of environmental objectives; and \n\n\uf0b7 Design and implementation of a programme of measures to achieve environmental objectives. \n\nAn important aspect of the measures are full implementation of the Urban Waste Water \n\nTreatment Directive (UWWTD) and Nitrates Directive (NiD) on reducing pollutants that \n\nreduce pollution and will improve water quality and aid, the achievement of good status under \n\nthe WFD. \n\nRBMPs are plans for protecting and improving the water environment and have been developed in \n\nconsultation with organisations and individuals. River basin planning is a gradual cyclical process that \n\ninvolves public participation throughout. RBMPs follow a series of steps shown in Fig. 1.1.The river \n\nbasin planning process started more than ten years ago with the implementation of the WFD in \n\nnational legislation and establishing the administrative structures. The next steps in 2004 were \n\nanalyses of the pressures and impacts affecting the water environment in the river basin district. The \n\nfindings were published in 2005 in the characterisation report required by Article 5 of the WFD. \n\nIn 2006 monitoring programs within the RBDs had to be established. The WFD monitoring network \n\nwill enable to identify problems and resolve them, thereby improving the water environment. The \n\nreports and consultation on Significant Water Management Issues (SWMIs) in 2007 and 2008 were \n\nimportant steps leading towards the production of the first RBMPs. \n\nThe RBMPs describe the measures that must be taken to improve the ecological quality of water \n\nbodies and help reach the objectives of the WFD. The WFD requires via the RBMPs a Programme of \n\nMeasures (PoM) to be established for each RBD. The measures implemented as part of the \n\nprogramme should enable water bodies to achieve the environmental objectives of the WFD. The \n\nPoM must be established by December 2009 and be made operational by December 2012. \n\nFigure 1.1 The WFD river basin planning process \n\n \nSource: Based on EC, 2003a. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 15 \n\n \n\nEuropean countries that are not members of the EU, have over the last years developed similar river \n\nbasin activities as introduced by the WFD in the EU Member States (Text Box 1.1) \n\nText Box 1.1 River management plans in selected non-EU countries \n\nTurkey: Basin Protection Action Plans have been prepared by the General Directorate of Water \n\nManagement with the same vision as WFD RBMPs.

However the Swiss legal \n\nsystem sets comparable targets regarding water protection and management. In contrast to the WFD, \n\nwhich is based on planning periods with specified targets, the Swiss legislation formulates binding \n\nrequirements including a set of national limits which must be met at all times. \n\nAs a member of the international commissions of the Rhine River Basin and of the Lakes of Constance, \n\nGeneva, Lugano and the Lago Maggiore, Switzerland collaborates with its neighboring states to \n\nachieve water protection goals and to implement endorsed programmes, and thus indirectly adopts \n\ncertain principles of the WFD.  \nSource: EEA, 2010a. \n\nNorway is connected to the European Union as an EFTA country, through the Agreement on the \n\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) . The WFD was formally taken into the EEA-agreement in 2009, \n\ngranting the EFTA countries extended deadlines for the implementation. \n\nThe WFD was transposed into the Norwegian Regulation on a Framework for Water Management in \n\n2007. Norway performed a voluntary implementation of the WFD in selected sub-districts across the \n\ncountry from 2007 until 2009, thus gaining the experience of River Basin Management planning. River \n\nBasin Management Plans for the selected sub-districts were adopted by the County Councils in 2009, \n\nand approved by the national Government in June of 2010. \n\nRiver Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) covering the entire country will be prepared from 2010 until \n\n2015, synchronized with the time schedule of the second cycle of implementation in the EU. \nSource: Vannportalen, 2012. \n\nSava River is the third longest and the largest by discharge tributary of the Danube River.

Data overview \n\n2.1. River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) \n\nAccording to the WFD River Basin Management Plans should since 22.12.2009 be available in all \n\nRiver Basin Districts across the EU. There are however serious delays in some parts of the EU, and in \n\nsome countries consultations are still on-going. \n\nBy May 2012, 23 EU Member States had their RBMPs adopted. Four Member States, Portugal, \n\nSpain, Greece and Belgium (the Walloon and Brussels parts) had not yet finalised the consultation of \n\nthe RBMPs and therefore had no adopted RBMPs. \n\n2.2. WISE-WFD data reporting and database \n\nMember States have in addition to the River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) reported a \n\ncomprehensive set of data related to the results of the RBMPs such as ecological status for each \n\nindividual water body or significant pressures affecting a water body. The WFD-CIS Guidance \n\nDocument No. 21 \u2015Guidance for reporting under the Water Framework Directive\u2016 (EC, 2009) \n\nprovides the specification of the data that have to be reported by Member States in relation to RBMPs. \n\n2.2.1. Status of WISE-WFD database  \n\nMost of the Member States with adopted RBMPs have reported data from the RBMPs to the WISE\nWFD database. Greece and Portugal have reported data from their RBMPs to the WISE-WFD \n\ndatabase, but do not yet have adopted RBMPs. All data reported to the WISE-WFD database by \n\nprimo May 2012 have been included into the analysis presented on ecological and chemical status \n\nand pressures. \n\nThe data reported by Member States have had a first quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) \n\nand have then been transferred into the WISE-WFD database. The EEA has been using the WISE\nWFD database version May 2012. This database contained information from 27 Member States and \n\ncovers more than 127 000 surface water bodies and 13 300 groundwater bodies.  \n\n2.2.2. Reported River Basin Districts \n\nBy May 2012 data from 161 River Basin Districts (RBDs) have been reported by Member States and \n\nincorporated into the WFD-WISE database (Table 2.1). There are still missing reporting from some \n\ncountries and RBDs. The smaller and medium size Member States generally have 1-5 RBDs, while \n\nSpain, the United Kingdom, France, Greece, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Poland and Portugal have 8 \n\nto 25 RBDs. \n\n \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 17 \n\nTable 2.1 Overview of reported RBDs per Member State  \n\nMember States RBDs Member States RBDs \n\nAustria 3 Latvia 4 \n\nBelgium Flanders 2 Lithuania 4 \n\nBulgaria 4 Luxembourg 2 \n\nCyprus 1 Malta 1 \n\nCzech Rep. 3 Netherlands 4 \n\nDenmark 4 Poland 10 \n\nEstonia 3 Portugal 10 \n\nFinland 8 Romania 1 \n\nFrance 13 Slovenia 2 \n\nGermany 10 Slovak Rep. 2 \n\nGreece 14 Spain 15 \n\nHungary 1 Sweden 10 \n\nIreland 7 United Kingdom 15 \n\nItaly 8   \n\nTotal reported RBDS 161 \n\nNote: Missing countries and (RBDs) Belgium: Wallonia & Brussels (6); Spain (9) and Norway (9). \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012.

EEA WISE-SoE data collection \n\nThe EEA base its water quality data on a representative sub-sample of national monitoring results, \n\nwhich EEA member countries report voluntarily each year to the EEA. The EEA has mainly collected \n\nannual values (e.g. average, median, minimum and maximum) but in some cases the EEA also have \n\ncollected seasonal (summer and winter) values. In the context of the implementation of the WFD the \n\nannual data flow for water quality has been transferred into the WISE \u2017State of the Environment\u2018 \n\n(SoE) voluntary data flow (WISE-SoE). With this the WISE-SoE data flow remains one of the \n\nEIONET Priority Data Flows, but gains full integration into the reporting under WISE and \n\ncomplementarity with data collected under the WFD. \n\nData are transferred on an annual basis from the countries to the EEA and are stored in Waterbase. \n\nAt the end of 2011, Waterbase contained water quality information on  \n\n\uf0b7 more than 10 000 river stations in 37 countries,  \n\n\uf0b7 more than 3500 lake stations in 35 countries,  \n\n\uf0b7 more than 5000 coastal stations in 28 countries, and \n\n\uf0b7 quality data from around 1500 groundwater bodies. \n\nSome of the water quality data are from countries not reporting under the WFD (e.g Switzerland). The \n\ndifferent Waterbase datasets are available through the following Website \n\nhttp://www.eea.europa.eu//themes/water/dc.  \n\nThe data reported in the WISE-WFD and the WISE-SoE databases should make it possible to \n\ncompare the water quality data with the data on ecological and chemical status and pressure \n\ninformation for the individual water bodies. There have been several obstacles for making this match \n\nbetween the two databases inter alia due to Member States\u2018 reporting different water body \n\nidentifications in the two reporting streams. However, for water bodies with matching IDs in the two \n\ndatabases, analyses and assessments linking ecological status and water quality have been done and \n\nare presented in chapter 7.  \n\n2.4. Water bodies \n\nThe WFD requires that waters within each river basin district be differentiated into water categories: \n\ngroundwater, rivers, lakes, transitional waters and coastal waters. These waters are then further sub\ndivided depending on their type, based on natural factors (such as altitude, longitude, geology and \n\nsize) that might influence ecological communities. This division forms the basis of water bodies. \n\nWater bodies are the basic management units for reporting and assessing compliance with the WFDs \n\nenvironmental objectives. \n\nThe EU Member States now have reported 13 300 groundwater bodies and more than 127 000 surface \n\nwater bodies: 80% of them rivers, 15% lakes and 5% coastal and transitional waters (Table 2.5). All \n\nMember States have reported groundwater bodies; 26 Member States, all reporting Member States \n\nexcept Malta have reported river water bodies, 24 Member States have reported lake water bodies, \n\nand 16 and 22 Member States have reported transitional and coastal water bodies, respectively.\n\nhttp://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/dc\f\n20 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nTable 2.5 Number of Member States, RBDs, water bodies, and length or area, per \nwater category \n\nCategory Member \n\nStates \n\nRBDs Number of \n\nwater bodies \n\nTotal length  \n\nor area \n\nAverage \n\nlength/area \n\nRivers 26 157 104 311 1.17 million km 11.3 km \n\nLakes 24 144 19 053 88 000 km\n2\n 4.6 km\n\n2\n \n\nTransitional 16 87 1010 19 600 km\n2\n 19 km\n\n2\n \n\nCoastal waters 22 114 3033 358 000 km\n2\n 118 km\n\n2\n \n\nGroundwater 27 148 13 261 3.8 million km\n2\n 309 km\n\n2\n (*) \n\nNote: (*) Based on 127 RBDs with reported areas of groundwater bodies.  \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012.

Five \n\ncountries, Denmark, Sweden, France, UK and Germany, reported 60% of the river water bodies, \n\nwhile three countries, France, Germany, Poland and the UK accounted for nearly half of the river \n\nlength (Table 2.6). \n\nThe average size of the more than 104 000 reported river water bodies is 11.3 km long.

Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden had relatively small river water bodies with \n\nan average length less than 5 km and less than half the EU average. If a Member State reports \n\nrelatively large river water bodies for example it may have several river water bodies longer than \n\n50 km, it may be difficult to characterize the status (e.g. sections of the water body may have \n\na different status). \n\nMember States like Denmark, Ireland and Austria have a three to four times higher density of river \n\nwater bodies than the EU average of around 23 river water bodies per 1000 km\n2\n of the Member State \n\nterritory. Five countries have a relative higher river length (length per 1000 km\n2\n) than the EU average. \n\nSome countries like Latvia, Finland, The Netherlands, Greece and Spain have a lower density of river \n\nwater bodies per km\n2\n and river length per km\n\n2\n than the EU average. If a Member State has a low \n\ncoverage of the rivers in a country, the characterization of status and pressures may not be fully \n\nrepresentative for the rivers in the Member State. \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_SIZE_AVERAGE\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 21 \n\nTable 2.6 Number of RBDs, surface water bodies, and river lengths, area of lakes, \ntransitional and coastal waters per country \n\nCountry \n\nRivers Lakes Transitional Coastal Total \n\nNb \nAvg \n\nL \nTotal L Nb \n\nAvg \n\nA \n\nTotal \n\nA \nNb \n\nAvg \n\nA \n\nTotal \n\nA \nNb \n\nAvg \n\nA \nTotalA Nb \n\nAustria 7339 4 31392 62 15 934 0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n7401 \n\nBelgium \nFlanders \n\n177 14 2472 18 2 40 6 7 42 2 715 1429 202 \n\nBulgaria 688 37 25568 43 2 75 15 7 109 13 110 1428 759 \n\nCyprus 216 12 2579 18 2 28 0 \n  \n\n26 33 865 255 \n\nCzech Rep. 1069 17 18596 71 4 249 0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n1140 \n\nDenmark 16881 1 12047 940 0 462 0 \n  \n\n162 252 40875 17983 \n\nEstonia 645 19 12106 89 22 1966 0 \n  \n\n16 906 14501 750 \n\nFinland 1602 18 28875 4275 7 28172 0 \n  \n\n276 115 32570 6078 \n\nFrance 10824 22 241684 439 4 1964 96 30 2840 164 163 26652 11523 \n\nGermany 9072 14 126158 712 3 2399 5 163 814 74 309 22843 9863 \n\nGreece 1033 11 11480 29 31 889 29 39 1129 233 165 38390 1324 \n\nHungary 869 22 18802 213 6 1267 0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n1082 \n\nIreland 4565 5 21037 807 3 2628 190 6 1068 111 119 13183 5673 \n\nItaly 7644 10 78813 300 7 2158 181 7 1235 489 39 18930 8614 \n\nLatvia 204 38 7751 259 3 825 1 934 934 6 214 1283 470 \n\nLithuania 832 17 14251 345 2 809 4 129 515 2 57 115 1182 \n\nLuxembourg 102 0 \n \n\n0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n102 \n\nMalta no rivers \n        \n\n9 395 3555 9 \n\nNetherlands 254 19 4756 450 7 3046 5 137 684 15 793 11889 724 \n\nPoland 4586 24 111483 1038 2 2293 9 215 1936 10 67 666 5643 \n\nPortugal 1611 35 55725 122 6 742 53 15 813 57 275 15690 1843 \n\nRomania 3262 23 74473 131 8 993 2 391 781 4 143 572 3399 \n\nSlovak Rep. 1760 11 18944 0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n0 \n  \n\n1760 \n\nSlovenia 135 19 2620 14 3 38 0 \n  \n\n6 67 404 155 \n\nSpain 4298 17 74834 327 16 5281 201 14 2848 186 84 15624 5012 \n\nSweden 15563 5 79466 7232 4 29192 21 9 180 602 58 34623 23418 \n\nUnited \n\nKingdom \n9080 11 99749 1119 2 1933 192 19 3716 570 111 63399 10961 \n\nEU 104311 11.3 1175000 19053 4.6 88000 1010 19 19600 3033 118 350 000 127325 \n\nNote: Nb: number of water bodies; Average (Avg) and total L (length) of river water bodies in km; Average (Avg) \n\nand total A (area) of lakes, transitional and coastal water bodies in km\n2\n. \n\nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_SIZE_AVERAGE. \n\n2.4.2. Lake water bodies \n\nThere are more than 500 000 natural lakes larger than 0.01 km\n2\n (1 ha) in Europe (EEA 1995). About \n\n80% to 90% of these are small with a surface area of between 0.01 and 0.1 km\n2\n, whereas around \n\n16 000 have a surface area exceeding 1 km\n2\n. Twenty four European lakes have a surface area larger \n\nthan 400 km\n2\n.  \n\nMany natural European lakes appeared 10 000 to 15 000 years ago; when the ice sheet covered all of \n\nnorthern Europe. In central and southern Europe ice sheets only stretched as far as mountain ranges. \n\nAs a rule, the regions comprising many natural lakes were affected by the Weichsel ice. For example, \n\ncountries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland have numerous lakes that account for approximately 5% \n\nto 10% of their national surface area. In central Europe, most natural lakes lie in mountain regions. \n\nLakes at high altitude are relatively small whereas those in valleys are larger, for example Lac L\u00e9man, \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_SIZE_AVERAGE\f\n22 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nBodensee, and Lago Maggiore in the Alps. European countries which were only partially affected by \n\nthe glaciation period (Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, southern England, central Germany, the \n\nCzech Republic, and the Slovak Republic) have few natural lakes. In these areas man-made lakes such \n\nas reservoirs and ponds are often more common than natural lakes.  \n\nLakes are often split into two main types (shallow and deep lakes) as they tend to have different \n\nsensitivities to pressures such as water pollution. High quality shallow lakes are characterised by \n\nhealthy submerged plant communities and associated diverse communities of invertebrates, fish and \n\nwetland birds. Phytoplankton is also present but typically in low levels. Naturally characterised by \n\nclear water, these systems have frequently shifted into turbid, phytoplankton-dominated states lacking \n\nmacrophytes, primarily caused by nutrient pollution (eutrophication). Deep lakes are mainly found in \n\nmountainous regions and under natural conditions they are characterised by very low nutrient loads. \n\nMacrophytes are restricted to a narrow belt along the shores and phytoplankton abundance is low. \n\nEutrophication in deep lakes causes enhanced primary production by phytoplankton, in severe cases \n\nalgal blooms and oxygen depletion (particularly in the deep zones) may affect all processes and \n\nspecies. \n\nTwenty-four Member States have reported lakes, no lakes have been reported from Malta, \n\nLuxembourg and Slovakia. In total around 18 000 lake water bodies with a total area greater than \n\n88 000 km\n2\n has been reported by Member States. Two countries, Sweden, and Finland, reported more \n\nthan 60% of the lake water bodies and two-thirds of lake area. \n\nCategory \nMember \n\nStates \nRBDs \n\nNumber of \n\nwater bodies \nLength or area Average area \n\nLakes 24 144 19 053 88 000 km\n2\n 4.6 km\n\n2\n \n\nThe average area of the more than 19 000 reported lake water bodies is 4.6 km\n2\n \u2013 the average size is \n\nmarkedly influenced by the very large lakes. Four Member States (Austria, Estonia, Greece and \n\nSpain) have average size of lake water bodies greater than 10 km\n2\n. \n\nHalf of the reported lakes are less than 1 km\n2\n in area and more than 87% of the reported lake water \n\nbodies have an area less than 5 km\n2\n (Table 2.7). Only 78 of the reported lake water bodies have an \n\narea greater than 150 km\n2\n; Finland and Sweden have reported 28 and 16 lake water bodies greater \n\nthan 150 km\n2\n, and Lithuania and Spain reported 9 and 8 large lake water bodies. \n\nTable 2.7 Number of lake water bodies according to size of water bodies \n\n \nArea of lakes in km\n\n2\n \n\n \n<0.5 0.5-1 1-5 5-25 25-150 > 150 \n\nNumber of lake \n\nwater bodies \n4249 4300 6693 1745 388 78 \n\nPercentage 24 % 25 % 38 % 10 % 2.2% 0.4% \n\nSome Member States (e.g. Sweden and Finland) have divided their large lakes into several water \n\nbodies, while other Member States (e.g. Austria) only have one water body for each of their lakes. \n\n2.4.3. Transitional water bodies \n\nTransitional waters are those waters between the land and the sea and include fjords, estuaries, \n\nlagoons, deltas and rias. They often encompass river mouths and show the transition from freshwater \n\nto marine conditions. Depending on the tidal influence from coastal waters, but also on the freshwater \n\ninfluence from upstream, transitional waters are often characterised by frequently changing salinity. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 23 \n\nTransitional waters are the sites of major cities and harbours (ports) and these waters historically have \n\nbeen degraded by port activities, by pollution from urban, industrial and agricultural areas, and by \n\nland claim for sea defences, building and agriculture. \n\nSixteen Member States reported from 87 RBDs transitional water bodies. In total 1010 transitional \n\nwater bodies with an area greater than 19 000 km\n2\n has been reported by Member States. Five \n\ncountries; United Kingdom, Spain, France. Italy and Ireland; reported more than 90% of the \n\ntransitional water bodies and more than 70% of the transitional waters area. \n\nCategory Member \n\nStates \n\nRBDs Number of \n\nwater bodies \n\nTotal area Average area \n\nTransitional 16 87 1010 19 600 km\n2\n 19 km\n\n2\n \n\nThe average size/area of the reported transitional water bodies is 19 km\n2\n. The average size of the \n\ntransitional water bodies is greater than 100 km\n2\n in five Member States (Table 2.6). \n\n2.4.4. Coastal waters \n\nCoastal waters represent the interface between land and ocean, and in the context of the Water \n\nFramework Directive coastal waters include water, that has not been designated as transitional water, \n\nextending one nautical mile from a baseline defined by the land points where territorial waters are \n\nmeasured. \n\nAll European coastal waters have, to a varying degree, been affected by eutrophication and this has \n\nled to nuisance and toxic algal blooms, loss of benthic habitats by shading out benthic vegetation and \n\neradication of benthic fauna due to oxygen depletion as well as fish kills.  \n\nTwenty-two Member States reported more than 3000 coastal water bodies from 114 RBDs. The total \n\narea of the reported coastal waters is more than 350 000 km\n2\n. The average area of the reported coastal \n\nwater bodies is 118 km\n2\n.

Heavily modified and artificial water bodies \n\nThe WFD allows Member States to designate some of their surface waters as heavily modified water \n\nbodies (HMWB) or artificial water bodies (AWB). Member States will need to meet the good \n\necological potential (GEP) criterion for ecosystems of HMWBs and AWBs rather than good \n\necological status as for natural type water bodies. The objective of GEP is similar to good status but \n\ntakes into account the constraints imposed by social and/or economic uses. \n\nIn many river basins, the upper stretches in mountain, highland and often forested areas remain \n\nlargely in their natural state, but the lower stretches often passing large cities are modified by \n\nembankments and other public works and they are designated as heavily modified waters. Other \n\nexamples of heavily modified water bodies are inland waterways, reservoirs on rivers, or lakes with \n\nheavy water level regulation and impounded river reaches. Heavily modified transitional and coastal \n\nwaters have often been altered by dredging or land reclamation due to urban, transport and \n\nagricultural developments. Artificial water bodies can be, for example, canals or open-cast mining \n\nlakes. \n\nOverall 16.4% of European water bodies have during the first RBMPs been designated as HMWBs or \n\nAWBs (16.7% of rivers, 15.7% of lakes, 25.4% of transitional waters and 6.4% of coastal waters \u2013 \n\nFig. 2.1). This is probably a minimum estimate as some Member States indicate that the designation \n\nprocess has not been completed. Two Member States, Denmark and Italy, have reported most of the \n\nwater bodies to be of an unknown natural, HMWB or AWB status. \n\nMore than 6% of the lake (reservoirs) and around 4% of river (canals and reservoirs) water bodies \n\nhave been identified as artificial; while only a few of the transitional and coastal waters are listed as \n\nbeing AWBs.  \n\nFigure 2.1 Percentage of natural, heavily modified (HM), artificial (A) and unknown \nstatus for river, lake, transitional and coastal water bodies (WBs)  \n\n \nNotes: See EEA technical report for more details on HMWBs and AWBs (EEA ETC/ICM, 2012). All water bodies \n\nare included. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_HMWB_AWB.  \n\nThe countries (and RBDs) with the highest percentage (more than 50%) of HMWBs and AWBs for \n\nrivers are the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary and Germany, while countries such as Finland, France, \n\nSlovakia, Sweden and Ireland designated only 5% or less of their river water bodies in these two types \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_HMWB_AWB\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 25 \n\n(Map 2.1). In the case of lakes the highest percentage (above 60%) of designated HMWBs or AWBs \n\nare in Belgium, The Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Bulgaria, France, The United Kingdom, \n\nHungary and Italy. The lower end of such rank (less than 5%) is represented by Sweden, Estonia, \n\nLatvia, Ireland and Finland. \n\nHeavily modified and artificial water bodies are clearly associated with densely populated, urbanised \n\nareas with industrial areas and ports. In mountainous regions a high proportion of HMWBs can be \n\nfound in RBMPs with many reservoirs and much water storage for hydropower and irrigation. The \n\ncoastal zones of the North Sea have a high proportion of designated coastal and in particular \n\ntransitional HMWBs and AWBs. \n\nMap 2.1 Proportion of heavily modified and artificial water bodies for rivers and lakes \n\nand transitional and coastal waters \n\n \nNotes: See EEA technical report for more details on HMWBs and AWBs (EEA ETC/ICM, 2012).

Methodology \n\n3.1. WFD principles for classification of ecological status and potential \n\n3.1.1. Principles for classification of ecological status in natural water bodies \n\nThe WFD defines \u2015good ecological status\u2016 in terms of a healthy ecosystem based upon classification \n\nof the biological elements (phytoplankton, phytobenthos, benthic fauna and fish) and supporting \n\nhydromorphological, physico-chemical quality elements and non-priority pollutants. Biological \n\nelements are especially important, since they reflect the quality of water and disturbance of \n\nenvironment over longer period of time. The ecological status is reported for each water body. Water \n\nbodies are classified by assessment systems developed for the different water categories (river, lake, \n\ntransitional and coastal waters) and the different natural types within each water category.  \n\nThe ecological status classification scheme includes five status classes: high, good, moderate, poor \n\nand bad. \u2017High status\u2018 is defined as the biological, chemical and morphological conditions associated \n\nwith no or very low human pressure. This is also called the \u2017reference condition\u2018 as it is the best status \n\nachievable - the benchmark. These reference conditions are type-specific, so they are different for \n\ndifferent types of rivers, lakes or coastal waters in order to take into account the broad variation of \n\necological conditions in Europe. For a water body to be classified as having \u2017good\u2018 ecological status, \n\nnone of the biological or physico-chemical quality elements can be more than slightly altered from \n\ntheir reference conditions. For water bodies in \u2017moderate\u2018 status, one or more of the biological \n\nelements may be moderately altered. In \u2017poor\u2018 status, the alterations to one or more biological quality \n\nelements are major and, in \u2017bad\u2018 status, there are severe alterations such that a large proportion of the \n\nreference biological community is absent.  \n\nFigure 3.1 Classification of ecological status \n\n \n\nSource: EC, 2005a. \n\nBiological quality elements \n\nThe biological quality elements required for assessment of ecological status (WFD Annex V) are: \n\n\uf0b7 Rivers and Lakes: Phytoplankton, phytobenthos, macrophytes, benthic fauna, fish \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 27 \n\n\uf0b7 Transitional and Coastal waters: Phytoplankton, macroalgae, angiosperms, benthic fauna, fish \n\n(fish only in transitional waters) \nThe WFD requires that standardised methods are used for the monitoring of the quality elements, and \n\nthat the good status class boundaries for each biological quality element are intercalibrated across \n\nMember States sharing similar types of water bodies. Further information on the intercalibration \n\nprocess and results are given in Text Box 3.1 below. \n\nText Box 3.1 Intercalibration of national classification systems for assessment of \necological status  \n\nThe WFD requires that the national classification systems for assessing ecological status for all the \n\nrequired biological quality elements (BQEs) should be intercalibrated. The aim of the intercalibration \n\nis to ensure that the good status class boundaries given by each country\u2018s biological methods are \n\ncomparable and WFD compliant relative to the normative definitions in Annex V. Through the \n\nintercalibration process, the national classification systems should be adjusted to ensure that the good \n\nstatus boundaries are set at the same distance from reference conditions for each biological quality \n\nelement in all Member States sharing the same type of water bodies. The first phase of intercalibration \n\nwas completed by the end of 2007. Due to delays in the development of the national systems in many \n\nMember States, the results from this first phase do not cover all the BQEs required and provide only \n\npartial results for others. The delays were most severe for transitional waters, which were not even \n\nincluded in the first phase of the intercalibration process, but there were also major gaps for coastal \n\nwaters, as well as for lakes. For rivers, most Member States had developed assessment systems for at \n\nleast two BQEs (macroinvertebrates and diatom phytobenthos) in time for the first phase of the \n\nintercalibration, although some of these methods may not fulfil all the WFD requirements. The \n\ncomparability across Member States of the ecological status reported in these first RBMPs is therefore \n\nquite uncertain for several BQEs. For more information on the first Official Decision of the \n\nIntercalibration exercise and the Technical Annexes to this Decision for Rivers, Lakes and Coastal \n\nWaters, see EC (2008b).  \n\nTo fill the gaps from phase 1 and improve comparability, the 2nd phase of Intercalibration took place \n\nfrom 2008 to 2011. These last results are not incorporated in the first River Basin Management Plans, \n\nbut are to be included in the second cycle of reporting in 2015. The results have been peer reviewed as \n\na basis for formal adoption of the results in 2012.  \n\nChemical and physico-chemical quality elements \n\nThe general chemical and physico-chemical quality elements describe water quality and are \n\nconsidered as supporting elements to biological communities. General chemical and physico-chemical \n\nquality elements relevant for rivers and lakes are transitional and coastal waters are (i) transparency \n\n(not for rivers), (ii) thermal conditions, (iii) oxygenation conditions, (iv) nutrient conditions and (v) \n\nacidifying substances (for rivers and lakes only). In a high ecological status, the condition of each \n\nelement must be within the range of conditions normally associated with undisturbed conditions. \n\nWithin a good ecological status, the Directive requires that the general physico-chemical quality \n\nelements comply with standards established by the Member State to protect the functioning of the \n\necosystem and the achievement of the values specified for the biological quality elements as in a good \n\nstatus rating. \n\nSpecific pollutants \n\nMember States are required to identify 'specific pollutants' (i.e. those pollutants being discharged in \n\nsignificant quantities) from the Directive's general list of the main types of pollutants. For good \n\necological status, the environmental quality standards established for specific pollutants must not be \n\nexceeded. Environmental quality standards for the specific pollutants have been set in such a way that, \n\nwhere the standards are met, no adverse effects on aquatic plants and animals should occur. \n\f\n28 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nHydromorphological quality elements \n\nFor high status to be achieved, WFD requires that there are no more than very minor human \n\nalterations to the hydromorphological quality elements. At good, moderate, poor and bad status, the \n\nrequired values for the hydromorphological quality elements must be such as to support the required \n\nbiological quality element values for the relevant class. Each of the four surface water categories is \n\nascribed specific hydromorphological quality elements (Table 3.1). \n\nTable 3.1 Hydromorphological quality elements to be used for the assessment of \necological status or potential based on the list in WFD Annex V. 1.1 \n\nMorphological conditions \nRivers \n\n\uf0b7 river depth and width variation \n\n\uf0b7 structure and substrate of the river bed \n\n\uf0b7 structure of the riparian zone  \n\nLakes  \n\n\uf0b7 lake depth variation \n\n\uf0b7 quantity, structure and substrate of the lake bed \n\n\uf0b7 structure of the lake shore \n\nTransitional waters \n\n\uf0b7 depth variation \n\n\uf0b7 quantity, structure and substrate of the bed \n\n\uf0b7 structure of the intertidal zone \n\nCoastal waters \n\n\uf0b7 depth variation \n\n\uf0b7 structure and substrate of the coastal bed \n\n\uf0b7 structure of the intertidal zone \n\nHydrological regime \nRivers \n\n\uf0b7 quantify and dynamics of water flow \n\n\uf0b7 connection to ground water bodies \n\nLakes \n\n\uf0b7 quantify and dynamics of water flow \n\n\uf0b7 residence time \n\n\uf0b7 connection to the groundwater body \n\nTransitional waters \n\n\uf0b7 freshwater flow \n\n\uf0b7 wave exposure \n\nCoastal waters \n\n\uf0b7 direction of dominant currents \n\n\uf0b7 wave exposure \n\n \n\nCombination of quality elements to overall ecological status of a water body \n\nThe WFD requires that the overall ecological status of a water body be determined by the results for \n\nthe biological or physicochemical quality element with the worst class determined by any of the \n\nbiological quality elements. This is called the \u2015one out - all out\u201d principle. The rationale of this \n\nprinciple is to avoid averaging the impacts on different quality elements due to different pressures and \n\ntherefore overlook some significant pressures, and also to provide sufficient protection of the most \n\nsensitive quality element to a significant pressure.  \n\nThe process of ecological classification is described in Fig. 3.1. \n\n3.1.2. Principles for classification of ecological potential for artificial and heavily modified \n\nwater bodies \n\nThe WFD has different requirements for natural waters and for artificial or heavily modified waters. \n\nThe artificial and heavily modified water bodies should be designated according to conditions \n\nestablished in WFD article 4.3). For water bodies that have been designated as heavily modified or \n\nartificial the ecological potential (GEP) should be determined. The objective of GEP is similar to \n\ngood status but takes into account the constraints imposed by social and/or economic uses. Ecological \n\npotential for HMWBs and AWBs is either based on the same QEs as for ecological status after \n\nadjusting for the impacts of the hydromorphological pressures underlying the designation of the water \n\nbody as being heavily modified or artificial, or on the level of measures taken to mitigate the impacts \n\nof all other pressures on those water bodies.  \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 29 \n\n3.2. Ecological status classification in RBMPs: Confidence and data quality \n\n3.2.1. European overview of quality elements monitored \n\nDue to delays in the development of national classification systems in many Member States, only a \n\nfew biological quality elements could be used for assessing ecological status of water bodies for the \n\nfirst RBMPs. The assessment systems available at the time of delivering the RBMPs were mainly for \n\nbenthic invertebrates in rivers and coastal waters, for diatoms in rivers and for phytoplankton \n\nchlorophyll a in lakes. Most of the assessment systems are relevant mainly to assess impacts of \n\npollution pressures causing nutrient and organic enrichment, whereas hydromorphological pressures \n\ncausing altered habitats have mainly been assessed in rivers using fish as an indicator of ecological \n\nstatus. For transitional waters there were almost no assessment systems available in time to be used in \n\nthe first RBMPs. There were also large differences in the level of development of assessment methods \n\nacross Europe, with the most serious gaps found in the Mediterranean and Eastern Continental / Black \n\nSea regions. For more information, see EC (2008b).  \n\nAn additional weakness in the national systems used for ecological status assessment of water bodies \n\nin the first RBMPs is that the class boundaries for the supporting quality elements (e.g. nutrients, \n\norganic matter etc.) in many cases are not well linked to the class boundaries for the biological quality \n\nelements, and in some cases may be quite relaxed compared to the responses of the biological quality \n\nelements (Claussen and Arle, 2012).  \n\nFor ecological potential of heavily modified and artificial water bodies, the assessment systems \n\napplied have either been the same as those for ecological status (for example in terms of \n\nphytoplankton chlorophyll in Mediterranean reservoirs or fish in Alpine rivers), been adjusted to \n\naccount for the heavy hydromorphological impacts on the biological quality elements in the heavily \n\nmodified and artificial water bodies (for example benthic fauna in Danish rivers) or been based on \n\nexpert judgement considering possible measures that could be used to improve the ecological \n\npotential. \n\nThe overview of quality elements monitored for classification of the ecological status or potential \n\n(Fig. 3.2) reflects the level of development and implementation of the national monitoring and \n\nclassification systems described above. The proportion of water bodies monitored for the different \n\nQEs is quite small in relation to the total number of water bodies, although several countries monitor a \n\nconsiderably higher proportion of their water bodies than the EU average level shown in Fig. 3.2. The \n\nsmall proportion monitored at EU level indicates that the majority of water bodies have been \n\nclassified by grouping, using a few representative monitored water bodies to classify a larger group of \n\nnon-monitored water bodies. This grouping has been done to a larger extent for Member States with a \n\nhigh number of water bodies than for those with low number of water bodies. If this grouping is \n\napplied to water bodies of the same type exposed to the same type and level of pressures, the \n\nclassification of non-monitored water bodies would still be WFD compliant, according to the WFD \n\nCIS guidance on monitoring.  \n\nAnother reason for the low proportion of quality elements monitored is that many water bodies have \n\nbeen assessed using expert judgement based on the information compiled in the pressure and impact \n\nanalyses (WFD article 5) in this first cycle of RBMPs. In many cases this was the only solution, due \n\nto gaps in the classification system, and probably also incomplete implementation of the WFD \n\nmonitoring systems.  \n\nRiver water bodies are monitored for the different quality elements in less than 25% of all water \n\nbodies, illustrating the practice of grouping and/or expert judgement for classifying non-monitored \n\nwater bodies. This grouping is justified by the very large number of river water bodies in many \n\nMember States. At EU level, the most commonly monitored quality elements are macroinvertebrates \n\n(22%), as well as the supporting quality elements for hydromorphology (21%) and for general \n\nphysico-chemical quality (23%). Benthic flora and fish, as well as non-priority specific pollutants are \n\f\n30 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nmonitored in 16-18% of the total number of river water bodies, while phytoplankton is rarely \n\nmonitored as a basis for classification of ecological status in rivers. Although the proportions are low, \n\nthe absolute number of European rivers being monitored with biological quality elements is still \n\nsubstantial, ranging from 23 000 for benthic invertebrates, 19 000 for benthic flora to 17 000 for fish.  \n\nFor lakes, phytoplankton and general physico-chemical quality elements are the most commonly \n\nmonitored quality elements, but are only reported to be monitored in ca. 22% of all water bodies. In \n\nmany cases the phytoplankton monitoring is based only on chlorophyll a, which was the only part of \n\nthis quality element that was fully developed for classification by most Member States for the first \n\nRBMPs. The other biological quality elements, fish, benthic flora and benthic invertebrates are \n\nmonitored only in respectively 10%, 16% and 18% of the water bodies. Thus, the classification of \n\nlakes is also based on grouping and/or expert judgement for the majority of the classified water \n\nbodies. The proportions correspond to between 1800 and 4000 lakes being monitored with biological \n\nquality elements for classification of ecological status across Europe. \n\nFigure 3.2 European overview of the different quality elements monitored as \npercentage of total number of water bodies \n\nRivers Lakes \n\n  \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 31 \n\nTransitional waters Coastal waters \n\n  \n\nNotes: (*) Benthic flora means benthic algae, macrophytes or other aquatic flora for rivers and lakes, and \n\nmacroalgae, angiosperms or other aquatic flora for transitional and coastal waters.  \nQuality Elements monitored is based on data reported at station level or at subprogramme level by each Member \nState, using stations data for all Member States having reported QEs at this level (except EE where subprogramme level was chosen because EE reported only station level for one RBD, but subprogramme level for all \nRBDs) and subprogramme level for Member States not reporting QEs at station level, but only at subprogramme \nlevel (DK, HU, IE, LT, LV, PL, SK).The percentage for each QE is calculated against the total number of water \nbodies (=100%) for each Member State summarised for all Member States, i.e. total number of water bodies \nreported where quality elements were identified are for rivers: 104311, for lakes: 18015, for transitional waters: \n1001, for coastal waters: 2998. \u201cMonitored\u201d means water bodies with at least one monitoring station for that \nparticular QE.  \nSource: WISE-WFD database, June 2012. \n\nFor transitional waters, the picture is different from that for rivers and lakes. A larger proportion of \n\nwater bodies is reported to be monitored, and the most commonly monitored quality elements are the \n\nsupporting elements (hydromorphological and physico-chemical), which are monitored in ca. 45% of \n\nthe total number of water bodies. Also the non-priority specific pollutants are commonly monitored \n\n(ca. 37%), while the most commonly used biological quality element is phytoplankton, for which 38% \n\nof the water bodies are monitored. The other biological quality elements are monitored in ca. one third \n\nof all water bodies. The reason why the proportion monitored water bodies in transitional waters is \n\nhigher than for in rivers and lakes is probably related to the much lower total number of transitional \n\nwater bodies. They may also be less comparable in terms of types and pressures, thus grouping and \n\nexpert judgement is less needed and also more difficult to apply for classifying the transitional waters.  \n\nFor coastal waters, phytoplankton (probably mainly chlorophyll a), macroinvertebrates and general \n\nphysico-chemical quality elements are most commonly monitored, corresponding to ca. 30% of all \n\ncoastal water bodies. These quality elements have also been traditionally monitored in coastal waters \n\nto assess nutrient- and organic enrichment (and secondary impacts of nutrient enrichment). The other \n\nmajor quality elements are monitored in ca. 20% of the classified water bodies. Thus, the \n\nclassification of coastal waters is also based on grouping and/or expert judgement to a large extent.  \n\f\n32 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\n3.2.2. Confidence in classification of ecological status or potential in different countries \n\nMost Member States have classified all their water bodies (Fig. 3.3), although some countries have a \n\nsubstantial proportion of water bodies that are delineated, but not classified. At the EU level 86% of a \n\ntotal of 123215 river and lake water bodies are classified, while 77% of a total of 4037 transitional \n\nand coastal water bodies are classified. The Member States with a substantial proportion of \n\nunclassified water bodies for rivers and lakes are Poland (79%), Finland (54%), Italy (48%), Hungary \n\n(39%) and Greece (38%). For transitional and coastal waters the countries with a substantial \n\nproportion of unclassified water bodies are Italy (90%), Poland (60%), Denmark (49%), Ireland \n\n(39%).  \n\nThe reasons for not classifying all water bodies are unclear, but may be related to low confidence or \n\ngaps in assessment systems for certain quality elements or certain types of water bodies. The WFD \n\nallows grouping of water bodies for classification, meaning that water bodies can be classified based \n\non monitoring data from other water bodies that are of the same type and exposed to the same level \n\nand type of pressures. Grouping has been extensively applied by many Member States in the first \n\nRBMPs, but it is unclear what level of confidence has been chosen for grouped water bodies. It is also \n\nunclear which quality elements are reported to be used as basis for classification for grouped water \n\nbodies that are not monitored.  \n\nFor Poland the reason for not classifying all water bodies is that only monitored water bodies have \n\nbeen classified (i.e. no extrapolation/grouping and no expert judgement has been used). This is also \n\nwhy Poland report high confidence for all the classified water bodies (see also Fig. 3.6). For Finland \n\nmost monitoring effort in the first RBMP was focused on water bodies exposed to significant \n\npressures, so most of the unclassified water bodies are in near pristine condition, representing sparsely \n\npopulated areas without significant pressures.  \n\nMember States have reported the confidence of classification as high, medium or low, but the basis \n\nfor choosing these confidence categories is not harmonised across the EU. However, from the \n\ndescriptions reported by the Member States on how these categories have been used, there are some \n\ngeneral principles applied by many Member States: \n\n\u2022 high confidence: classification based on monitoring of at least one biological quality element \n\nand some supporting quality elements, as well as other criteria, such as using intercalibrated methods, \n\ndata based on a high number of samples, water bodies with EQRs not too close to class boundaries.  \n\n\u2022 medium confidence: classification based on monitoring of at least one supporting quality \n\nelement, or when failing one of the other criteria needed to report high confidence \n\n\u2022 low confidence: classification is done without monitoring data, based on expert judgement, or \n\nwhen failing all the other criteria required for high confidence \n\nFor some water bodies no information of confidence is reported. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 33 \n\nFigure 3.3 Proportion of classified water bodies of the total number of water bodies \nfor rivers and lakes (left) and for transitional and coastal waters (right) \n\nRivers and lakes Transitional and coastal waters \n\n  \nNotes: The Member States are ranked by the percentage of classified water bodies. The total number of water \n\nbodies is given in brackets for each Member State. The total number of water bodies does not include water \nbodies in Member States/RBDs for which there is no reporting (see table 2.1). \u201cClassified\u201d means water bodies \nwith status class bad to high. \u201cUnclassified\u201d means water bodies with status class \u201cUnknown\u201d or \u201cNot applicable\u201d. \nFor Finland, the number of water bodies includes the Aaland RBD. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS. \n\nThe confidence in classification reported in the RBMPs is generally low (Fig. 3.4). For rivers and \n\nlakes only one third of the classified water bodies at the EU level have been classified with medium or \n\nhigh confidence. For transitional and coastal water the confidence in classification at the EU level is \n\nreported as medium or high for half of the classified water bodies. For all water categories this \n\ncorresponds roughly to the proportion of water bodies monitored with at least one biological quality \n\nelement (Fig. 3.4). The difference between the Member States on the confidence reported is large, \n\nranging from high confidence for all classified water bodies to low or no information on confidence.  \n\nPoland has reported high confidence for all their classified water bodies, whereas they have only \n\nclassified 21% of their water bodies in rivers and lakes and 40% in transitional and coastal waters. \n\nThis is because Poland has only classified a water body if they have high confidence in the \n\nclassification (see further information related to Fig. 3.3 above). Some Member States have not \n\nprovided information on confidence for all or almost all of their classified water bodies, e.g. the \n\nNetherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Denmark (the latter mainly for rivers).  \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\n34 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nFigure 3.4 Member States own assessment of confidence in classification of \necological status or potential of rivers and lakes (left) and transitional and \ncoastal waters (right) \n\nRivers and lakes Transitional and coastal waters \n\n  \nNotes: The Member States are ranked by the proportion of water bodies classified with high or medium \n\nconfidence. The number of classified water bodies is given in brackets for each Member State. For Finland, the \nnumber of water bodies includes the Aaland RBD. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012.  \n\nThe reasons for reporting low confidence may be related to gaps in assessment systems for certain \n\nquality elements or certain types of water bodies, or lack of monitoring data.  \n\nThe large proportion of water bodies classified with low confidence or with no information on \n\nconfidence suggests that the classification results are quite uncertain for the majority of water bodies \n\nin these first RBMPs. In many cases the classification is probably based merely on expert judgement \n\nand/or on results of the pressure and impact analyses rather than on biological monitoring data and \n\nWFD-compliant classification systems.  \n\nAlthough the knowledge base to classify the ecological status has not been optimal for the first \n\nRBMPs due to missing methods, status class boundaries and monitoring, there has nevertheless been a \n\nsignificant improvement of the knowledge base and increased transparency by compiling together \n\ninformation on all characteristics, pressures and impacts on water bodies compared to the situation \n\nbefore the WFD. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 35 \n\n3.3. Basis for classification of chemical status of surface waters and groundwater \n\n3.3.1. Principles for classification of chemical status  \n\nChemical status is assessed by compliance with environmental standards for chemicals that are listed \n\nin the WFD (Annex X) and the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) Directive 2008/105/EC. \n\nThese chemicals include priority substances, priority hazardous substances and eight other pollutants \n\ncarried over from the Dangerous Substances Daughter Directives. Chemical statuses are recorded as \n\ngood or fail to achieve good status.  \n\n3.3.2. Surface Water  \n\nThe WFD reporting guidance proposed that Member States grouped the reporting of priority \n\nsubstances into four categories; heavy metals, pesticides, industrial pollutants and \u2017other pollutants\u2017 \n\n(EC, 2009). The latter category included a mix of individual chemical types including polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tributyltin compounds. Inconsistency in reporting was apparent \n\nbetween Member States, however, with some reporting a mix of pollutant groups and individual \n\npollutants, whilst others reported either individual pollutants or groups only. Moreover, different \n\nmatrices (i.e. water column, sediment and biota) have sometimes been used to assess the risk of \n\nparticular chemicals across different Member States, meaning that the results arising are not always \n\ndirectly comparable.  \n\n3.3.3. Groundwater  \n\nReporting with respect to WFD groundwater chemical status required a grouping into three \n\ncategories; nitrate, certain pesticides and the Annex II pollutants covering arsenic, cadmium, lead, \n\nmercury, ammonium, chlorides, sulphates, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Inconsistency in \n\nreporting was apparent between Member States, however, with some reporting a mix of pollutant \n\ngroups and individual pollutants, whilst others reported either individual pollutants or groups only. \n\nMoreover, the definition of pollutants and their associated threshold values (as required under the \n\nGroundwater Directive) vary markedly between Member States (EC, 2010a).  \n\n3.4. Pressures and impacts  \n\nSignificant pressures and impacts \n\nTo achieve good ecological status, Member States will have to address the pressures affecting water \n\nbodies. The WFD requires that Member States collect and maintain information on the type and \n\nmagnitude of significant pressures and impacts on their water bodies. The common understanding of a \n\n\u2017significant pressure\u2018 is any pressure that on its own, or in combination with other pressures, may lead \n\nto failure to achieve the WFD objectives of achieving good status. Pressures are emissions of \n\npollutants (e.g. point and diffuse source emissions of nutrients, organic matter, hazardous substances, \n\nwet and dry deposition of long-range transboundary air pollution), emission of cooling water, physical \n\nchanges made to water bodies changing their hydrological and/or morphological characteristics, water \n\nabstraction and biological pressures such as introduction or accidental spreading of invasive species. \n\nImpacts in the WFD sense means effects of these pressures on water bodies in terms of various kinds \n\nof environmental problems occurring in water, such as nutrient enrichment, organic enrichment, \n\nacidification, salinization, temperature increase, altered habitats, contamination with chemicals, water \n\nscarcity etc. \n\n The full list of pressures and impacts is given in WFD CIS guidance no. 3 (EC, 2003b). \n\nThe first identification of pressures and impacts (WFD Article 5) was the basis for the overview of \n\nSignificant Water Management Issues that was reported in 2007 and used for establishing the first \n\nRBMPs. The identification of significant pressures and impacts was further developed in the RBMPs. \n\f\n36 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nPollution and water quality \n\nClean unpolluted water is essential for our ecosystems. Plants and animals in freshwaters react to \n\nchanges in their environment caused by changes in water quality. Pollution takes many forms. Faecal \n\ncontamination from sewage makes water aesthetically unpleasant and unsafe for recreational \n\nactivities, such as swimming. Many organic pollutants, including sewage effluent, as well as farm and \n\nfood-processing wastes consume oxygen, suffocating fish and other aquatic life. Excess nutrients can \n\ncreate eutrophication, characterised by problematic algal blooms, depletion of oxygen and loss of life \n\nin bottom waters, increased plant growth, and an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms \n\npresent in the water. Also pollution with hazardous substances and chemicals can threaten aquatic \n\necosystems and human health. \n\nMany human activities result in water pollution, with the main sources being discharge from urban \n\nwaste water treatment, industrial effluents and losses from farming. During the last century increased \n\npopulation growth and increased wastewater production and discharge from urban areas and industry \n\n(point sources) resulted in a marked increase in water pollution. Due to improved purification of \n\nwaste water and changed industrial production and processes, pollution discharges are today partly \n\ndecoupled from population growth and economic growth.  \n\nAgriculture/farming is a key source of diffuse pollution, but urban land, forestry, atmospheric \n\ndeposition and rural dwellings can also be important sources (Fig. 3.5). Modern-day agricultural \n\npractices often require high levels of fertilisers and manure; leading to high nutrient surpluses that are \n\ntransferred to water bodies through various diffuse processes. \n\nFigure 3.5 Overview of different diffuse sources \n\n \nSource: Environment Agency, 2007\n\n2\n. \n\n \n\nSources for hazardous substances are pesticides and veterinary medicines from farmland, discharge of \n\nheavy metals and some industrial chemicals, and via wastewater from consumer products such as \n\nbody care products, pharmaceuticals and cleaning agents.  \n\nMining exerts a localised but significant pressure upon the chemical and ecological quality of water in \n\nparts of Europe, particularly with respect to the discharge of heavy metals (Johnston et al. 2008). \n\nLandfill sites and contaminated land from historical industrial and military activities can be a source \n\nof pollution to the aquatic environment.  \n\nIntensive aquaculture can be a significant local source of discharges of nutrients and cause \n\neutrophication. Feed spills and excrement are not collected but are released directly into the water.  \n\nOnce released to freshwaters, pollutants can be transported downstream and ultimately discharged to \n\ncoastal waters together with direct discharges from cities and industries. Shipping, harbour and port \n\n                                                      \n2\n Contains Environment Agency information \u00a9 Environment Agency and database right. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 37 \n\nactivities, offshore oil exploration and aquaculture all emit a variety of pollutants adding to the \n\npollution of transitional and coastal waters. \n\nHydromorphology \n\nFor decades, sometimes centuries, humans have altered European surface waters (straightening and \n\ncanalisation, and disconnection of flood plains, land reclamations, dams, weirs, bank reinforcement, \n\netc.) to enable agriculture and urbanisation, produce energy and protect against flooding. The \n\nactivities result in damage to the morphology and hydrology of the water bodies, in other words to \n\ntheir hydromorphology, and results in altered habitats with severe impacts significantly on the status \n\nof the aquatic environments.  \n\nFigure 3.6 Conceptual overview of the relation between drivers, hydromorphological \npressures and habitat and flow alterations \n\nThere are many human activities considered as driving forces that result in hydromorphological \n\npressures and eventually habitat alterations (Fig. 3.6). \n\nAgricultural and forestry activities are in many places affecting the hydromorphological status of \n\nEuropean water bodies. Water storage and abstraction for irrigated agriculture have, in particular in \n\nSouthern Europe changed, the hydrological flow regime of many river basins. In Northern Europe, \n\nmany landscapes have been ditched and lakes drained for agriculture and forestry. Intensification of \n\nagriculture included many land reclamation projects affecting transitional and coastal waters and \n\naffected many rivers that were straightened, deepened and widened to facilitate land drainage and to \n\nprevent local flooding. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nDri vi ng forces   \n\nAgriculture   \n\nUrban   \n\nHydropower   \n\nNavigation   \n\nFlood  \n\nprotection and  \n\ndefence   \n\nMineral  \n\nextraction   \n\nFishing   \n\n  \n\nPhysical modifications   \n\nPressures and   a ctivities   \n\nWater stor age , transfers  and  \n\nabstraction   \n\nCross - profile constructions \n\n( d ams, weirs,  locks/ sluices,  \n\nculverts ,   impoundments)     \n\nLongitudin al pr ofile con struction  \n\n(dykes and  levees )   \n\nB ank reinforcement   and  \n\nembankments   \n\nDeepening and   mineral   \n\nextraction (channel  \n\nmaintenance ,  dredging)   \n\nChannelisation and  \n\nstraightening   \n\nLand drainage and sealing   \n\nHabitat alteration   \n\nImpacts on hydromorphology   \n\nChange in fl ow ( +/ - ) ,  frequency,  \nduration,  seasonality, and  \n\nrate of change \n  \n\nR iver  and habitat continuity  \n\ninterruption   \n\nChange   in sediment  transport   \n\nand  erosion   \n\nChange in lateral connectivity   \n\nloss of floodplain s or intertidal  \n\narea ,   disconnection of wetlands  \n\nand oxbow lakes   \n\nChange in river profile  and  \n\nestuaries (length and transverse   \n\nprofile)   \n\nChange in connection with  \n\ngroundwater   \n\n  \n\f\n38 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nUrban developments have affected many rivers, lakes and coastal waters. During the last centuries \n\nrivers in Europe have been sealed in concrete, habitats have been lost, hydromorphological processes \n\nhave been and are still strongly interrupted, lakes have been isolated or even filled and the coastal \n\nwaterfront has been heavily developed. Impervious sewage collection systems have changed the water \n\nflow regime. \n\n Reservoirs are human-made lakes created by the damming of rivers to serve one or more purposes, \n\nsuch as hydropower production, water supply for drinking, irrigation and flood protection. During the \n\nlast two centuries there has been a marked increase in both the size and number of large storage \n\ncapacity reservoirs, especially with the development of hydropower and large basin management. \n\nThere are currently about 7000 large dams in Europe. In addition, there are thousands of smaller \n\ndams. In 2008 hydropower provided 16% of electricity in Europe and hydropower currently provides \n\nmore than 70% of all renewable electricity. \n\nMarine shipping and inland waterway transport plays an important role in the movement of goods in \n\nEurope. Many thousands of kilometres of waterways connect hundreds of cities and industrial regions. \n\nNavigation activities and/or navigation infrastructure works are typically associated with \n\nhydromorphological pressures. Deepening including channel maintenance, dredging, removal or \n\nreplacement of material is a major activity.  \n\nFlood defence works may cause significant pressures on hydromorphology. Today many sections of \n\nthe major rivers and estuaries have dykes. The building of dykes resulted in the loss of floodplains \n\nand marshes as retention spaces for flood water.  \n\nIn many cases, minerals are extracted from surface water. Gravel and sand extraction have occurred \n\nin several European river basins resulting in widespread channel adjustments in the last 100 years. \n\nHydromorphological pressures, often connected with construction, marine transportation and \n\ntourism, alter the coastal zone, causing considerable changes in physical features of the coast \n\nincluding sediment transport and erosion.  \n\nInvasive Alien Species \n\nBiological pressures related to Invasive Alien Species (IAS) have been identified as a significant \n\npressure in several of the RBMPs. IAS are non-native plants or animals which compete with, and may \n\neven over-run, our natural aquatic plants and animals. Introduction of IAS may alter both species \n\ncomposition and the numbers of different species in surface waters. Escaped farmed salmon for \n\ninstance, represents a serious risk to wild salmon stocks. \n\nClimate change \n\nIt is increasingly being recognised that climate change will have a significant impact on the aquatic \n\nenvironment in Europe (EEA, 2008; Kundzewicz et al., 2007; EEA ETC/W, 2010a; EEA, 2012a). \n\nClimate change is projected to lead to major changes in yearly and seasonal precipitation and water \n\nflow, flooding and coastal erosion risks, water quality, and the distribution of species and ecosystems. \n\nModels indicate that at a general level the south of Europe will show a significant drying trend and the \n\nnorth of Europe a wetter trend. There are many indications that water bodies, which are already under \n\nstress from human activities, are highly susceptible to climate change impacts and that climate change \n\nmay hinder attempts to prevent deterioration and/or restore some water bodies to good status. \n\nAlthough climate change is not explicitly included in the text of the WFD, the step-wise and cyclical \n\napproach of the river basin management planning process makes it well suited to adaptively manage \n\nclimate change impacts.  \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 39 \n\n3.5. Methodology issues in relation to data handling \n\nIn the following is described some of the methodology issues, quality issues and shortcomings in \n\nrelation to analysing the data in the WISE-WFD database. The analysis is based on the set of \n\ninformation which is reported for each water body (Fig. 3.7).  \n\n\uf0b7 Ecological status for natural water bodies. This information is based on more detailed \n\ninformation on which biological quality elements (e.g. macroinvertebrates; phytoplankton); \n\nphysico-chemical quality elemenets (general water quality information e.g. nitrate and \n\nphosphorus and specific pollutants) and hydromorphological quality elements have been used \n\nfor classification. While the reporting requirements refer to the QEs used for classification of \n\nmonitored water bodies, Member States may have classified more water bodies according to a \n\nparticular QE due to grouping.  \n\n\uf0b7 Ecological potential for HMWBs and AWBs. This is either based on the same QEs as for \n\necological status after adjusting for the impacts of the hydromorphological pressures \n\nunderlying the designation of the water body as being heavily modified or artificial, or on the \n\nlevel of measures taken to mitigate the impacts of all other pressures on those water bodies.  \n\n\uf0b7 Chemical status. This is based on priority substances. Chemical status is assessed by \n\ncompliance with environmental standards for chemicals that are listed in the WFD (Annex X) \n\nand the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) Directive 2008/105/EC. These chemicals \n\ninclude priority substances, priority hazardous substances and eight other pollutants carried \n\nover from the Dangerous Substances Daughter Directives. Chemical status is recorded as \n\ngood or failing to achieve good status.  \n\n\uf0b7 Significant pressures such as pressures related to diffuse sources or water flow regulation. \n\nMore than one pressure may apply to a water body. According to the WFD reporting \n\nguidance, significance is defined by each MS according to their interpretation of the WFD \n\nprovisions. \n\n\uf0b7 Significant impacts such as nutrient enrichment; contamination by priority substances; \n\nacidification; and alteration of habitats etc. A water body may be subject to more than one \n\nimpact. According to the WFD reporting guidance, significance is defined by each MS \n\naccording to their interpretation of the WFD provisions. \n\nA water body may have no significant pressure or impact because it is in good (or high) status. \n\nHowever, no reported pressures or impacts may also mean that pressures and impacts have not been \n\nreported or identified.  \n\f\n40 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nFigure 3.7 Conceptual overview of reported information in relation to a water body \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nWater Bodies  \n\n(Rivers, Lakes, \nTransitional and \ncoastal waters; \nGroundwater  \n\nEcological Status \n\n(High to bad or \nunknown status)  \n\nBiological \n\nquality \n\nelements \n\nquality \n\nGeneral \n\nphysicochemical \n\nconditions \n\nelements \n\nChemicals \n\ncompared to \n\nEQSs \n\nChemical status  \n\n(Good or poor, or  \nunknown status)  \n\nHydromorpho\nlogical \n\nconditions \n\nelements \n\nSignificant pressures \n\n(Significance is in relation \nto the failure of a water \nbody to achieve \nenvironmental objectives)  \n \n\n(Significant) impacts \n\n(A water body may be \nsubject to one or more \nimpacts \u2013 or have no \nidentified impacts; or \nunknown inf. an impacts)  \n\nAggregated pressures \n\npoint and diffuse \n\nsources; flow \n\nregulation; river \n\nmanagement etc. \n\nDissagregated \n\npressures \n\nDissagregated \n\npressures \n\nImImpactsacts \nNutrients, Priority \n\nsubstances; \nAcidification; \n\nhydromorphological \nalterations etc.  \n\ngical quality elements  \n\n \n\nNotes:  \nEcological status: only applicable for surface waters, but not for groundwater. \nSignificant pressures: Member States are required to report on the significant pressures on surface and \ngroundwater water bodies.

Significant pressures have been reported at \ndifferent levels of aggregation.

In most cases unclassified water bodies do not have information on pressure and impacts. \nAll analyses done in the following chapters are based on water bodies which are classified with \nrespect to ecological status or potential only. \n\nNo differentiation between ecological status and potential \n\nIn the analyses in this report, no distinction has been made between ecological status and potential. \n\nThe criteria for classification of natural (status) and artificial or heavily modified water bodies \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 41 \n\n(potential) vary, but the ecological conditions they reflect are assumed to be comparable having the \n\nsame deviation from reference conditions or from maximum ecological potential, after adjusting for \n\nthe effects of the physical modifications in case of the HMWB or AWBs. The main aim of this report \n\nis to provide a holistic picture of Europe, not focusing on the differences between the natural vs the \n\nHMWBs and AWBs, and not dealing with the large variation in the proportion of HM and AWBs \n\nbetween Member States. Moreover, presenting the natural and the HMWBs and AWBs in separate \n\ndiagrams would largely increase the number of diagrams in the report. The differences between the \n\necological status of natural water bodies vs the ecological potential of HMWBs and AWBs are \n\nprovided in the separate Hydromorphology assessment report (EEA ETC/ICM, 2012).  \n\n3.5.2.

Introduction \n\nThis chapter provides information at the Member State level on ecological status, pressures and \n\nimpacts with sub-chapters for each water category: Rivers, Lakes, Transitional and Coastal waters. \n\nThe information is based on data that has been reported by Member States along with their first River \n\nBasin Management Plans (WFD Article 13 reports).  \n\nEach water category is presented in the same way, showing two sets of figures using all classified \n\nwater bodies in each country: \n\n1. Three separate bar plots with one bar per country showing  \n\na. Ecological status class distribution, countries are ranked from top to bottom with those with \n\nthe highest proportion of water bodies in good and high ecological status on top and those \n\nwith the lowest proportion in good and high status at the bottom \n\nb. Proportion of water bodies with any pressure reported (red colour) and with no pressures \n\nreported (blue colour). Countries with no pressures reported for any water body have no bar in \n\nthe figure. \n\nc. Proportion of water bodies with any impact reported (red colour) and with no impact reported \n\n(blue colour). Countries with no impacts reported for any water body have no bar in the \n\nfigure. \n\n2. Four separate bar plots with one or two bars per country showing the pressures and impacts that \n\nare most often reported. \n\na. Point source and diffuse source pressures \n\nb. Organic enrichment and nutrient enrichment impacts \n\nc. Contamination impacts, including contamination by priority substances and contaminated \n\nsediments \n\nd. Hydromorphological pressures, including water flow regulation, river/transitional/coastal \n\nmanagement, other morphological alterations, and water abstraction, and altered habitats \n\n(impacts) \n\nFor each water category the ranking of the countries is the same in all these plots and follows that \n\ngiven by the ecological status plot.  \n\nFor the transitional and coastal waters the Member States are grouped into sea regions (for delineation \n\nof sea regions, please see chapter 1). \n\nUncertainties are described in section 4.6.  \n\nFor each water category there are also some case studies included, see section 4.7. \n\n4.2. Rivers  \n\n4.2.1. Main assessment of ecological status and main pressures and impacts \n\nEurope has an extensive network of rivers and streams. In total more than 100 000 river water bodies \n\nwith a length greater than 1.2 million km has been reported by Member States. Five countries, France, \n\nUK, Germany, Sweden and Denmark reported nearly 60% of the river water bodies, while four \n\ncountries, France, Germany, Poland and the UK accounted for nearly half of the river length. \n\n \n\f\n44 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nThe average length of the more than 100 000 reported river water bodies is 11 km. Three Member \n\nStates, Latvia, Bulgaria and Portugal have river water bodies with an average length of more than \n\n30 km. Four Member States, France, Hungary, Poland and Romania have reported river water bodies \n\nwith an average length twice as long as the EU26 average. Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden \n\nhave relatively short river water bodies with an average length less than 5 km, which is less than half \n\nthe EU26 average. Further information is provided in chapter 2 and table 2.6. \n\nFigure 4.1 Ecological status or potential, pressures and impacts of classified river \nwater bodies in different Member States  \n\na) Rivers \u2013  \necological status or potential \n\nb) Rivers - pressures/no \npressures \n\nc) Rivers \u2013  \nimpacts/no impacts \n\n   \nNotes: The figure shows the percentage of the total number of classified river water bodies in different status \n\nclasses (a), with and without pressures (b), and with and without impacts (c).

In Eastern and Southern \n\nEuropean Member States there is larger variability in river status among the countries. \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 45 \n\nFigure 4.2 Proportion of classified rivers exposed to different main pressures and \nimpacts in different Member States  \n\na) Diffuse and point source pollution b) Nutrient and organic enrichment \n\n  c) Contamination d) Hydromorphology and altered habitats \n\n  \nNotes: The Member States are ranked by the proportion of good or better ecological status/potential (see \n\nFig. 4.1a).

Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS and \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_IMPACT_STATUS. \n \n\nSpecific assessment \n\nMany of the Central-European Member States with high population density and intensive agriculture \n\ngenerally have only a small proportion of their river water bodies in good or better ecological status or \n\npotential (lower part of Fig. 4.1a). A high proportion of river water bodies with good ecological status \n\nor potential is mainly reported in Northern Europe (Sweden, Finland, Ireland), in two of the Baltic \n\ncountries (Estonia and Latvia) and in some southern and eastern European Member States (Spain, \n\nPortugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia). The large differences reported between some neighbouring \n\nMember States, e.g. Latvia and Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as between \n\nHungary, Romania and Bulgaria may partly be caused by different assessment approaches. \n\nThe proportion of river water bodies with no significant pressure (Fig. 4.1b) or no impacts (Fig. 4.1c) \n\ngenerally followed the ranking of Member States based on at least good ecological status, i.e. Member \n\nStates having more than 50% of the river water bodies in good ecological status generally also had \n\na high proportion of river water bodies s without pressures and with no identified impacts. In contrast, \n\nthe Member States with a large proportion of water bodies in less than good ecological status \n\ngenerally have the majority of river water bodies with significant pressures and impacts. \n\nThe proportion of river water bodies affected by diffuse pollution (Fig. 4.2a), nutrient enrichment \n\n(Fig. 4.2b), as well as hydromorphological pressures and altered habitats (Fig. 4.2d), generally \n\ncorresponds to the proportion in good ecological status (Fig. 4.1a). \n\nThe most important pollution pressure comes from diffuse sources, causing nutrient enrichment \n\nimpacts in the majority of rivers in most of the Member States having the worst ecological status \n\n(lower part of Fig. 4.1a), with the notable exception of Poland who reported very low diffuse \n\npressures. Most Member States with better ecological status report a lower proportion than the EU \n\naverage of 35% to be affected by diffuse pressures and nutrient enrichment. \n\nSome Member States still have important point source pollution, e.g. Poland and Belgium (Flanders), \n\nwhich is due to lower degree of urban waste water treatment. This pollution is causing quite massive \n\norganic enrichment impacts in their rivers, explaining the poor ecological status. Most Member States, \n\nhowever, have much less point source pollution due to substantial urban waste water treatment over \n\nthe past decade(s), thereby causing organic enrichment in only a minority of rivers.  \n\nContamination by priority substances coming from both point and diffuse source pollution is affecting \n\nless than 25% of rivers in most Member States, except in two Member States (UK and Belgium) (Fig. \n\n4.2c). In Sweden, all the water bodies are subject to the impact contamination by priority substances, \n\nmainly due to mercury in biota. This has little impact on ecological status, although it affects chemical \n\nstatus (Chapter 5.3.2. and chapter 6). \n\nHydromorphological pressures causing altered habitats is the other major pressure in European rivers, \n\naffecting the majority of water bodies in Member States with a large proportion of rivers in moderate \n\nor worse ecological status or potential (Fig. 4.2d). In the Member States with better ecological status \n\nor potential this pressure and impact affect less than 50% of the classified rivers, but is still an \n\nimportant problem in many rivers. \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 47 \n\n4.3. Lakes  \n\n4.3.1. Main assessment of ecological status and main pressures and impacts \n\nIn total around 19 000 lake water bodies with a total area of 88 000 km\n2\n has been reported by 24 \n\nMember states. Two countries, Sweden, and Finland, reported more than two thirds of the lake water \n\nbodies and lake area. \n\nThe average area of the reported lake water bodies is 4.6 km\n2\n. Four Member States (Austria, Estonia, \n\nGreece and Spain) have an average size of lake water bodies greater than 10 km\n2\n. Half of the reported \n\nlakes are less than 1 km\n2\n in area and more than 87% of the reported lake water bodies have an area \n\nless than 5 km\n2\n. Only 78 of the reported lake water bodies have an area greater than 150 km\n\n2\n; more \n\nthan half of these are found in Finland and Sweden. \n\nMain messages \n\n\uf0b7 For lakes, 6500 water bodies (44% of the total number) are reported to be in less than good \n\necological status or potential.  \n\n\uf0b7 The main pressures responsible for the degraded ecological status or potential in these lakes \n\nare diffuse sources, causing nutrient enrichment, as well as hydromorphological changes \n\ncausing altered habitats.  \n\uf0b7 The worst ecological status, pressures and impacts in lakes are found in Central European \n\nMember States with a high population density and intensive agriculture, while Northern \n\nEurope and Austria shows a far better situation due to lower pressures and impacts.  \n\nFigure 4.3 Ecological status or potential, pressures and impacts of classified lake \nwater bodies in different Member States  \n\na) Lakes \u2013  \necological status or potential \n\nb) Lakes - pressures/no \npressures \n\nc) Lakes \u2013  \nimpacts/no impacts \n\n   \nNotes: The figure shows the percentage of the total number of lake water bodies in different status classes (a), \n\nwith and without pressures (b), and with and without impacts (c).

Detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS and \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_IMPACT_STATUS. \n \n\nSpecific assessment \n\nFor lakes, there are close to 6500 water bodies (44% of the total number), or close to 31 900 km\n2\n \n\n(39 % of total lakes surface area) reported to be in less than good ecological status or potential \n\n(Fig. 4.3a). The main causes for the poor ecological status or potential in these lake water bodies are \n\ndiffuse sources coming from agriculture, causing nutrient enrichment, as well as hydromorphological \n\nchanges causing altered habitats.  \n\nMany of the Central-European Member States generally have more than half of their lake water \n\nbodies in less than good ecological status or potential, corresponding to a generally high level \n\nof pressures and impacts due to high population density and intensive agriculture (lower part of \n\nFig. 4.3a). In Member States in Northern Europe (Sweden, Finland, Ireland), and in two of the Baltic \n\ncountries (Estonia and Lithuania) where the level of pressures and impacts are lower, the majority \n\nof lake water bodies are reported to be in good or better ecological status or potential. The highest \n\nproportion of lake water bodies with good ecological status or potential is reported in Austria, \n\nprobably reflecting the positive effect of ring-canals installed in the 1970s for capturing sewage and \n\nother nutrient emissions (Sampl et al., 1989).  \n\nThe most important pollution pressure comes from diffuse sources, causing nutrient enrichment \n\nimpacts in the majority of lakes in most of the Member States having the worst ecological status \n\n(Fig. 4.4). Diffuse pollution / nutrient enrichment are important also in Member States with better \n\necological status of their lake water bodies (Fig. 4.4a, b). \n\nPoint source pollution causing organic enrichment of lakes is generally reported to affect fewer lake \n\nwater bodies in most Member States compared to the fairly large proportion of lakes affected by \n\ndiffuse pollution and nutrient enrichment. This is due to substantial urban waste water treatment over \n\nthe past decade(s). However, organic enrichment is still reported to be an important impact in Member \n\nStates with poor ecological status in a high proportion of lake water bodies, e.g. Belgium and Greece. \n\nContamination by priority substances coming from both point and diffuse source pollution is a minor \n\nimpact in most Member States, except in Belgium and the UK, where this impact is reported for 40\n50% of the lake water bodies (Fig. 4.4c). In Sweden, all the lake water bodies are subject to diffuse \n\npressures of priority substances and contamination impact, mainly due to mercury in biota, but this \n\nhas little impact on ecological status, although it affects chemical status. Therefore these data have \n\nbeen excluded from the analyses of pressures and impacts affecting ecological status. \n\nHydromorphological pressures causing altered habitats is the other major pressure in European lakes, \n\naffecting the majority of water bodies in Member States with a large proportion of lakes in moderate \n\nor worse ecological status or potential (Fig. 4.4d). In Member States with ecological status \n\nor potential better than the EU average, this pressure and impact affect less than 30% of the classified \n\nlakes. \n\n4.3.2. Ecological status, pressures and impacts of Europe\u2019s largest lakes \n\nThe largest lakes of Europe are the lakes Ladoga and Onega in Russia. Within the EU, the largest \n\nlakes are V\u00e4nern, V\u00e4ttern and M\u00e4laren in Sweden, Lake Saimaa in Finland, Lake Peipsi \n\nin Estonia/Russia, and Lake Ijsselmeer in the Netherlands. All these lakes have a surface area more \n\nthan 1000 km\n2\n. \n\n \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\n50 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nMany large, deep lakes in Europe were degraded in the 1960s to 1980s in terms of nutrient \n\nenrichment caused by point source emissions, but have now been largely restored due to improved \n\nurban waste water treatment following the implementation of the UWWTD and other restoration \n\nmeasures. The case studies in chapter 4.7 on Lago Maggiore, Lake V\u00e4nern and Lake Balaton illustrate \n\nthis improvement in the latter decades, although some impacts still remain in certain parts of these \n\nlakes. \n\nBased on the Member States reporting of lake water bodies in the river basin management plans, there \n\nare 67 classified lake water bodies with a surface area larger than 150 km\n2\n. One third of these are in \n\nless than good ecological status or potential (Fig. 4.5).  \n\nMost of the large lake water bodies are found in Sweden and Finland, and the large majority of these \n\n(74%) are in good or better ecological status or potential. Only half of the large lake water bodies in \n\nthe rest of Europe (excluding Sweden and Finland) are in good or better ecological status or potential.  \n\nThe only large lake water body reported to be in poor status in Sweden and Finland is the Swedish \n\nlake Hj\u00e4lmaren. Lake Hj\u00e4lmaren is a shallow, lowland lake suffering from nutrient enrichment caused \n\nby run-off from large agricultural areas surrounding the lake and sewage water from the town \u00d6rebro \n\nin the westernmost part (ILEC, 2012a).  \n\nParts of other large lakes, such as eutrophied shallow bays receiving diffuse or point source pollution \n\nmay also be in less than good status, but these do not appear among the large lake water bodies shown \n\nin Fig. 4.5 because they are delineated as separate water bodies with surface area less than 150 km\n2\n. \n\nFigure 4.5 Ecological status or potential of classified lake water bodies with surface \narea more than 150 km2 \n\n \nNote: The number of classified large lake water bodies > 150 km\n\n2\n is given in brackets. \n\nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS.  \n\nSlightly more than half of the large lake water bodies (53%) are reported to have no significant \n\npressures (Fig. 4.6), while close to 80% are reported to have no impacts, indicating that some of the \n\npressures have little impact on these large lake water bodies. Particularly the hydromorphology \n\npressures seem to cause little impact, as 30% are exposed to hydromorphology pressures, but only \n\n10% are reported to have altered habitats. The explanation is that Sweden has not reported altered \n\nhabitats as an impact. Also for point and diffuse source pollution and \u2015other pressures\u2016, the proportion \n\nof exposed water bodies are higher than the impacted water bodies, probably because those pressures \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 51 \n\naffect only smaller parts of these large lake water bodies. Diffuse source pollution causing nutrient \n\nenrichment is nevertheless the most important pressure and impact in large lakes, implying that \n\nreduction of diffuse pollution is required to restore all large lakes back to good status. \n\nFigure 4.6 Pressures (left) and impacts (right) reported in large lake water bodies \n\n \nNotes: The percentage is calculated against the total number of classified lake water bodies with surface areas \n\nmore than 150 km\n2\n in Member States reporting the specific pressure or impact type (or any pressure or impact \n\nfor the blue bars).

Main assessment of ecological status and main pressures and impacts \n\nMain messages \n\n\uf0b7 A large majority of transitional water bodies are in less than good ecological status in most \n\nMember States and sea regions, due to extensive multiple pressures and impacts. \n\n\uf0b7 Both diffuse and point source pollution causing nutrient and organic enrichment, \n\ncontamination by priority substances, as well as hydromorphological pressures causing \n\naltered habitats are all responsible for the degraded ecological status in transitional waters.  \n\n\uf0b7 For transitional waters in the Celtic Sea to the Iberian Coast the situation is less severe with \n\nclose to half of the water bodies in good ecological status or potential, probably due to a better \n\nwater exchange. \n\nFigure 4.7 Ecological status or potential, pressures and impacts of classified \ntransitional water bodies in different sea regions and Member States  \n\na) Transitional waters - \necological status or potential \n\nb) Transitional waters - \npressures/no pressures \n\nc) Transitional waters - \nimpacts/no impacts \n\n   \nNotes: The figure shows the percentage of the total number of transitional water bodies in different status \n\nclasses (a), with and without pressures (b), and with and without impacts (c) in Member States bordering Sea \nregions.

Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS and \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_IMPACT_STATUS. \n \n\nAll classified transitional water bodies in eight Member States (Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, \n\nNetherlands, Germany, Belgium (Flanders) and Romania) are reported to be in less than good \n\necological status or potential (moderate, poor or bad) (Fig. 4.7a). A high percentage (> 80%) of \n\ntransitional water bodies in less than good status is also reported by Greece and France in the \n\nMediterranean and by Bulgaria and Romania in the Black Sea. In most Member States and sea regions \n\nthe proportion of water bodies subject to pressures and impacts mostly corresponds to the proportion \n\nin less than good ecological status or potential (Fig. 4.7b, c). \n\nSpecific assessment of ecological status or potential  \n\nBaltic Sea \n\nThe worst ecological status or potential in European transitional waters is found in the Baltic Sea \n\nregion (data from Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland), where all reported transitional water bodies \n\nare classified as less than good. Poland reported 50% of their transitional waters to be in bad status.  \n\nGreater North Sea \n\nTransitional water bodies draining to the Greater North Sea are predominantly in less than good status \n\n(moderate and less), with the exception of 30-40% of the transitional water bodies in UK and France \n\nwith good or better status. \n\nCeltic Sea to the Iberian Coast \n\nThe best situation for classified transitional water bodies is reported in the region of the Celtic Sea to \n\nthe Iberian coast, where more than 74% of the French water bodies (Loire RBD only), 60% of water \n\nbodies in Portugal and 53% of the Spanish water bodies are in good or better ecological status or \n\npotential. Another positive result in this region is that there are almost no water bodies reported to be \n\nin bad status, and also very few in poor status. For the UK and Ireland however, a large proportion of \n\ntransitional water bodies are reported to be in moderate status.  \n\nMediterranean Sea \n\nIn the Mediterranean Sea, all Member States with data for transitional water have reported a majority \n\nof water bodies to be in less than good ecological status or potential. The situation is worst in France \n\nwith more than 90% of the classified transitional water bodies reported to be in less than good status \n\nand more than 60% in poor or bad status. In Spain the situation is better with more than 40% of the \n\nclassified transitional water bodies in good or better status or potential. \n\nThe proportion of water bodies exposed to pressures reported from Spain and France in the region of \n\nthe Celtic Seas to the Iberian Coast is higher than those reported for the same Member States for \n\nwater bodies along the Mediterranean Sea, while the picture for the ecological status or potential is the \n\nopposite, with better status in the water bodies in the region of the Celtic Seas to the Iberian Coast \n\nthan in water bodies along the Mediterranean. This paradox may be related to the more exposed \n\nnature of the transitional water bodies along the Atlantic coast of France and Spain than along their \n\nMediterranean coasts, ensuring a better dilution of the pollution causing less ecological effects. \n\nBlack Sea \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 55 \n\nFor the EU part of the Black Sea a large majority of the transitional water bodies in Bulgaria and \n\nRomania are reported to be in poor or bad status or potential, and only 13% are reported to be in good \n\nstatus (Bulgaria) (Fig. 4.7a).  \n\nSpecific assessment of different pressures and impacts \n\nPollution pressures and impacts \n\nIn the Baltic Sea, Sweden, Lithuania and Latvia reported impacts by nutrient and organic enrichment \n\n(Fig. 4.8), reflecting the well-known eutrophication problem (HELCOM 2010a). No information on \n\npressures and impacts are reported from other Baltic Sea Member States. \n\nIn the Greater North Sea, point and diffuse source pollution are equally important, as point sources are \n\nreported in 44% of transitional water bodies, while 42% of waters are influenced by significant \n\ndiffuse sources. In Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium Flanders and Germany all classified transitional \n\nwater bodies are exposed to significant diffuse sources pollution, while 80%-100% are exposed to \n\npoint source pollution. Point sources are also significant in 20-50% of the transitional water bodies in \n\nthe other Greater North Sea countries.  \n\nIn the Celtic Seas to the Iberian Coast 24% of the transitional water bodies are influenced by \n\nsignificant diffuse sources. The proportion of water bodies impacted by nutrient enrichment ranges \n\nfrom 5% in Spain to 19% in UK. Point sources are reported to affect half of the transitional water \n\nbodies, ranging from 30-60% in Spain, UK and Ireland to 90% in France. Organic enrichment is \n\nreported mainly by France (90%) and to a lower extent by the UK (37%).  \n\nIn the Mediterranean Sea, significant diffuse sources are reported in 41% of the transitional water \n\nbodies, ranging from 50-60% in Italy, Greece, France and only 20% in Spain. Nutrient enrichment is \n\nalso significant in 44% of transitional waters, ranging from less than 20% in Spain, 45% in France and \n\nGreece to almost 100% in Italy. Point source pollution is a significant pressure in only 24% of the \n\nclassified transitional water bodies, ranging from 20-50% in Spain, Italy and France. There is a \n\ngeneral agreement between the proportion of diffuse pressures/impacts by nutrient enrichment and \n\npressures by point sources/organic enrichment impacts reported by Mediterranean countries. \n\nIn the Black Sea area, both diffuse and point source pollution pressures are significant in ~90% \n\n(diffuse sources) and 60% (point sources) of the transitional water bodies. Impacts by nutrient \n\nenrichment are reported in 70% of the water bodies, but only less than 10% are reported to be \n\nimpacted by organic enrichment.  \n\nContamination \n\nContamination impacts are reported to be most severe in the Greater North Sea and least severe in the \n\nCeltic Sea to Iberian Coast. However, major gaps in reporting of this impact prevent further \n\nassessment of this impact in other sea regions. Evaluation of the effects of contamination on chemical \n\nstatus is given in chapter 6. \n\nHydromorphological pressures and altered habitats \n\nSignificant hydromorphological pressures causing altered habitats are reported to affect a large \n\nproportion of the transitional waters in the Greater North Sea, especially in Begium, the Netherlands \n\nand Germany, where all the transitional water bodies are affected. This pressure is also important in \n\nthe Celtic Seas to the Iberian Coast and in the Mediterranean Sea. In the Celtic Seas to the Iberian \n\nCoast most of the Member States reported hydromorphological pressures and altered habitats in 30\n50% of the transitional water bodies, except France where only 10% are reported to be affected by \n\nthis pressure and impact. In the Mediterranean Sea 30-50% of the classified transitional water bodies \n\nare subject to significant hydromorphological pressures causing altered habitats.  \n\f\n56 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nNone of the Member States in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea reported information \n\non hydromorphological pressures and altered habitats. \n\nOverseas areas \n\nPortugal reported three transitional water bodies in Macaronesia (The Azores and Madeira). Two of \n\nthese waters are in less than good status (Fig. 4.9a), corresponding to exposure to significant pressures \n\nand impacts (Fig. 4.9b, c). Hydromorphological pressures and altered habitats are the only pressure \n\nand impact reported for all the water bodies in less than good status.  \n\nFrance reported 12 transitional water bodies in the Caribbean Sea. 92% of these water bodies are \n\nreported to be in less than good status (Fig. 4.9a). All water bodies are reported to have significant \n\npressures (Fig. 4.9b, c), due to pollution from diffuse sources and point sources. It is not clear why the \n\nproportion of water bodies with impacts are so much lower than the proportion in less than good \n\nstatus and the proportion exposed to significant pollution pressures. No hydromorphological pressures \n\nand altered habitats are reported in the area. \n\nFigure 4.9 Ecological status or potential, pressures and impacts of classified \ntransitional water bodies by overseas sea regions and Member States  \n\na) Transitional waters - \necological status or potential \n\nb) Transitional waters - \npressures/no pressures \n\nc) Transitional waters - \nimpacts/no impacts \n\n   \nNotes: The figure shows the percentage of the total number of transitional water bodies in different status \n\nclasses (a), with and without pressures (b), and with and without impacts (c).

Coastal waters \n\n4.5.1. Main assessment of ecological status and main pressures and impacts \n\nMain messages \n\nThe worst ecological status in coastal waters is reported in the Baltic Sea, followed by the North Sea \n\nand the Black Sea. In the coastal waters in the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic coast (Celtic sea \n\nto the Iberian coast) a higher proportion of the coastal water bodies have high or good ecological \n\nstatus. The distribution of pressures and impacts mostly corresponds to reported ecological status; in \n\ngeneral coastal waters with a high proportion of water bodies in good status also have a high \n\nproportion of water bodies without pressures and impacts. \n\n\uf0b7 Pollution is reported as pressure affecting 80% of the coastal water bodies in the Baltic Sea \n\nand more than half of the water bodies in the Greater North Sea. Also in the other sea regions \n\nseveral Member States have a high proportion of coastal water bodies affected by pollution \n\nsources. A lower proportion of water bodies affected by pollution pressures are found for the \n\nopen Atlantic coast (Celtic sea to the Iberian coast). \n\n\uf0b7 Generally a higher proportion of water bodies are affected by diffuse polution sources \n\ncompared to point sources. The pollution pressures result in a large proportion of the water \n\nbodies being impacted by organic and in particular nutrient enrichment. \n\nFigure 4.10 Ecological status or potential, pressures and impacts of classified coastal \nwater bodies by sea regions and Member States  \n\na) Coastal waters \u2013  \necological status \n\nb) Coastal waters - \npressures/no pressures \n\nc) Coastal waters \u2013  \nimpacts/no impacts \n\n   \nNotes: The figure shows the percentage of the total number of coastal water bodies in different status classes \n\n(a), with and without pressures (b), and with and without impacts (c).

Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS and \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_IMPACT_STATUS. \n \n\nSpecific assessment \n\nAll coastal water bodies in 8 out of 21 Member States (Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark, Poland, Belgium, \n\nthe Netherlands, Germany (the part draining into the Greater North Sea) and Romania) are in less than \n\ngood status (moderate, poor or bad) (Fig. 4.10a). Cyprus is the only country where all coastal waters \n\nare reaching good and high status. \n\nThe worst situation is reported in the Baltic Sea countries, where 83% of coastal water bodies are \n\nreported to be in less than good ecological status. Only around 2-30% of coastal water bodies in \n\nGermany, Finland, Sweden and Estonia are in good/high status. Also in the Greater North Sea, the \n\necological conditions of the coastal water bodies are not good for most of the Member States, except \n\nin France and the UK, who report good or better status for close to 60% and 70% of their coastal \n\nwater bodies respectively.  \n\nThe best ecological status of coastal waters is found in the Celtic sea to the Iberian coast, where \n\nwaters from Spain, the UK, France, Portugal and Ireland are reported. In this area, 70-90% of coastal \n\nwaters are reaching the environmental objective. Overall, only 15% of the waters are in poor or bad \n\nstatus in this region. Similarly, 60-90% of coastal water bodies in the Mediterranean Sea are reported \n\nto be in good/high status.  \n\nIn the EU part of the Black Sea the situation for the coastal water bodies is also quite problematic with \n\n60% of the coastal water bodies in Bulgaria being in moderate and poor status, whereas all the coastal \n\nwater bodies in Romania fail to achieve good status (Fig. 4.10a). \n\nMost coastal waters are subject to significant pressures and impacts, yet to lesser extent than \n\ntransitional waters. The distribution of pressures and impacts mostly corresponds to reported \n\necological status, except for Poland, where significant pressures are reported for a low proportion of \n\ncoastal water bodies, even though all water bodies are reported to be in less than good status. On the \n\ncontrary, Italy, in which most of coastal water bodies (85%) are in good or high status, reported a high \n\npercentage of waters being exposed to significant pressures and impacts (Fig. 4.10b, c). The same is \n\ntrue for the French Atlantic coast (Greater North Sea region and Celtic Sea to Iberian Coast region), \n\nwhere the large majority of coastal water bodies are reported to have good status, but only a minority \n\nis reported to be without significant pressures or impacts.  \n\nDiffuse sources are reported as significant in 78% of the coastal water bodies in Baltic Sea and 53 % \n\nin the Greater North Sea (Gig. 4.11). Diffuse pollution pressures appear to be most significant in \n\nFinland, Sweden and Germany (Baltic Sea). In the Greater North Sea, Germany (100%), Sweden \n\n(96%), and the Netherlands (70%) report significant diffuse pressures for the large majority of their \n\ncoastal water bodies, in contrast to France and in particular the UK, where this pressure is reported to \n\nbe of less importance. 75% of coastal waters in the Baltic Sea and 49% in the Greater North Sea are \n\nimpacted by nutrient enrichment (no data from the Netherlands and Belgium included). Although all \n\nof Germany\u2018s coastal waters are affected by diffuse pressures, the proportion of coastal water bodies \n\naffected by nutrient enrichment is 23% in the Greater North Sea, and 44% in the Baltic German \n\ncoastal water bodies.  \n\nIn both the Baltic Sea and the Greater North Sea only 17% of coastal water bodies are reported to be \n\naffected by pressures from point sources, and even fewer coastal water bodies (7%) are reported to be \n\nsubject to organic enrichment (Fig. 4.11b). \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\n60 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nPoint sources are reported as significant in 20% of coastal water bodies in the Celtic Seas to the \n\nIberian Coast (mostly in France). The proportion impacted by organic enrichment in this part of the \n\nFrench coast is high (77%), consistent with 73% affected by point sources. Diffuse pressures (as well \n\nas nutrient enrichment impacts) do not seem to be important in coastal water bodies of the Celtic Seas \n\nto the Iberian Coast.  \n\nIn the Mediterranean Sea, point sources are reported as significant for half of the water bodies in Italy, \n\nFrance and Malta, although only Italy reports corresponding organic enrichment. Only Malta reports \n\na high proportion of coastal water bodies to be exposed to significant diffuse sources. In Italian \n\ncoastal waters, diffuse source pollution are reported for one third of their coastal water bodies, while \n\nhalf of the water bodies are subject to nutrient enrichment. No organic or nutrient enrichment was \n\nreported by France in the Mediterranean, despite a high percentage of significant point sources. \n\nIn the Black Sea, both Bulgaria and Romania reported relatively high proportions of coastal water \n\nbodies to be exposed to pollution pressures from point and diffuse sources, as well as nutrient and \n\norganic impacts, although the impacts are not quite consistent with the pressures (Fig. 4.11a, b). \n\nContamination impacts are reported to be most severe in Bulgaria, where half of the water bodies are \n\naffected. Other Member States reporting significant contamination impacts are Sweden, Italy, Malta \n\nand Romania (Fig. 4.11c). However, major gaps in reporting of this impact prevent further assessment \n\nof this impact in other Member States and sea regions. The effects on contamination on chemical \n\nstatus are given in chapter 6. \n\nHydromorphological pressures and altered habitats are reported to affect a relatively low proportion \n\nof coastal water bodies in most Member States and sea regions, although nine Member States reported \n\nsignificant hydromorphological pressures in 20-50% of their coastal water bodies (Fig. 4.11d). The \n\nworst situation concerning these pressures is found in the Netherlands, where 80% of the coastal \n\nwater bodies are reported to be exposed to hydromorphological pressures.  \n\nOverseas areas \n\nPortugal reported 27 coastal water bodies in Macaronesia (the Azores and Madeira). All of these \n\nwaters are in good status (Fig. 4.12a, b, c), without significant pressures and impacts. \n\nFigure 4.12 Ecological status or potential, pressures and impacts of classified coastal \nwater bodies by overseas sea regions and Member States  \n\na) Coastal waters - ecological \nstatus or potential \n\nb) Coastal waters - \npressures/no pressures \n\nc) Coastal waters - impacts/no \nimpacts \n\n   \nNotes: The figure shows the percentage of the total number of coastal water bodies in different status classes \n\n(a), with and without pressures (b), and with and without impacts (c).

Half or more of the water \n\nbodies in these areas are reported to be have significant pressures and impacts (Fig. 4.12a, b, c) from \n\npoint and diffuse sources causing nutrient and organic enrichment. \n\n4.6. Uncertainties of results \n\nThe basis for assessing ecological status or potential of water bodies in the first RBMPs is quite weak \n\nin some Member States, causing uncertainty in the results described below. The comparability across \n\nMember States and RBDs is therefore limited. \n\nDifferent and/or incomplete assessment and monitoring approaches contribute to uncertainty \n\nof results. The large differences in the proportion of water bodies in less than good status between \n\nsome neighbouring Member States are thus uncertain and should be interpreted with care, \n\ne.g. difference of status of rivers in Lithuania and Latvia, or in Hungary and Romania (Fig. 4.1). The \n\nhigh proportion of water bodies in good or better ecological status reported for coastal and transitional \n\nwaters from southern Italy are also uncertain, as the classified water bodies only constitute 10% of all \n\nthe transitional and coastal water bodies. \n\nDifferent assessment approaches also contribute to uncertainties concerning large differences between \n\nwater categories in the same Member State, e.g. in Romania, where less than 20% of the lake water \n\nbodies (Fig. 4.3), but more than 60% of the river water bodies (Fig. 4.1) are reported to be in good or \n\nbetter ecological status or potential. In Lithuania, the situation is opposite with better status in the \n\nlakes than in the rivers: close to 70% of the lakes water bodies, but only 40% of the river water bodies \n\nare reported to be in good ecological status or potential. These differences may however also have \n\nnatural explanations related to the geographical location of lakes versus rivers in these countries. \n\nDue to incomplete reporting or mistakes in the reporting of pressures and impacts by countries, it is \n\nnot always possible to establish a link between pollution sources and nutrient/organic enrichment. For \n\nexample, Latvia has not reported any significant pressures or impacts for close to 100% of their lake \n\nwater bodies, in spite of having more than half of their lake water bodies in less than good ecological \n\nstatus or potential. Poland reports lower pressures on their lake water bodies (less than 20% with \n\npressures) than the ecological status reporting would suggest (less than 50% in good or better status). \n\nLithuania reported that the two coastal water bodies are both impacted by nutrient and organic \n\nenrichment, yet no corresponding information on pressures is available. The situation is reverse \n\nfor the Netherlands, where significant pressures are reported from point/diffuse sources, but no impact \n\nrelated to organic and nutrient enrichment. Although the proportion of Italian transitional water bodies \n\ninfluenced by diffuse pressures is slightly above 60%, nutrient enrichment is reported to 95% \n\nof transitional water bodies. In Spain more than 40% are influenced by hydromorphological pressures, \n\nwhereas only 5% are impacted by altered habitats. Portugal reported 36% of transitional water bodies \n\nwith significant hydromorphological pressures, but no altered habitats. These inconsistencies may also \n\nbe caused by lack of information on pressures and/or impacts. \n\nIn Italy, the north-south distinction with better status and less pressures in the north than in the south \n\nneeds further clarification, as a large proportion of the population and industry and most of the \n\nintensive agriculture is located in the Po RBD. The better status and fewer pressures in water bodies \n\nin the Alpine area of the Po may contribute to explain why this RBD is not worse than the \n\nsouthernmost RBD.

These characteristics makes it a very \n\nsensitive area with low self-purification capacity. The Baltic Sea receives waters \n\nfrom all the 14 countries in the catchment, bringing large amounts of nutrients, \n\norganic substances and toxic pollutants. Accumulation and impacts of human \n\nactivities are aggravated by natural characteristics of the Baltic Sea.  \n\n\uf0b7 Coastal areas are mainly affected by point-source pollution. Open-sea areas are \n\naffected by fishing, riverine pollution and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Another \n\nimportant issue is also disturbance of the seabed by construction, dredging and \n\ndisposal of dredged material, which creates large impacts on local environments, \n\nwhereas bottom trawling affects large areas of the sea.  \n\n\uf0b7 The HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment shows that the environmental status \n\nof the Baltic Sea is generally impaired.

After the flood disaster of 1953 it was decided \n\nto improve flood protection in the Scheldt estuary. Most transitional water bodies with \n\nexception of the Western Scheldt, have been closed off completely or have a reduced \n\nexchange with the North Sea. Therefore these water bodies were converted into basins \n\nwith a strongly regulated hydrological regime and salinity.  \n\n\uf0b7 Main pressures in the RBD are related to use of hard infrastructure for coastal protection \n\nand erosion management.

The 652 km long river has a 74 000 km\n2\n \n\ndrainage area of which 55% is mountainous and the remaining 45% is located in \n\nthe Po valley lowland plain of rich soil. The Po river brings roughly half of the total \n\nfreshwater input to the northern Adriatic Sea. \n\n\uf0b7 The Po is heavily impacted by nutrient enrichment, organic enrichment, altered \n\nhabitats and water abstraction due to a combination of large areas with intensive \n\nagriculture, increasing urbanisation, and flood protection structures. Groundwater \n\nresources continue to contain high concentrations of nitrates due to fertilizer use in \n\nagriculture, while excessive exploitation has caused salt intrusion into coastal \n\naquifers.

The most \n\nimportant variable influencing species distribution and diversity is the degree of water \n\nexchange with the sea and the nutrient load introduced through fresh water inputs. The \n\nmost extensive lagoon systems are located in Western and Northern Greece. Coastal \n\nlagoons and surrounding wetlands comprise of a high variety of biotopes and \n\nvegetation types. The habitat types such as riparian floodplains and surrounding \n\nwetlands present a unique diversity of invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians. \n\nThousands of migrating birds congregate in these lagoons, which are a source of food \n\nand place of rest during spring migration.  \n\n\uf0b7 The biodiversity and productivity of the lagoons in Greece are threatened by severe \n\nanthropogenic pressures such as damming, pollution, water flow modifications, fish \n\nfarming, overfishing and alien species. The increased damming of rivers led to reduced \n\nriver flow and terrestrial sediment input. An increased nutrient and pollutant influx is \n\nassociated with agriculture and urban development. A considerable loss of the wetlands \n\nsurrounding the coastal lagoons due to the increase of agricultural activities led to \n\na decline of water retention and purification capacity of these ecosystems.  \n\n\uf0b7 Eutrophication has dramatically increased over the last decades, due to human activity \n\nin the catchment areas. The nutrient enrichment led to a replacement of sea-grasses by \n\nopportunistic green macroalgae, whereas the loss of sea-grass beds and the degradation \n\nof the water quality caused a decrease in species diversity and a decline in fish \n\nabundance. \n\nMain diagram \n\n \n\nAmvrakikos lagoons \n\n \nPhoto: Aerophotographs N.D.

Appendix with notes for figures and tables \n\nFigure 4.1 /4.2/4.3/4.4/4.6/4.7/4.8/4.10/4.11 \n\nMember States are excluded from the calculations when no data on a specific pressure and/or impact \n\nare reported for the water category in question. In all the listed figures except Fig. 4.6 this means that \n\ncertain rows are missing in the pressures/impacts plots. Exclusion of certain Member States also \n\naffects the calculations for the EU total. It is impossible to differentiate between Member States not \n\nreporting a specific pressure or impact, or Member States for which the specific pressure or impact is \n\nnot affecting any water bodies. In most cases the former is likely to be true, as it is usually unrealistic \n\nthat not a single water body is affected. But for certain pressures/impacts (e.g. acidification) it is \n\npossible that no water bodies are affected. For transitional and coastal waters, where the number \n\nof water bodies in certain countries is low, it is also possible that all are in fact unaffected. In all \n\nfigures the number of classified water bodies is given in brackets behind the Member State name \n\nwhen the Member State has reported the specific pressure or impact. In very few cases a number is \n\ngiven in brackets even if there is no bar (this goes only for Figs. 4.2, 4.8, 4.10 and 4.11). This means \n\nthat it has been confirmed that no water bodies are affected by the specific pressure or impact. \n\nIn Figs. 4.8 and 4.11 it has also been assumed that when a Member State generally has reported \n\na specific pressure or impact, no data for certain parts of the Member State means that the water \n\nbodies here are actually not affected. In all other cases, no number is given in brackets, indicating that \n\nno data is reported. This will then, in very few cases, include Member States where no water bodies \n\nof that water category are affected by the specific pressure or impact. In such cases the proportion of \n\nwater bodies affected by the specific pressure or impact for EU total will be underestimated, as the \n\ntotal number of classified water bodies in the Member States defined as not reporting is subtracted \n\nfrom the total number of classified water bodies in the EU. \n\nIreland only reported impacts for one RBD, so Irish water bodies are removed both from the number \n\nof water bodies affected and from the number of total classified water bodies in all impacts plots. For \n\nSweden, wherever the pressures or impacts reporting is related to airborne mercury pollution only, the \n\nwater bodies are considered not to be affected by pressures or impacts, respectively (see text). For \n\npressures overall (Figs. 4.1, 4.3, 4.7 and 4.10 and \u2015no pressures\u2016 in Fig. 4.6) this occurs when the \n\naggregated diffuse pressure type is the only pressure and the impacts description indicates diffuse \n\npollution from mercury only. For impacts overall (Figs. 4.1, 4.3, 4.7 and 4.10 and \u2015no impacts\u2016 in \n\nFig. 4.6) this occurs when contamination by priority substances is the only impact (Sweden did not \n\nreport the impact type \u2015contaminated sediments\u2016) and the impact description does not indicate \n\ncontamination by other priority substances than mercury. For the diffuse sources pressure (Figs. 4.2, \n\n4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.11) this occurs when the aggregated diffuse pressure type is the only diffuse \n\npressure type and the impact description indicates diffuse mercury pollution only. For the impact \n\ncontamination (Figs. 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.11) this occurs when water bodies are reported with the \n\nimpact contamination by priority substances, but the impact description does not indicate \n\ncontamination by other priority substances than mercury.

Ecological status or potential for different water categories  \n\nOverall, more than half (55 %) of the total number of classified surface water bodies in Europe are \n\nreported to have less than good ecological status/potential. All these water bodies thereby need \n\nmanagement measures to restore their ecological status or potential to fulfil the WFD objective. \n\nA higher proportion of water bodies with moderate or worse ecological status/potential is reported for \n\nrivers and transitional waters (56-67%) than for lakes and coastal waters (44-49%) (Fig. 5.1).  \n\nFigure 5.1 Distribution of ecological status or potential of classified rivers, lakes, \ntransitional and coastal waters \n\n \n\n \nNotes: Upper panel shows percentage of the total number of classified water bodies (with total number given in \n\nbrackets). Lower panel shows percentage of the total length (in km for classified rivers) or surface area (in km\n2\n \n\nfor classified lakes, coastal and transitional waters) (total length or surface area given in brackets). See chapter 3 \nfor methodology used for assessing ecological status or potential and appendix notes for Fig. 5.0 on countries \nreporting and water bodies classified. For length/area issues see appendix. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS. \n\nFor rivers, 51 300 water bodies (56% of the total number), or 630 000 km (64% of total river length) \n\nare reported to have less than good ecological status or potential. For lakes, 6 500 lake water bodies \n\n(44% of total number) or close to 31 900 km\n2\n (39% of total surface area) are reported to be in less \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\n80 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nthan good ecological status or potential. The reason why lakes are better than rivers is probably \n\nrelated to the large proportion of lakes in Sweden and Finland, where the population density is low \n\nand there are large natural areas. The rivers are more evenly distributed throughout Europe with \n\na larger proportion of rivers in densely populated and cultivated areas in Central Europe. However, \n\nalso within countries lakes are generally reported to have better status than rivers (see chapter 4). \n\nThe worst water category is transitional waters, where 67% of the total number of water bodies or \n\n85 % of the total surface area is reported to be in less than good ecological status/potential. In coastal \n\nwaters, the situation is somewhat better with 49% of the total number or 44% of the total surface area \n\nreported to be in less than good ecological status or potential. The reason why transitional waters are \n\nso much worse than coastal waters is related to their proximity to land-based pollution sources, \n\nincluding accumulated loads of pollutants from rivers and coastal cities. Moreover, transitional waters \n\nare exposed to extensive hydromorphological pressures caused by land reclamation, flood protection, \n\nas well as large harbours causing altered habitats in these water bodies.  \n\nRivers and transitional waters are both worse as proportion of length or area than as proportion of \n\ntotal number (comparing the upper and lower panels of Fig. 5.1 for each water category), whereas for \n\nlakes and coastal waters the picture is the opposite. This means that for lakes and coastal waters the \n\nlarge water bodies are generally in a better status than the smaller ones, whereas the largest rivers and \n\ntransitional water bodies are in a worse status than the smaller ones. The reason for this difference \n\nmay be that the largest lakes and coastal waters have larger volumes of water and thus dilute the \n\npollution to a larger extent than smaller water bodies, whereas large rivers and transitional waters are \n\nsubject to more uses and are often located in areas with more pressures than the smaller ones.  \n\n5.3. Ecological status or potential in different river basin districts \n\nThe main differences in ecological status or potential between Member States / RBDs shown in Map \n\n5.1 below reflect the general situation in Europe, although there are some uncertainties in the details \n\n(see section 4.6). Further details on the basis of the assessment done by the different Member States \n\nare outlined in chapter 3 above. More information will become available in the Commission report in \n\nthe autumn of 2012 (EC, 2012b).  \n\nThe worst ecological status or potential in river and lake water bodies are reported in RBDs in \n\nNorthern Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders), where more than 90% are reported to be \n\nin less than good ecological status/potential (Map 5.1, see also chapter 4 for country specific results). \n\nOther problem areas are in Poland, Southern Germany, the Czech Republic, Southern England, \n\nNorthern France, Hungary, as well as several single RBDs in other Member States, where 70-90% of \n\nfreshwater bodies are reported to be in less than good status/potential. The ecological conditions are \n\nreported to be slightly better in the southern part of Germany compared to the northern part, probably \n\nreflecting the more mountainous landscape with lower population density, less industry and relatively \n\nless agricultural activity in combination with higher precipitation and deeper lakes (see case study in \n\nchapter 4.7). The map also illustrates the high variability in ecological conditions within single \n\nMember States, e.g. the UK, Italy and Spain, and shows that even in Member States with the majority \n\nof water bodies in good or better status, there are regions that are less good (e.g. the Bothnian Sea \n\nRBD in Finland, and the south Baltic and north Baltic RBDs in Sweden).  \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 81 \n\nMap 5.1 Proportion of classified surface water bodies in different River Basin Districts \nin less than good ecological status or potential for rivers and lakes (left \npanel) and for coastal and transitional waters (right panel)  \n\n \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS. \n\nFor coastal and transitional waters, the worst areas where more than 90% of the water bodies are \n\nreported to have less than good ecological status are in the Baltic region (Denmark, Southern Sweden, \n\na part of the Finnish coast, Lithuania, Poland and Germany) and in the Greater North Sea region \n\n(Denmark, north-western Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium (Flanders) and the south-eastern coast \n\nof the UK). Also in the EU part of the Black Sea (Romania, Bulgaria) the situation is poor with more \n\nthan 70% of classified water bodies reported to be in less than good ecological status or potential. \n\nThe best ecological status or potential in coastal and transitional waters in Europe are found in \n\nScotland and around the Mediterranean islands of Greece and Cyprus, as well as in the French part of \n\nthe Bay of Biscay, southern Portugal and in southern Italy, where more than 90% of the coastal and \n\ntransitional water bodies are reported to be in good or better ecological status or potential. The results \n\nreported from southern Italy are however quite uncertain, as the classified water bodies only constitute \n\n10% of all the transitional and coastal water bodies (see also section 4.6). Another area with large \n\nnumbers of water bodies in high and good status is the French coast of Brittany, the southern tip of \n\nGreece and most of the Spanish coast, including the Balearic Islands. Coastal waters in high status are \n\nalso in the Portugese overseas area \u2013 Macaronesia. \n\n5.4. Main pressures and impacts affecting ecological status for all water categories \n\n5.4.1. Water bodies without pressures and impacts \n\nThe proportion of water bodies with no identified pressures and impacts ranges from 20-50% in the \n\ndifferent water categories (Fig. 5.2).  \n\nThe water category with the lowest proportion of classified water bodies reported without significant \n\npressures is transitional waters (only 20%), followed by rivers (30%), coastal waters (40%) and lakes, \n\nwhere half of the classified water bodies are without significant pressures.  \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\n82 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nThe proportion of water bodies reported without significant impacts reflects the pattern shown for \n\nwater bodies without pressures in terms of differences between the water categories. Whereas only \n\n30% of the classified water bodies are reported without significant impacts in transitional waters, the \n\nsituation is better in rivers and coastal waters where half of the water bodies are reported without \n\nimpacts. Lakes are the best water category with as many as 60% of the classified water bodies \n\nreported without impacts.  \n\nThis pattern is consistent with the differences found between the water categories for ecological status \n\nor potential (see section 5.2 above). For all water categories there are slightly higher proportions of \n\nwater bodies reported without impacts than without pressures, suggesting that some of the pressures \n\nreported do not have significant impacts. Dilution of pollution loads, as well as resilience of aquatic \n\necosystems to pressures may partly explain why some of the water bodies exposed to significant \n\npressures do not show significant impacts. Reporting bias may also contribute to these differences. \n\n5.4.2. Pollution pressures and water quality impacts \n\nPollution pressures comprise all emissions to surface waters from point and diffuse sources, including \n\nnutrients, organic matter, acidifying substances and hazardous substances from local, regional or long\nrange trans-boundary pollution sources. \n\nIn general, lakes are reported to have less pollution pressures and water quality impacts than the other \n\nwater categories, corresponding to the pattern found for ecological status/potential (Fig. 5.1). This is \n\ntrue for Europe as a whole, as well as for most Member States (see chapter 4).  \n\nPollution pressures from diffuse sources are reported for a larger proportion of water bodies than \n\npollution from point sources for all the water categories, except transitional waters (see next \n\nparagraph). The proportion of classified water bodies reported to be exposed to significant diffuse \n\npollution ranges from one third in lakes and transitional waters to 40-45% in rivers and coastal waters \n\n(Fig. 5.2). The relatively low proportion of lake water bodies reported with diffuse pressures is caused \n\nby the high number of water bodies in Sweden and Finland located in remote areas with low \n\npopulation density and only small areas of intensive agriculture.  \n\n \n \n\nPoint source pollution is reported to be a significant pressure in more than 40% of the classified water \n\nbodies in transitional waters and in ca. 20-25% of rivers and coastal waters, but is less important in \n\nlakes (only 10%), due to improved urban waste water treatment during the past decades (more \n\ninformation in chapter 7). The high proportion of point source pollution reported for transitional \n\nwaters indicates that there are remaining challenges related to urban and industrial waste water in \n\nmany estuaries and coastal lagoons in Europe. \n\nThe most important impacts of these pollution pressures is nutrient enrichment causing eutrophication \n\n(Fig. 5.2). Coastal waters is the water category with the highest proportion of water bodies suffering \n\nfrom nutrient enrichment (42%), while lakes are the least affected water category with less than 20% \n\nreported to suffer from nutrient enrichment. For rivers and transitional waters 30% are reported to be \n\naffected by nutrient enrichment. As for diffuse pollution, the low proportion of lakes affected by \n\nnutrient enrichment is due to the high number of lakes found in the northern parts of Sweden and \n\nFinland. Organic enrichment is reported to affect between 10-15% of all classified water bodies in \n\nText Box 5.1 Reporting of Swedish mercury pollution \n\nAll Swedish surface water bodies have been reported to be affected by diffuse \n\npollution sources and impacted by contamination by priority substances due to \n\nmercury pollution. As this mercury pressure and impact may be less relevant \n\nfor the ecological status, and also prevent the comparison with other Member \n\nStates; the Swedish water bodies where the pressure and/or impact reporting is \n\nrelated to diffuse mercury pollution only, are redefined as unaffected.    \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 83 \n\nrivers, lakes and coastal waters, but is more important in transitional waters, where the proportion \n\nof affected water bodies is close to 30%. The latter is consistent with the high proportion of \n\ntransitional water bodies exposed to point source pollution. \n\nFigure 5.2 Percentage of total number of classified water bodies with identified \nsignificant pressures (left) and impacts (right) for a) rivers, b) lakes, c) \ntransitional waters, d) coastal waters \n\na) Rivers \n\n \nb) Lakes \n\n  \nc) Transitional waters \n\n  \nd) Coastal waters \n\n  \n\f\n84 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nNotes: The percentage is calculated against the total number of classified surface water bodies in Member \n\nStates reporting the specific pressure or impact type (or any pressure or impact for the blue bars).

Swedish surface water bodies where the pressure or impact reporting is considered only to \nbe related to airborne mercury contamination are defined as not affected by the relevant pressure or impact (see \ntext). See appendix for further details.  \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS and \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_IMPACT_STATUS. \n \n\n Acidification from long-range transported diffuse pollution is reported to affect 10% of river water \n\nbodies and 17% of lake water bodies in the Member States reporting this impact. Further information \n\non acidification status and trends are included in chapter 7. \n\nContamination by priority substances and contaminated sediments are seemingly minor impacts in all \n\nwater categories, affecting less than 20% of all classified water bodies, after excluding Sweden. The \n\nlow percentage may be an artefact of the choices made by Member States on how to assess chemical \n\nstatus in the first river basin management plan in terms of chosen substances, standards (old vs. new \n\nEQS directive) and matrices (water or biota or sediment). For further information, see chapter 6. \n\n5.4.3. Hydromorphological pressures and altered habitats \n\nHydromorphological pressures comprise all physical alterations of water bodies modifying their \n\nshores, riparian/littoral zones, water level and flow. Examples of such pressures are damming, \n\nembankment, channelization and non-natural water level fluctuations. \n\nHydromorphological pressures and altered habitats are reported for a large proportion of classified \n\nwater bodies, particularly in rivers (more than 40%) and transitional waters (40%) (Fig. 5.2). In lakes \n\naproximately one third of the classified water bodies are reported to be exposed to hydromorpological \n\npressures and 20% are reported to have altered habitats. A large part of the water bodies reported with \n\nthese pressures and impacts are heavily modified or artificial (see separate EEA/ETC report on \n\nHydromorphological alterations and pressures). In coastal waters, hydromorphological pressures and \n\naltered habitats are reported for a low proportion of classified water bodies (10%). The proportions of \n\nwater bodies exposed to hydromorphological pressures are almost the same as those having altered \n\nhabitats.  \n\nHydromorphological pressures and altered habitats are the most commonly occurring pressure and \n\nimpact in rivers, while in lakes and transitional waters these pressures and impacts are roughly as \n\ncommon as the pollution pressures and impacts. However, hydromorphological pressures and altered \n\nhabitats are sometimes affecting only a minor part of a water body (for example, physical shore-line \n\nalterations in lakes or barriers in rivers), and may thus have less serious ecological consequences than \n\npollution pressures, which often deteriorate the water quality of the whole water body.  \n\nMore information about hydromorphological pressures and altered habitats can be found in a separate \n\nthematic assessment report (EEA ETC/ICM, 2012 Hydromorphological alterations and pressures).  \n\n5.5. Main pressures and impacts in different river basin districts \n\n5.5.1. Pollution pressures \n\nThe highest pollution pressures in river and lake water bodies are reported in River Basin Districts \n\nin the Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders), as well as in southern Italy, south-eastern England, and \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 85 \n\nsmaller parts of northern Germany, where more than 90% of the water bodies are exposed to pollution \n\npressures (chapter 4 for country specific results). Other problem areas are in the rest of Germany \n\n(except the two RBDs in the southeastern and southwestern part), the Czech Republic, Southern \n\nEngland, Northern France, most of Ireland, southern Portugal, as well as several single RBDs in other \n\nMember States, where 70-90% of freshwater bodies are reported to be exposed to pollution pressures.  \n\nMap 5.2 Proportion of classified water bodies in different River Basin Districts \naffected by pollution pressures for rivers and lakes (left panel) and for coastal \nand transitional waters (right panel)  \n\n \nNotes: The percentage is based on total number of classified water bodies. A water body is defined as affected \n\nby pollution pressures if it is reported with the aggregated pressure type \u201cPoint sources\u201d and/or \u201cDiffuse sources\u201c \nand/or any of the corresponding disaggregated pressure types. Swedish surface water bodies where the \npressure reporting is considered only to be related to airborne mercury contamination are defined as not affected \nby pollution pressures (see text). See appendix for further details.  \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS. \n\nThe general overview of pollution pressures reported for different RBDs (Map 5.2) is largely \n\nconsistent with the results reported for ecological status or potential (Map 5.1). However, probably \n\ndue to the impact of hydromorphological pressures (Map 5.3), the ecological status or potential in \n\nrivers and lakes in some RBDs is worse than anticipated from the pollution pressures, such as in most \n\nof the RBDs in Northern Sweden, the Baltic countries, Scotland, Poland, Austria and Hungary, as \n\nwell as Brittany in France.  \n\nFor coastal and transitional waters, the worst areas where more than 90% of water bodies are \n\nreported to be exposed to pollution pressures are in the Baltic region (southern Finland, south-eastern \n\nSweden and north-eastern Germany), in the Greater North Sea region (south-western Sweden, north\nwestern Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders)), southern Portugal, as well as the \n\nRomanian part of the Black Sea region. In the Bulgarian part of the Black Sea 70-90% of their coastal \n\nand transitional water bodies are reported to be exposed to pollution pressures. Also along the coast \n\nof Brittany in France, eastern Ireland both sides of northern Italy, as well as south-western Portugal, \n\nmore than 70% of classified water bodies are reported to be exposed to pollution pressures. \n\nThe lowest proportion of coastal and transitional water bodies exposed to pollution pressures are \n\nreported from the north-eastern coast of Poland, as well as around the Greek islands, where more than \n\n90% of the coastal and transitional water bodies are reported to be without significant pollution \n\npressures.  \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\n86 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nFor coastal and transitional waters there is consistency between the reported pollution pressures and \n\nthe ecological status or potential. In some areas, however, the ecological status or potential in these \n\nwater categories is worse than what is suggested by the pollution pressures, e.g. in Poland, which can \n\nbe explained by hydromorphological or other pressures, as well as by pressures coming from outside \n\nthe EU. However, in other areas the ecological status or potential is better than what is suggested by \n\nthe pollution pressures, e.g. in Scotland, Brittany in France most of Italy and southern Portugal. The \n\nreason can be that the pollution pressures in these areas are rapidly diluted in large, exposed coastal \n\nwater bodies and therefore have less effect on their ecological status. However, also reporting \n\nmistakes and methodological artifacts may contribute to these inconsistencies (see chapter 3).  \n\n5.5.2. Hydromorphological pressures \n\nThe hydromorphological pressures in rivers and lakes are reported to be most severe in RBDs in the \n\nNetherlands, Germany, Poland, Hungary and south-east England, and less severe in RBDs in Finland, \n\nthe Baltic countries, Romania, as well as in many RBDs in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Bulgaria \n\nand Cyprus. In coastal and transitional waters the hydromorphological pressure is considerably less \n\nthan in freshwater bodies, and is mainly a problem along the Greater North Sea coast of Germany, the \n\nNetherlands and Belgium, as well as the in the southern coast of Italy. Further details on \n\nhydromorphological pressures can be found in the Hydromorphology Thematic Assessment report \n\n(EEA ETC/ICM, 2012). \n\nMap 5.3 Proportion of classified water bodies in different River Basin Districts \naffected by hydromorphological pressures for rivers and lakes (left panel) and \nfor coastal and transitional waters (right panel)  \n\n \nNotes: The percentage is based on total number of classified water bodies.

Relationships of ecological status or potential and pressures in rivers with \npopulation density and proportion of arable land  \n\nThis section takes a closer look at river water bodies.

The results provide a crude overview of the drivers and pressures affecting the ecological \n\nstatus. \n\nFigure 5.3 Ecological status and pressures in classified river water bodies in different \ncategories of population density (left panel) and arable land in the river \nbasin (right) \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNotes: Upper panel shows proportion of total number of classified river water bodies in different classes of \n\necological status or potential. Middle panel shows proportion of total number of classified river water bodies with \nand without pressures.

The designation of river water bodies to population or arable land \ncategories is made at RBD level, i.e. all water bodies in the same RBD are in the same category. The number of \nclassified river water bodies in the different population density categories or arable land categories is indicated in \nbrackets. In the pressure plots the Member States not reporting the given pressures are excluded from the \nnumber of classified water bodies. \u201cHydromorphology\u201d denotes the combination of the aggregated pressure types \n\u201cWater abstraction\u201d, \u201cWater flow regulations and morphological alterations of surface water\u201c, \u201cRiver management\u201c \nand \u201cOther morphological alterations\u201c. A water body is defined as affected by any of the pressure types in the \nfigures if it is reported with the aggregated pressure type and/or any of the corresponding disaggregated pressure \ntypes. Swedish surface water bodies where the pressure reporting is considered only to be related to airborne \nmercury contamination are defined as not affected (see text).

The ecological status or potential changes from less than \n\n40% to ca. 70% of classified river water bodies in less than good status, when population density and \n\nproportion of arable land increases from the lowest to the highest category. At the highest levels of \n\npopulation density and proportion of arable land (more than 200 inhabitants per km\n2\n and 40% arable \n\nland), one third of the river water bodies are reported to be in poor or bad ecological status or \n\npotential. At this highest level of the two major drivers, as much as 80-90% of the river water bodies \n\nare exposed to significant pressures, with diffuse pollution and hydromorphological alterations \n\naffecting 60-70% of the classified river water bodies. This pattern is a clear indication that population \n\ndensity and proportion of arable land are two major drivers responsible for the pressures affecting the \n\necological status or potential of European rivers.  \n\nHydromorphological pressures are reported for a substantial proportion of the classified river water \n\nbodies (30-40%) even at the lowest level of population density and proportion of arable land, which is \n\nprobably related to the use of many upstream rivers in mountain areas for hydropower production.  \n\n5.7. Appendix with notes for figures and tables. \n\nFigure 5.0  \n\nTable 5.0 Proportion of classified water bodies in less than good ecological status or potential, with \n\npressures and with impacts in different water categories. \n\nWater category Rivers Lakes Transitional \n\nwaters \n\nCoastal \n\nwaters \n\nEcological status or potential, % water bodies in \n\nless than good status or potential \n\n56 44 67 49 \n\nPressures, % water bodies with one or several \n\npressures \n\n68 52 80 59 \n\nImpacts, % water bodies with one or several \n\nimpacts \n\n52 39 68 52 \n\nEcological status or potential: Surface water bodies that are not classified include water bodies in \n\nsome RBDs which are not reported (see Map 5.1) and water bodies reported as unclassified (see \n\nchapter 3.1). The total numbers of classified water bodies are thus: Rivers: 91040, Lakes: 14755, \n\nTransitional waters: 712, Coastal waters: 2394. \n\nPressures and impacts: The Member States excluded from the number of total classified water bodies \n\ndue to non-reporting are: Pressures: Denmark, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Slovenia, Belgium and Cyprus \n\n(the latter two only for coastal waters). Impacts: Denmark, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Poland, the \n\nNetherlands, Slovenia, Belgium and Cyprus (the latter two only for coastal waters). Ireland only \n\nreported impacts for one RBD, so Irish water bodies are removed both from the number of water \n\nbodies with impacts and from the number of total classified water bodies in the impacts calculation. \n\nThe total numbers of classified water bodies included in the pressure and impact bars are thus: \n\nPressures: Rivers: 75405, Lakes: 13967, Transitional waters: 712, Coastal waters: 2281. \n\nImpacts: Rivers: 69656, Lakes: 12539, Transitional waters: 573, Coastal waters: 2201. \n\nFor Sweden, wherever the pressures or impacts reporting is related to airborne mercury pollution \n\nonly, the water bodies are considered not to be affected by pressures or impacts, respectively (see \n\nText Box 5.1). For pressures this occurs when the aggregated diffuse pressure type is the only \n\npressure and the impacts description indicates diffuse pollution from mercury only. For impacts this \n\noccurs when contamination by priority substances is the only impact (Sweden did not report the \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 89 \n\nimpact type \u2015contaminated sediments\u2016) and the impact description does not indicate contamination by \n\nother priority substances than mercury. The numbers of redefined water bodies are thus:  \n\nPressures: Rivers: 6441, Lakes: 3507, Transitional waters: 0, Coastal waters: 68. \n\nImpacts: Rivers: 11070, Lakes: 4903, Transitional waters: 0, Coastal waters: 93. \n\nFigure 5.1 \n\nIn cases where length (rivers) and area (remaining water categories) data were considered suspicious, \n\nthese water bodies were excluded from the analysis by length or area. These were cases when length \n\nor area was 0 or below or when data were not reported. This occurred in all water categories. In \n\naddition there were cases of unrealistically high numbers, indicating erroneous unit. For rivers, all \n\nwater bodies with length >1000 km were removed. These were all Italian. No lake or transitional \n\nwater bodies were removed due to too large area, but all coastal water bodies >6000 km\n2\n were \n\nremoved. These were all from the Spanish RBD ES100. The total numbers of classified water bodies \n\nused in the by length/area analysis were thus somewhat lower than in the analysis by count (see notes \n\nFig. 5.0), i.e.: \n\nRivers: 89260, Lakes: 14733, Transitional waters: 698, Coastal waters: 2350. \n\nFigure 5.2  \n\nFor the \u2015No pressures\u2016 and \u2015No impacts\u2016 bars, the same Member States are removed from the total \n\nnumber of classified water bodies as in Fig. 5.0. In the other bars, more Member States may be \n\nremoved from the total classified, if they have not reported that specific pressure or impact (for most \n\npressures and impacts these Member States can be identified in the member state plots in chapter 4). It \n\nis impossible to differentiate between Member States not reporting a specific pressure or impact, or \n\nMember States for which the specific pressure or impact is not affecting any water bodies. In the latter \n\ncase, removing these Member States leads to an overestimation of the proportion of water bodies \n\naffected by the specific pressure or impact.  \n\nFor the \u2015No pressures\u2016 and \u2015No impacts\u2016 bars, the same numbers of Swedish water bodies are \n\nredefined as in the pressures and impacts bars in Fig. 5.0, respectively. In the \u2015Diffuse sources\u2016 bars, \n\nSwedish water bodies reported with the aggregated diffuse pressure type as the only diffuse pressure \n\ntype and the impact description indicates diffuse mercury pollution only are redefined as not affected \n\nby diffuse pressures, that is: \n\nRivers: 11033, Lakes: 4895, Transitional waters: 0, Coastal waters: 89. \n\nIn the \u2015Contamination\u2016 bars, Swedish water bodies reported with the impact contamination by \n\npriority substances, but the impact description does not indicate contamination by other priority \n\nsubstances than mercury are redefined as not affected by the impact \u2015Contamination\u2016, that is: \n\nRivers: 14669, Lakes: 6915, Transitional waters: 16, Coastal waters: 389. \n\f\n90 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nMap 5.2 \n\nFor Sweden, water bodies are redefined as not affected by pollution pressures if the aggregated \n\ndiffuse pressure type is the only pollution type reported and the impact description indicates diffuse \n\nmercury pollution only (see notes Fig. 5.0).

The Member States removed from the number of \n\nclassified river water bodies in the pressure plots are the same as in Fig. 5.0 (for rivers, all Member \n\nStates reporting pressures overall report hydromorphological and diffuse pressures).

In the \u2015Diffuse sources\u2016 bars, Swedish water bodies reported \n\nwith the aggregated diffuse pressure type as the only diffuse pressure type and the impact description \n\nindicates diffuse mercury pollution only are redefined as not affected by diffuse pressures.

European overview of chemical status, \npressures and impacts \n\n6.1.  Key Messages  \n\nThe chemical status of more than 140 000 surface and groundwater bodies across Europe has been \n\nreported under the WFD. Including those water bodies classified with unknown status, poor status for \n\neach of the surface water body types \u2013 rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal does not exceed 10%, \n\naggregated across Europe as a whole, expressed by number of water bodies or \u2017count\u2018. Poor status for \n\ngroundwater, by area, is about 25% across Europe.  \n\nNotably, the chemical status of many of Europe\u2017s surface waters remains unknown, ranging between \n\n46% for coastal waters and 55% in transitional waters. In addition, understanding of the link between \n\npressures and chemical status remains incomplete.  \n\nSixteen Member States have more than 10% of groundwater bodies in poor chemical status whilst this \n\nfigure exceeds 50% in Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Belgium-Flanders and Malta. Excessive \n\nlevels of nitrate are the most frequent cause of poor groundwater status across much of Europe. \n\nAgriculture is the primary source of this nitrate, deriving from the input of mineral and organic \n\nfertilizers and subsequent leaching to groundwater. Pesticides and a range of other chemicals such as \n\nheavy metals are also causes of poor groundwater status across Europe. The threshold values to assess \n\ngroundwater chemical status vary markedly between Member States for certain pollutants.  \n\nTen Member States report poor chemical status in more than 20% of rivers and lakes, whilst in \n\nHungary, Belgium-Flanders, Denmark, Poland and Sweden this figure rises to above 40% and reaches \n\n100% in Sweden. These figures exclude, however, the many rivers and lakes across Europe with an \n\nunknown chemical status; unknown status exceeds 50% in 10 countries and 20% in all but 11 \n\ncountries. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a widespread cause of poor status in rivers. \n\nPAHs result from incomplete combustion processes and are subject to long-range transport in the \n\natmosphere. As a result, subsequent deposition and adverse impacts upon aquatic environments may \n\noccur a great distance from the original point of emission. Heavy metals are also a significant \n\ncontributor to poor status in rivers and lakes, with levels of mercury in Swedish freshwater biota being \n\nthe cause of 100% failure to reach good chemical status. Industrial chemicals such as the plasticiser \n\nDEHP, and pesticides, are also widespread causes of poor chemical status in rivers.  \n\nSix Member States \u2013 France, Germany, Belgium-Flanders, Sweden, Romania and the Netherlands - \n\nreport poor status in transitional waters (excluding those in unknown status) to be 50% or more. \n\nPAHs, the antifouling biocide tributyltin (TBT) and heavy metals are the most common cause. TBT is \n\nnow banned across Europe and high concentrations locally reflect the historical use and persistence of \n\nthis substance.  \n\nSix Member States report their coastal waters to be in 100% good status, although in five others \u2013 \n\nNetherlands, Sweden, Romania, Denmark and Belgium-Flanders poor status exceeds 90% of those \n\nwater bodies with a known chemical status. A variety of pollutant groups contribute to poor status in \n\ncoastal waters reflecting a diverse range of sources.  \n\nThose water bodies across Europe that exhibit particularly poor chemical status are, typically, subject \n\nto pollution from a range of different chemicals, including heavy metals, industrial chemicals and \n\npesticides that derive from a variety of sources.  \n\nSome hazardous substances tend to accumulate in sediment and biota, with the result that their \n\nconcentrations in these matrices are likely to be higher and, therefore, more detectable and measurable \n\f\n92 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nthan in water. If measurements are made in the water column, the risk to the aquatic environment may \n\nbe underestimated. At least one example exists of different matrices being used for the same chemical \n\nacross different Member States, resulting in assessments of chemical water quality that are not \n\ndirectly comparable. A harmonisation at EU level is, therefore, needed.  \n\n6.2.  Introduction \n\n6.2.1. Background \n\nChemicals are an essential part of our daily lives. They are used, for example, to produce consumer \n\ngoods, to protect or restore our health, to boost food production and are involved within a growing \n\nrange of environmental technologies. Europe's chemical and associated industries have developed \n\nrapidly in recent decades, making a significant contribution to Europe's economy and to the global \n\ntrade in chemicals. \n\nWhilst synthetic chemicals clearly bring important benefits to society, some of them are hazardous, \n\nraising concerns for human health and the environment depending on their pattern of use and the \n\npotential for exposure. Certain types of naturally occurring chemicals, such as metals, can also be \n\nhazardous. Emissions of hazardous substances to the environment can occur at every stage of their life \n\ncycle and arise from a wide range of land\u2010based and marine sources, including agriculture and \n\naquaculture, industry, oil exploitation and mining, transport, shipping and waste disposal, as well as \n\ndomestic premises. In addition, concern regarding chemical contamination arising from the \n\nexploitation of shale gas has grown recently. \n\nHazardous substances are emitted to water bodies both directly and indirectly through a range of \n\ndiffuse and point source pathways. Their presence in fresh and marine waters and associated biota and \n\nsediment is documented by various information sources, including national monitoring programmes, \n\nmonitoring initiatives undertaken by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), reporting under the Water \n\nFramework Directive (WFD), international marine conventions (e.g. HELCOM and OSPAR) and \n\nEuropean research studies. These substances comprise a wide range of industrial and household \n\nchemicals, metals, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. \n\nHazardous substances can have detrimental effects on aquatic biota at molecular, cellular, tissue, \n\norgan and ecosystem level. Substances with endocrine\u2010disrupting properties, for example, have been \n\nshown to impair reproduction in fish and shellfish in Europe, raising concerns for fertility and \n\npopulation survival. The impact of organo-chlorines upon sea birds and marine mammals is also well \n\ndocumented, as is the toxicity of metals and pesticides to freshwater biota. From a socio\u2010economic \n\npoint of view, such impacts diminish the services provided by aquatic ecosystems, and consequently \n\nthe revenue that can be derived from them. \n\nPersistent hazardous substances found in aquatic environments can bio\u2010accumulate and sometimes \n\nbio-magnify throughout the food chain, raising implications for human health with respect to the \n\nconsumption of seafood (fish, crustaceans, molluscs and marine mammals) and freshwater fish. The \n\nbio-accumulation and bio\u2010magnification of mercury and various POPs in particular can cause health \n\nconcerns for vulnerable population groups (EC, 2004; EFSA, 2005). The exceedance of regulatory \n\nlevels in seafood is documented for several hazardous substances in the seas around Europe (Isosaari \n\net al., 2006; Kiljunen et al., 2007; HELCOM, 2010b; Bilau et al., 2007). \n\nHuman exposure to hazardous substances can also potentially occur through the ingestion of \n\ncontaminated drinking water. The Drinking Water Directive sets quality standards for water at the tap, \n\nbased on guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), for a range of microbiological \n\nand chemical parameters. Much of Europe is now connected to municipal systems supplying treated \n\nwater under quality\u2010controlled conditions. However, reporting under the Directive (for the periods \n\n2002\u20132004 and 2005-2007) indicates some non\u2010 compliance with respect to a range of chemical \n\nparameters (EC, 2007; EC, 2011a). In recent years, concern has been raised with respect to the \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 93 \n\npresence of some emerging pollutants within treated municipal drinking water. Understanding of the \n\neffects of long\u2010term human exposure to trace amounts of such substances \u2014 in concentrations of parts \n\nper billion or trillion \u2014 remains incomplete.  \n\nIn some, typically rural, areas of Europe, the local population relies upon small individual or \n\ncommunity\u2010managed non\u2010piped supplies of water, usually wells or boreholes. Such small\u2010scale \n\nsupplies are not covered by the Drinking Water Directive and the provision of safe drinking water can \n\npresent a challenge: any chemical (or microbiological) pollution of groundwater in the vicinity of \n\nsuch wells will pose a threat to public health. The World Health Organization reports that chemical \n\ncontamination of drinking water across the (WHO) pan\u2010European region, whilst restricted to specific \n\nlocal areas, can have a significant impact upon human health (WHO, 2010).  \n\nThis assessment describes the chemical status of Europe\u2017s inland and coastal water bodies as reported \n\nthrough the river basin management plans of the WFD. It draws also on other supporting information, \n\nincluding chemical water quality data reported by voluntary agreement to the EEA by member \n\ncountries through the WISE-SoE reporting process and held in the Eionet database. In addition to \n\nhighlighting current chemical status, this assessment also describes the factors causing degradation in \n\nchemical water quality, including the sources of such pollution and their emissions to water.  \n\n6.2.2.  Sources, pathways and emissions  \n\nEmissions and releases of hazardous substances can occur at all stages of their life\u2010cycle, from \n\nproduction, processing, manufacturing and use in downstream production sectors and by the general \n\npublic to their eventual disposal. Such substances can arise from numerous sources and are emitted to \n\nfresh and marine waters via numerous pathways. The key sources and their pathways of emission are \n\noverviewed below.  \n\nUrban environment  \n\nHazardous substances arise from various sources in the urban environment. These include household \n\nchemicals such as personal care products and medicines, a wide range of industrial chemicals, \n\nsubstances such as hydrocarbons and heavy metals released by the transport sector, building and \n\nconstruction materials, and pesticides used to control unwanted plant growth on sports grounds and \n\nbuildings, in public parks and private gardens, and on roads and railways. Certain hazardous \n\nsubstances are released to air from industrial and waste facilities and vehicle emissions. Subsequently, \n\ntheir deposition to water bodies can occur both directly and indirectly, for example via soil and urban \n\ndrainage systems.  \n\nResidential wastewater in Europe is predominantly collected by a sewer network and directed to \n\nmunicipal wastewater treatment plants. Industrial wastewaters are also typically treated, either on\u2010site \n\nor by transfer to a municipal plant. Other urban pollutants, however, particularly those deposited from \n\nthe atmosphere or released from vehicles (e.g. from wear on brakes and tyres) are, originally at least, \n\ndiffuse in nature, as they are washed from impervious areas by surface run\u2010off. Their subsequent fate \n\ndepends upon whether the run\u2010off is collected and directed to a treatment plant or discharged \n\nuntreated to a receiving water body. Whilst household and industrial wastewater treatment has been \n\nimplemented progressively across Europe, the process does not remove all hazardous substances, with \n\nhousehold and industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals, for example, being detected in treated \n\neffluent that is subsequently discharged to surface waters (Ashton et al., 2004; Gros et al., 2010; \n\nHELCOM, 2010b; Mi\u00e8ge et al., 2009; Reemtsma et al., 2006).  \n\nIn many cities across Europe, the sewage collection system has also been designed to collect run\u2010off \n\nfrom streets, roofs and other impervious surfaces. The collection pipes and treatment plants of such \n\ncombined systems are designed to be able to handle both sewage and urban run\u2010off generated during \n\nrain storms, but only up to a certain level. During larger storm events, the combined flow generated \n\ncan exceed the capacity of the system. When this happens, relief structures are built into the collection \n\f\n94 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nsystem to prevent sewage back\u2010up into streets and homes, enabling the flows to bypass the treatment \n\nplants and discharge the combined waste more or less untreated to a receiving watercourse. Such \n\ncombined sewer overflows (CSOs), together with discharges from separate storm water systems, \n\ntypically discharge a range of pollutants including hazardous substances (Chon et al., 2010; Gounou \n\net al., 2011; Sally et al., 2011) and can cause rapid depletion of oxygen levels in receiving waters \n\n(Even et al., 2007). In addition, the quality of coastal waters near such discharges can deteriorate very \n\nquickly.  \n\nAgriculture  \n\nPesticides used in agriculture are widely detected in freshwater, often transported by diffuse pathways \n\nvia surface run\u2010off and leaching. Point discharges of pesticides are also important, however, and occur \n\nthrough accidental spillage, sprayer loading and wash\u2010down, and inappropriate storage and disposal. \n\nJust how much pesticide pollution of freshwater occurs depends on a range of factors including the \n\nchemical nature of the pesticide, the physical properties of the landscape, and weather conditions.  \n\nMetal emissions from agriculture include cadmium, found naturally in the phosphate rock used to \n\nmake fertilizer. In addition, both zinc and copper are added to animal feed as essential trace elements, \n\nand hence a proportion can be excreted and susceptible to being washed into rural streams. While \n\nmetals are generally well retained in soil, there is evidence that agricultural sources can make \n\na significant contribution to freshwater loads (RIVM, 2008a and 2008b).  \n\nFollowing use in livestock treatment, veterinary medicines and any metabolites may be released to \n\nsoil directly, by animals at pasture, or indirectly through the application of animal manures and \n\nslurries to land as a fertilizer (Boxall et al., 2004). As a consequence, veterinary medicines may \n\nsubsequently be transported to surface waters via runoff or field drains (Burkhard et al., 2005) \n\nor leach to groundwaters (Blackwell et al., 2007).  \n\nMining  \n\nMining exerts a localised but significant pressure upon the chemical and ecological quality of water \n\nresources in parts of Europe, particularly with respect to the discharge of heavy metals. Abandoned \n\nmines represent a particular threat since, in the absence of continued pumping, groundwater levels rise \n\nand, ultimately, discharge contaminants within the mine workings. Mine discharges threaten the \n\nattainment of good water quality in a number of locations across Europe.  \n\nLandfills and contaminated land  \n\nLandfill sites can be a source of pollution to the aquatic environment. Precipitation percolates down \n\nthrough the waste, picking up a range of pollutants including hazardous substances whilst water is \n\nalso released from the waste itself as it degrades (Slack et al., 2005). The leachate subsequently \n\ncollects at the base of the landfill where it can, potentially, contaminate groundwater. In modern \n\nlandfills, leachate is collected by pipes and either treated on site, with the effluent discharged to a \n\nneighbouring watercourse, or transported to a sewage treatment plant for processing. Older landfills, \n\nhowever, do not incorporate such measures and as a consequence, contaminated leachate is free to \n\nflow downwards unrestricted (Baun et al., 2004). Aside from landfill sites, land can be contaminated \n\nby a range of hazardous substances released from historical industrial activities or, more recently, \n\nfrom unintentional leaks and spills. Such substances can include solvents, oil, petrol, heavy metals \n\nand radioactive substances. Without appropriate remedial action, ground and surface waters can also \n\nbe polluted.  \n\nTransport of hazardous substances to coastal waters  \n\nOnce released to rivers, hazardous substances can be transported downstream and ultimately \n\ndischarged to coastal waters, although numerous processes can occur 'in\u2010stream' to attenuate this \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 95 \n\ntransport. Of particular note is the deposition of substances onto the river bed. Hazardous substances \n\nattached to other particles, such as organic material and eroded soil, are particularly susceptible to this \n\nsedimentation process and, once settled on the river bed, can pose a threat to benthic biota. During \n\nperiods of higher river flow, however, bed sediments and their associated contaminants can be \n\nre\u2010suspended into the water column and transported downstream until flow declines and \n\nsedimentation occurs again. The proportion of a hazardous substance load that is ultimately \n\ndischarged to estuarine and coastal waters remains susceptible to sedimentation once more. \n\nRe\u2010suspension of hazardous substances can also occur when sediments are disturbed and displaced, \n\nfor example, through dredging.  \n\nSources emitted directly into the marine environment  \n\nIn addition to the waterborne transport of substances emitted from land\u2010based sources and deposition \n\nfrom the atmosphere, hazardous substances are also released directly into the marine environment. \n\nShipping, harbour and port activities, offshore oil exploration and aquaculture all emit a variety of \n\nhazardous substances, whilst the discharge of sewage and industrial wastewater directly (i.e. not via \n\nrivers) into coastal waters can also occur. \n\n6.2.3.  Protection of Europe\u2019s fresh and marine waters from chemical pollution \n\nThe chemical status of Europe's surface waters is addressed by the Directive on environmental quality \n\nstandards (EQSD) a 'daughter' directive of the WFD. The EQSD defines environmental quality \n\nstandards (EQSs) in fresh and coastal waters for pollutants of EU\u2010wide relevance known as priority \n\nsubstances (PSs). The EQSs associated with the PSs are defined both in terms of annual average and \n\nmaximum allowable concentrations, with the former protecting against long\u2010term chronic pollution \n\nproblems and the latter against short\u2010term acute pollution. Member States are required to monitor the \n\nPSs in surface water bodies, to report EQS exceedances and implement measures to address them. PSs \n\ndesignated thus far include metals, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, biocides, volatile organic \n\ncompounds, alkylphenols, PAHs and phthalates. The European Commission is required to review the \n\nlist of PSs every four years and identify, where appropriate, new PSs or PHSs and any need to revise \n\nthe EQSs or the status of existing PSs.  \n\nThe EQSs must not only protect freshwater and marine ecosystems from possible adverse effects of \n\nhazardous substances; they must also safeguard human health, which potentially can be put at risk via \n\ndrinking water or the ingestion of food originating from aquatic environments. In this way, all direct \n\nand indirect exposure routes in aquatic systems are to be accounted for when establishing the EQSs. \n\nFor example, the setting of an EQS for the water column alone may be insufficient with respect to a \n\nchemical with a tendency to bio-accumulate and bio-magnify and one that may therefore pose a risk \n\nthrough secondary poisoning resulting from food chain transfer. Instead, in this case, a biota standard \n\nmay be required alongside the water column EQS.  \n\nSome pollutants have been designated as priority hazardous substances (PHSs) due to their toxicity, \n\ntheir persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in plant and animal tissues, or an equivalent \n\ncause for concern. The cessation or phase\u2010out of discharges, emissions and losses of PHSs to the \n\naquatic environment is required within 20 years of the date of the adoption of measures.  \n\nFor substances identified as being of concern at local, river\u2010basin or national level (known as river \n\nbasin specific pollutants) but not as a PS or PHS at EU level, standards are set by national \n\ngovernments and the results of monitoring are considered in the assessment of ecological status under \n\nthe WFD.  \n\nThe WFD objectives for groundwater are laid down in Article 4 of the Directive, which requires \n\nMember States to implement the measures necessary to prevent or limit the input of pollutants into \n\ngroundwater and to prevent the deterioration of the status of all groundwater bodies. Any significant \n\f\n96 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nand sustained upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant resulting from human activity must \n\nbe reversed.  \n\nThe Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC; GWD) establishes a regime to assess groundwater \n\nchemical status, providing EU-wide groundwater quality standards in Annex I (for nitrates and \n\npesticides) and requiring Member States to establish groundwater quality standards (referred to as \n\n\u2015threshold values\u2016) at a national level for a range of other pollutants, as identified in Annex II of the \n\nGWD. The overall approach to this incorporates the risks identified by the analysis of pressures and \n\nimpacts under article 5 of the WFD and accounts for the high natural variability of substances in \n\ngroundwater due to various factors including hydrogeology, background levels and pollutant \n\npathways. The groundwater thresholds are primarily based on two criteria, the protection of \n\nassociated aquatic ecosystems and groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems, and the protection \n\nof water used for drinking purposes and other legitimate uses. Good groundwater chemical status is \n\nnot, however, only dependent upon the non-exceedance of quality standards but upon a number of \n\nfurther elements, including the requirement, for example, that there is no saline intrusion into a \n\ngroundwater body, and that concentrations in groundwater do not result in failure of status of \n\nassociated surface waters nor any significant deterioration of the ecological or chemical quality of \n\nsuch bodies nor in any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems which depend directly on the \n\ngroundwater body. \n\nA suite of other European legislation lends support to the attainment of good chemical status under \n\nthe WFD. This includes REACH (EC Regulation 1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, \n\nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) which aims to improve the protection of human health \n\nand the environment from the risks of chemicals. REACH attributes greater responsibility to industry \n\nwith regard to managing risks and providing safety information on substances used. It also calls for \n\nthe progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals once suitable alternatives have been \n\nfound. Other legislation is specific to a particular substance or group of substances. This includes the \n\nPesticides Framework Directive which calls for the establishment of national action plans to set \n\nobjectives in order to reduce hazards, risks and dependence on chemical control for plant protection. \n\n6.2.4. Chemical Status \u2013 reporting requirements \n\nSurface Water  \n\nWFD reporting guidance proposed that Member States grouped the reporting of priority substances \n\ninto four categories; heavy metals, pesticides, industrial pollutants and \u2017other pollutants\u2017. The latter \n\ncategory included a mix of individual chemical types including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n\n(PAHs) and tributyltin compounds. Inconsistency in reporting was apparent between Member States, \n\nhowever, with some reporting a mix of pollutant groups and individual pollutants, whilst others \n\nreported either individual pollutants or groups only. Moreover, different matrices (i.e. water column, \n\nsediment and biota) have sometimes been used to assess the risk of particular chemicals across \n\ndifferent Member States, meaning that the results arising are not always directly comparable.  \n\nGroundwater  \n\nReporting with respect to WFD groundwater chemical status required a grouping into three \n\ncategories; nitrate, certain pesticides and the Annex II pollutants covering arsenic, cadmium, lead, \n\nmercury, ammonium, chlorides, sulphates, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Inconsistency in \n\nreporting was apparent between Member States, however, with some reporting a mix of pollutant \n\ngroups and individual pollutants, whilst others reported either individual pollutants or groups only. \n\nMoreover, the definition of pollutants and their associated threshold values (as required under the \n\nGWD) vary markedly between Member States (EC, 2010a).  \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 97 \n\n6.3. European overview of chemical status \n\nThe chemical status of 123213 surface freshwater bodies (104176 rivers and 19037 lakes) has been \n\nevaluated across 26 Member States across Europe, with 43% of rivers and 44% of lakes (by count) \n\nbeing classified as good, and 6% and 2%, respectively, being in poor status (Fig. 6.1). Notably, the \n\nchemical status of 51% of rivers and 54% of lakes remain unknown. These overall statistics do not, \n\nhowever, include the results from Sweden that contributed a disproportionately large amount to the \n\ntotal information reported across Europe for surface waters. Additionally all such waters in Sweden \n\nare classified as being in poor status due to the levels of mercury found in biota (see textbox).  \n\nText Box 6.1 Importance of the matrix used to evaluate chemical status  \n\nSome hazardous substances tend to accumulate in sediment and biota, with the result that their \n\nconcentrations in these matrices are likely to be higher and therefore, more detectable and \n\nmeasurable than in the water column. If measurements are made in the water column only, the risk \n\nto the aquatic environment may be underestimated. The high levels of mercury in freshwater biota \n\nin Sweden, for example has led to a nationwide classification of poor chemical status. WFD \n\nreporting shows, however, that at least one other Member State has monitored mercury levels in \n\nthe water column only. This has resulted in a substantially lower percentage of water bodies being \n\nclassified in poor chemical status compared to Sweden, despite a comparable problem with \n\nmercury in soils and freshwater. \n\nChemical status for 1010 transitional and 3027 coastal water bodies has been reported across 16 and \n\n21 Member States, respectively. Marked variation in the surface area of these is apparent both within \n\nand between Member States, although since this information was not reported consistently, the results \n\nare presented here by count. Poor chemical status is reported in 10% of transitional and 4% of coastal \n\nwater bodies, (excluding data from Sweden) whilst good status is achieved in 35% and 51%, \n\nrespectively. Of note is the amount of unknown status reported, 55% of transitional and 46% of \n\ncoastal water bodies are classified in this category.  \n\nThe chemical status of more than 13 000 groundwater bodies has been reported across Europe, \n\nencompassing 26 different Member States. Good chemical status is apparent in 72% of them (by \n\nsurface area) whilst about 25% are in poor status (Fig. 6.1). Approximately 3% are classified as \n\nunknown. The dominant reason for poor status (62% by area, 60% by count) is the exceedance of a \n\nquality standard (threshold value) for one or more pollutants. Other important causal factors include \n\nthe deterioration in quality of waters for human consumption (21% by area, 11% by count) (Table \n\n6.1).\n\f\n98 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nFigure 6.1 Percentage of rivers, lakes, groundwater, transitional and coastal waters in \ngood, poor and unknown chemical status  \n\n \nNotes: Number of Member States contributing to the dataset: Groundwater (26); Rivers (25); Lakes (22); \n\nTransitional (15) and Coastal (20).

The total number of water bodies is \nshown in parenthesis. Data from Sweden are excluded from surface water data illustrated in the figure.

Chemical groups causing poor status \u2013 an overview  \n\nExcessive nitrate concentration is the cause of 54% of those groundwater bodies classified as being in \n\npoor chemical status across Europe, whilst the GWD Annex II pollutants account for 34%. It should \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/GWB_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 99 \n\nbe noted; however, that more than one chemical group can cause failure to reach good status in any \n\nsingle water body. Pesticides are the cause of 20% of groundwater bodies in poor chemical status. \n\nIn general, shallow groundwater horizons are more likely to exhibit poor chemical status than deeper \n\nhorizons.  \n\n\u2017Other pollutants\u2017 are the causal factor for nearly 52% of European rivers classified as being in poor \n\nchemical status, whilst heavy metals account for 20% and pesticides about 16%. These figures do not, \n\nhowever, include data from Sweden for the reasons outlined earlier. For lakes, heavy metals are the \n\ndominant pollutant, accounting for more than 60% of those in poor status. \u2017Other pollutants\u2017 are the \n\ncausal factor for 57% of those transitional water bodies classified as being in poor chemical status, \n\nwhilst heavy metals account for 43%. Pesticides and industrial pollutants each account for 16% \n\nand 20% respectively. In coastal waters, \u2017other pollutants\u2017 account for 53% of water bodies in poor \n\nstatus, followed by heavy metals accounting for 50% and industrial pollutants that account for 19%. \n\n6.4. National and River Basin District Chemical Status  \n\n6.4.1. Groundwater \n\nOnly Latvia and Lithuania report 100% of groundwater bodies to be in good chemical status whilst 16 \n\nMember States have more than 10% in poor status, by area. In Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, \n\nBelgium-Flanders and Malta, more than 50% of groundwater bodies are in poor status, by area. \n\n(Fig. 6.2, Map 6.1). Few groundwater bodies across Europe remain in unknown status, although \n\naround 20% in Slovakia and Italy and 100% in Greece are classified in this category.  \n\nNitrates, chlorides, ammonium, pesticides, arsenic and sulphates are widespread groundwater \n\npollutants and each contributes to poor chemical status in more than 12 countries (Table 6.2). \n\nExcessive nitrate concentration is either the sole factor or a contributing one in all but one (Estonia) \n\nof those Member States that report some (>0%) poor status in groundwater, and is the major cause \n\nof failure to reach good status in 12 countries \u2013 Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, \n\nDenmark, Spain, Italy, Malta, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania and the UK. Whilst excessive nitrate \n\nconcentration accounts for between 10% and 30% of poor groundwater status across much of Europe \n\n(by area), this figure rises to more than 30% (and in some cases greater than 50%) in certain locations, \n\nincluding the Belgian Maas RBD, the Catalan, Tagus and some southern coastal river basins in Spain, \n\nthe Loire in France, central and eastern England, the Ems, Maas and Weser RBDs in Germany, all 3 \n\nRBDs in the Czech Republic and across Bulgaria. Groundwater nitrate is primarily attributable to \n\nagricultural sources (see textbox). The wide extent of high groundwater nitrate in Europe that is \n\napparent from WFD reporting is also broadly reflected by data reported to the EEA under WISE-SoE, \n\nwhich shows that a number of countries have a proportion of groundwater bodies with nitrate \n\nconcentrations in excess of 50mg/l (EEA, 2010b). A similar conclusion and spatial pattern of nitrate \n\nlevels is also drawn from reporting under the Nitrate Directive (EC, 2010a).  \n\f\n100 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nFigure 6.2 Percentage of groundwater bodies in poor and good status, by area  \n\n \nNotes: Groundwater bodies in unknown status are not accounted for in the red and blue bars that represent the \n\npercentage poor and good status respectively.

Denmark \n\nand Slovenia did not report the area of groundwater bodies, whilst 164 of 385 (43%) Danish groundwater bodies \nwere reported in poor chemical status and 4 of 21 (19%) Slovenian groundwater bodies were reported in poor \nchemical status. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/GWB_STATUS. \n\nIn France pesticides is the most significant causal factor of poor chemical status in groundwater, \n\ncontributing to failure to achieve good chemical status in at least 30% of the classified groundwater \n\nbodies (by area) in all RBDs, with this figure rising to more than 50% in the Seine RBD. Pesticides \n\nare also problematic in the Ems RBD in Northern Germany and the Mino-Sil RBD in northern Spain. \n\nPesticides contribute to failure to achieve good chemical status in between 5 and 15% of the classified \n\ngroundwater bodies (by area) across much of central and eastern Europe, together with Italy, England, \n\nsouthern Sweden, southern Finland and coastal groundwater in southern Spain. WFD reporting \n\nindicates that despite now being banned, the triazine pesticides, atrazine and simazine, are the most \n\ncommonly identified individual pesticides in groundwater across all Member States. Triazine \n\npesticides are of particular concern with regard to freshwaters due to a number of their properties \n\nincluding a relatively high water solubility, persistence and low soil adsorption. Notably, reporting \n\nunder WISE-SoE suggests that the presence of atrazine and simazine (and their transformation \n\nproducts) in groundwater is more widespread across Europe than is indicated through WFD reporting \n\n(see a comparison of Map 6.1 and Map 6.3) In Belgium-Flanders, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/GWB_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 101 \n\nIreland, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovakia, the Annex II pollutants are the most frequent cause of \n\npoor status in groundwater.

While nitrogen fixation, atmospheric \n\ndeposition and the application of treated sewage sludge can all be important, the major nitrogen \n\ninputs to agricultural land are generally from inorganic mineral fertilisers and organic manure from \n\nlivestock. Today, the highest total fertiliser nitrogen application rates \u2014 mineral and organic \n\ncombined \u2014 generally, although not exclusively, occur in Western Europe. Ireland, England and \n\nWales, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, north-western and southern Germany, \n\nthe Brittany region of France and the Po valley in Italy all have high nitrogen inputs (Grizzetti et \n\nal., 2007; Bouraoui et al., 2011). Application rates are generally in excess of what is required by \n\ncrops and grassland, resulting in a nitrogen surplus (Grizzetti et al., 2007). The magnitude of the \n\nsurplus reflects the potential for detrimental impacts on the environment since it is available for \n\ngaseous loss to the atmosphere as ammonia, transport to the nearest surface water body or, \n\nleaching to groundwater as nitrate. It is the process of leaching of nitrate that gives rise to the poor \n\ngroundwater chemical status illustrated above. Improvement in groundwater nitrate water quality \n\nwill take considerable time because of transport processes in soils and groundwater and the \n\nrenewal rate of groundwater which can be substantial. As a result, reported timescales for \n\nrestoration of water quality reflect this time lag, ranging from 4\u20138 years in Germany and Hungary \n\nto several decades for deep groundwater in the Netherlands (EC, 2010b). This time lag is a key \n\nreason why some groundwater bodies may not achieve good status by 2015 or later even if all \n\nnecessary measures are implemented soon by Member States. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/GWB_STATUS\f\n104 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nThe concentrations of triazine pesticides in groundwater reported under the WISE-SoE data flow are \n\nexceeding the threshold limits for several substances in France, Belgium, Denmark, UK and the \n\nCzech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Slovenia, while two of these substances are exceeding threshold \n\nlimits in Germany, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Serbia. Atrazine is the only triazine pesticide exceeding \n\nlimit values in Lithuania and in Cyprus. Ireland reports no exceedance of any of the triazine pesticide \n\nsubstances. This pattern corresponds roughly to the countries exceeding nitrate limit values in \n\ngroundwater shown above.  \n\nMap 6.2 Triazine pesticides in groundwater between 2003 and 2008 as reported under \nWISE-SoE \n\n \nSource: EEA, 2011b. \n\n6.4.2.

Detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS. \n\nExcluding data for Sweden to avoid a distortion of results indicates that the \u2018other pollutants\u2017 group is \n\nthe most frequent overall cause of poor status in rivers (18 Member States identified this group as \n\nproblematic), but particularly in Belgium-Flanders, Germany, France and the UK. A substantial \n\nnumber of rivers also fail to reach good status due to this pollutant group in the Czech Republic, \n\nNetherlands and Romania. Within the \u2017other pollutant\u2017 grouping, PAHs (especially \n\nbenzo(g,h,i)perylene and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene) are identified as being problematic by eleven \n\nMember States including most of the RBDs in France, all of the UK RBDs except for Scotland, the \n\nBelgian Schelde and the Czech and German parts of the Elbe. Moreover, assessment of the WISE\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 107 \n\nSoE data suggests that the issue of PAHs in rivers is even more widespread across Europe than that \n\nindicated by WFD reporting. PAHs result from incomplete combustion processes such as those \n\nrelated to the production of electricity, the transport sector, various industrial sectors and waste \n\nincineration. They are released to the atmosphere and are known to be subject to long-range \n\ntransboundary atmospheric transport. As a result, subsequent deposition and adverse impacts upon \n\naquatic environments may occur a great distance from the original point of emission, including remote \n\nmountainous regions. Addressing the impacts of such pollutants requires political initiative at the \n\nregional and global scale. \n\nTributyltin (TBT), used primarily as an anti-fouling biocide for boats and ships, is one of those \u2017other \n\npollutants\u2017 identified as problematic by ten Member States. Despite now being banned in Europe, \n\nhigh levels in rivers are found locally, reflecting the historical use and persistence of this substance. \n\nTBT is a particular issue in the Belgium-Schelde, the Rhone in France and the Humber and Thames \n\nRBDs in the UK.  \n\nMap 6.3 Chemical status of rivers and lakes and transitional and coastal waters per \nRBD \u2013 percentage of water bodies not achieving good chemical status are \nshown \n\n \nNotes: Surface water bodies in unknown status are not included in calculation of the percentage of poor \n\nchemical status. River Basin Districts with a high proportion of water bodies with unknown chemical status are \nhatched.  \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012. Detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS. \n\nHeavy metals are identified as problematic by 21 Member States, and are the dominant cause of poor \n\nstatus in rivers across twelve Member States, but markedly so in Sweden, Denmark, Bulgaria, the \n\nCzech Republic, Spain, Finland, Northern and Central Italy and Romania. In the Czech Republic, for \n\nexample, nickel, cadmium, lead and mercury are problematic in all three RBDs \u2013 the Danube, Elbe \n\nand Oder, whilst nickel contributes to poor status in four UK RBDs \u2013 the Humber, South West, \n\nSevern and Western Wales. Heavy metals are also a significant cause of poor status in the German \n\nRhine. Fifteen Member States highlight cadmium as a cause of poor status. Due to its threat to both \n\nenvironmental and human health cadmium is classified as a priority hazardous substance. Cadmium is \n\nprimarily produced as a by\u2010product from the extraction, smelting and refining of zinc and other \n\nnon\u2010ferrous metals, although it is also found in phosphate rock used to manufacture fertilizer. \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\n108 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nEmissions of cadmium to water occur, therefore, via both diffuse and point source pathways. Mercury \n\nis also a priority hazardous substance and is identified as problematic in 13 Member States. The \n\nexceedance of regulatory levels of mercury in aquatic biota is the cause of 100% poor status in \n\nSwedish rivers and lakes. Mercury is also a major issue in the Slovak Republic part of the Danube \n\nRiver, the Czech Republic and Northern and Central Italy.  \n\nIndustrial Pollutants are the predominant reason for poor chemical status in rivers within Estonia, \n\nLithuania and the Slovak Republic but are a significant factor in a number of others including \n\nBelgium-Flanders, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, \n\nSweden and the UK. Within this group, DEHP, widely used as a plasticiser (see textbox 6.3) is \n\nidentified by eight Member States as being problematic. DEHP is a particular issue in the Danube \n\nRBD in the Slovak Republic and the Meuse, Rhine and Loire RBDs in France. Octylphenol, used as \n\nan intermediate in the production of chemicals used in rubber, pesticides and paints, causes poor \n\nchemical status in Belgium-Flanders, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain and Sweden. Nonylphenol, \n\nan industrial surfactant and a known endocrine disruptor, contributes to poor status in 12 RBD\u2017s in \n\nseven Member States across Europe and is a particular problem in rivers of the Belgium Scheldt and \n\nthe Catalan RBD in Spain.  \n\nPesticides are the predominant cause of poor chemical status in rivers in Luxembourg, whilst a \n\nsubstantial number of water bodies also fail to reach good status due to pesticides in France, Belgium\nFlanders, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and the \n\nUK. Overall, pesticides contribute to poor status in 16 Member States. Diuron is identified as a cause \n\nof poor status in seven Member States including the North West and Thames RBDs in the UK, the \n\nBelgium Scheldt, Guadalquivir in Spain and the Seine in France. Whilst diuron has been banned as an \n\nactive substance in plant protection products across most of Europe, it is still widely used as a biocide \n\nagent in construction materials and cooling systems. Other problematic pesticides identified include \n\nthe herbicides alachlor and isoproturon, which together contribute to poor status in eleven Member \n\nStates, whilst the banned organochlorine insecticides \u2013 endosulfan and hexachlorocyclohexane cause \n\npoor status in four and six Member States respectively, with the former being a particular issue in the \n\nEbro RBD (Spain). The triazine herbicide atrazine, also banned EU wide, contributes to poor status in \n\n5 Member States. \n\nThose RBD\u2017s illustrating particularly poor riverine chemical status are generally subject to pollution \n\nby a range of different chemicals. This is the case, for example, in the German Rhine where \u2017other \n\npollutants\u2017, pesticides and heavy metals each cause poor status in more than 100 water bodies and \n\nindustrial chemicals contribute to poor status in 14 water bodies. Similarly, 14 different chemicals \n\ncontribute to poor status in the Jucar RBD in Spain. Poor chemical status is relatively high across the \n\nPolish Oder RBD although the causes are not reported. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 109 \n\nText Box 6.3 Emissions of DEHP to water  \n\n \nSource: EEA, 2011b. \n\n \n\nDi(2\u2010ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is an organic compound classified as a Priority Substance under \n\nthe WFD and as a substance of very high concern under REACH. It is used as a plasticiser in polymer \n\nproducts (mainly in flexible PVC) including pipes and tubes, flooring and wall lining, sealants, food \n\npackaging, cables and wire sheathing, under-seal for cars, guttering, tarpaulins, clothing and footwear, \n\ntoys, office supplies and medical products such as blood bags and catheters. The content of DEHP in \n\npolymer products varies but typically approximates 30%, although it migrates slowly from such \n\nproducts over their lifetime. A proportion of the DEHP released to the aquatic environment stems \n\nfrom discharge of effluent from municipal sewage treatment plants, deriving originally from the wide \n\nuse of PVC in residential, commercial, medical and industrial premises and their direct connection to \n\na sewer system. DEHP is also released into urban run\u2010off. In this case, it originates from building \n\nmaterials and vehicles and is subsequently discharged to a water body directly or indirectly, via a \n\nmunicipal treatment plant. Storm water overflows are also a significant emission pathway (OSPAR, \n\n2009). Data reported to the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry (E-PRTR) and mapped \n\nabove, show that 17.9 tonnes of DEHP were emitted to water from 180 facilities in 2008, 97% of \n\nwhich was emitted via 143 urban wastewater treatment plants. However, given its widespread use and \n\nthe high likelihood of DEHP discharges from all large municipal wastewater treatment plants, the map \n\nabove suggests that reporting under E\u2010PRTR is incomplete. Estimates from other sources indicate that \n\ndiffuse emissions \u2014 not reported under E\u2010PRTR \u2014 are also a significant source of DEHP (OSPAR, \n\n2009).  \n\f\n110 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nData reported for lakes is relatively limited across Europe with the exception of Sweden. Eight \n\nMember States report 100% good chemical status in lakes whilst in a further seven Member States \n\npoor status applies to less than 10%. Poor chemical status of 10% or greater is only observed in lakes \n\nin Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Romania and Sweden.  \n\nTable 6.4 Number of lake water bodies in poor chemical status due to given pollutants \nin Member States \n\nPollutants CY CZ DE FI FR IT NL PT RO SE UK\n\nHeavy metals - aggregated (3/59) 1 6 52\n\nCadmium (4/121) 3 1 75 42\n\nLead (4/78) 2 1 63 12\n\nMercury (5/7256) 1 3 9 11 7232\n\nNickel (4/60) 1 1 1 57\n\nPesticides - aggregated (2/12) 7 5\n\nTrifluralin (1/1) 1\n\nIsoproturon (1/1) 1\n\nHexachlorocyclohexane (1/1) 1\n\nIndustrial Pollutants - aggregated (2/8) 4 4\n\nNonylphenol (2/5) 3 2\n\nBrominated diphenylether (1/1) 1\n\nDi(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) (1/4) 4\n\nOther pollutants - aggregated (2/45) 1 44\n\nPentachlorophenol (1/2) 2\n\nPolyaromatic hydrocarbons - unspecified (1/3) 3\n\nBenzo(a)pyrene (1/1) 1\n\nBenzo(b)fluoranthene (1/1) 1\n\nBenzo(g,h,i)perylene (1/8) 8\n\nIndeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene (1/8) 8\n\nTributyltin compounds (4/11) 1 3 1 6\n\nFluoranthene (1/7) 7  \nNote: Number of Member States / number of water bodies is shown in parenthesis. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012.

TBT contributes to poor status in the lakes of Finland, France, Portugal and Sweden. \n\nA recent survey of PAH levels in mountain lakes in Europe showed total concentrations in all lakes \n\nmonitored to be above the no-effects threshold (Quiroz et al., 2010).

TBT is one of those \n\n\u2017other pollutants\u2017 identified as problematic and is the main cause of poor status in transitional waters \n\nin the Thames, Anglian, Humber, Northumbria, Southwest and Northwest RBDs of the UK, and is a \n\ncontributing factor in others, including the Belgium-Schelde, the Nemunas in Lithuania, the North and \n\nSouth Baltic RBDs of Sweden and the Loire in France. PAHs contribute to poor status in transitional \n\nwaters in Romania, France and Belgium.  \n\nHeavy metals are the most frequently reported cause of poor status in Sweden and Spain but are \n\na particular issue in the Tinto-Odiel-Piedras RBD with mining discharges being the primary cause. \n\nMercury is a cause of poor status in Swedish transitional waters, although the problem is not as \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 113 \n\nwidespread as for Swedish freshwaters and is limited in transitional waters to the Skagerrak and \n\nKattegat, and North Baltic Sea RBDs. In France, heavy metals cause poor status in transitional waters \n\nof the Rhone, Loire and Seine RBDs. Heavy metals are also problematic in the Northern Apennines \n\nRBD in Italy and the Romanian Danube. \n\nSome industrial pollutants are also identified as a cause of poor status in transitional waters. DEHP, \n\nfor example, is a cause of poor status in the Rh\u00f4ne and Loire RBDs in France and the Nemunas RBD \n\nin Lithuania, whilst nonylphenol is identified as problematic in transitional waters of Portugal and \n\nBelgium. In Irish transitional waters, brominated diphenylether causes poor chemical status.  \n\nThose transitional waters with the poorest chemical quality across Europe are typically subject to \n\npollution from a range of individual pollutants. The Seine in France, for example, reports heavy \n\nmetals, pesticides and PAHs to be an issue, whilst in the Belgium-Schelde, 12 chemicals including \n\nmercury, pesticides, PAHs, TBT and the industrial chemical nonylphenol are all a cause of poor \n\nstatus. Similarly, the Romanian part of the Danube RBD is polluted by the heavy metals - cadmium, \n\nlead and nickel - a range of PAHs and some pesticides.  \n\nExcluding those in unknown status, six Member States report their coastal waters to be in 100% good \n\nchemical status, although 5 \u2013 the Netherlands, Sweden, Romania, Denmark and Belgium-Flanders \n\nindicate that poor status exceeds 90% (Map 6.2, Map 6.5).

Despite some uncertainties in the data and \n\nthe need for caution in interpretation, downward trends are detected for all five substances as regards their total \n\ninputs to the OSPAR region. For example, statistically significant downward trends in combined riverine inputs \n\nand direct discharges of mercury to the Greater North Sea and Celtic Sea regions, of about 75% and 85% \n\nrespectively, are reported for the period 1990\u20132006. These trends observed in the OSPAR regions are \n\nattributable to a decline in emissions to water, both through the implementation of best available abatement \n\ntechniques at industrial facilities and improvements in municipal wastewater treatment (OSPAR, 2009). \n\n6.5.  Conclusions \n\nThe chemical status of more than 140 000 surface and groundwater bodies across Europe has been \n\nreported under the WFD. Including those water bodies classified with unknown status, poor status for \n\neach of the surface water body types \u2013 rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal does not exceed 10%, \n\naggregated across Europe as a whole, expressed by the number of water bodies or \u2017count\u2018. Poor status \n\nfor groundwaters, by area, is about 25% across Europe. Notably, the chemical status of many of \n\nEurope\u2017s surface waters remains unknown, ranging between 46% for coastal waters and 55% in \n\ntransitional waters. \n\nExcessive nitrate concentration is the single most significant cause of poor groundwater chemical \n\nstatus, although pesticides, heavy metals, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are also of \n\nimportance. \u2015Other pollutants\u2016 - a category that encompasses a mix of individual chemical types \n\nincluding PAHs and tributyltin compounds - are the causal factor for around 50% of those European \n\nriver water bodies classified as being in poor chemical status. Heavy metals and pesticides also make \n\na significant contribution to poor status in rivers, with the former being the predominant cause of poor \n\nstatus in lakes. A range of chemical types contributes to poor chemical status in transitional and \n\ncoastal waters, declining in importance in the order; other pollutants, heavy metals and industrial \n\npollutants. Those water bodies across Europe that exhibit particularly poor chemical status are, \n\ntypically, subject to pollution from a range of different chemicals. \n\f\n116 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nAsides from the critical issue of the wide extent of unknown status, interpretation of WFD chemical \n\nstatus has been partly hindered by the format of reporting, with some Member States reporting \n\nchemical groups, other individual chemicals, and some a mixture of the two. \n\nSome hazardous substances tend to accumulate in sediment and biota, with the result that their \n\nconcentrations in these matrices are likely to be higher and, therefore, more detectable and measurable \n\nthan in water. If measurements are made in the water column, the risk to the aquatic environment may \n\nbe underestimated. At least one example exists of different matrices being used across different \n\nMember States for the same chemical, resulting in assessments of chemical water quality that are not \n\ndirectly comparable. A harmonisation at EU level is, therefore, needed. \n\nWith the exception of nitrates and pesticides, EU-wide groundwater chemical standards have not been \n\nadopted and instead Member States are required to establish their own standards to be set as threshold \n\nvalues. To date the threshold values for some pollutants, e.g. arsenic, cadmium and mercury vary \n\nmarkedly between Member States, making a comparison of chemical groundwater status across \n\nEurope difficult for these particular substances. \n\nReporting on chemical status under WFD needs to follow the recently developed QA/QC Directive \n\nwhich lays down technical specifications for chemical analysis and monitoring of water status. The \n\nEEA\u2018s SoE-WISE reporting stream, however, can also play a key role in supporting chemical \n\nassessment, particular given that the annual reporting process enables temporal trends to be identified \n\nand also encompasses a wide range of chemicals that extends beyond those classified as priority \n\nsubstances under the WFD. This is particularly important given that for a number of emerging \n\npollutants, the awareness of potential effects has developed only recently and remains incomplete. \n\nMaximising the value of reporting of chemical water quality under SoE-WISE will, however, require \n\nan improved adherence to the data dictionary, including a temporal consistency with respect to \n\nchemical type and associated units, and the reporting of data at an optimal temporal and spatial scale. \n\nFor many hazardous substances, information on industrial emissions to water must be reported under \n\nthe European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). To date, however, reporting under \n\nE-PRTR is incomplete as to the spatial extent and temporal resolution of data describing emissions to \n\nwater \u2013 markedly so for some substances. Moreover, the E-PRTR thresholds for reporting mean that \n\nthe emissions from some smaller facilities are missed, despite the potential for such facilities to be a \n\nsignificant pollutant source with respect to WFD classification. It is important not only to overcome \n\nthese limitations in reporting but also to improve the quantitative understanding of the sources, \n\nemissions and pathways of all hazardous substances more generally. Advances in this area will \n\nfacilitate the identification of appropriate measures to address chemical pollution of aquatic \n\nenvironments. Moreover, the Environmental Quality Standards Directive requires each Member State \n\nto establish an inventory of emissions, discharges and losses for each river basin district (RBD) in its \n\nterritory. These inventories must cover both the diffuse and point source emissions of all priority \n\nsubstances. Industrial emissions will be a fundamental part of the inventories and, as such, reporting \n\nunder E-PRTR will represent an important component. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 117 \n\n7.

Key messages \n\n\uf0b7 Pollutants in many of Europe's surface waters have led to detrimental effects on aquatic \n\necosystems and the loss of freshwater flora and fauna. \n\n\uf0b7 Implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, together with comparable \n\nnon-EU legislation, has led to improvements in wastewater treatment across much of the \n\ncontinent. This has resulted in reduced point discharges of nutrients and organic pollution to \n\nfreshwater bodies. \n\n\uf0b7 Clear downward trends in water quality determinants related to urban and industrial \n\nwastewater are evident in most of Europe's surface waters, although these trends have levelled \n\nin recent years, and is more conspicuous in rivers than it the other water categories. \n\n\uf0b7 Despite improvements in some regions, diffuse pollution from agriculture remains a major \n\ncause of the poor water quality currently observed in parts of Europe, contributing 50-80% of \n\nthe total nitrogen load and approximately half of the total phosphorus load on Europe\u2018s \n\nfreshwaters. \n\n\uf0b7 Ecological status is clearly correlated with nutrients in all surface water categories. Much \n\nlower nutrient concentrations are found in water bodies with high and good ecological status \n\nthan in those with moderate or worse ecological status. \n\n\uf0b7 Projections of trends in river water bodies currently in moderate or worse ecological status \n\nindicate that good status may be achieved in 2027 for phosphorus (if current trend continues), \n\nbut not for nitrate. \n\n\uf0b7 The results show the need for further nutrient reduction measures, in particular addressing \n\ndiffuse source pollution from agriculture, which can be implemented through the WFD \n\nRBMPs and through full compliance with the Nitrates Directive \n\n7.2. Introduction \n\nThe quality of water in Europe is influenced by direct and diffuse pollution from urban and rural \n\nsettlements, industrial emissions, as well as the agricultural sector. Due to the overall progress in the \n\ntreatment of urban waste water, diffuse pollution from agriculture is now the single most important \n\nsource of pollution, in particular nutrient pollution. Yet, despite the importance given to reducing \n\npollution in recent environmental legislation, concentrations of pollutants in many European waters \n\nhave remained high \u2013 illustrated by the results in the previous chapters that a large proportion of \n\nEuropean water bodies are affected by pressures from diffuse and point source pollutants.  \n\nThe status assessment in the previous chapters revealed that many European surface water bodies \n\ncurrently fail the Water Framework Directive\u2018s objective of good status. To protect surface waters and \n\ngroundwater from pollution and restore the ecological and chemical status, a comprehensive \n\nlegislation has been established in Europe. The WFD has a clear target on reducing pollutants via the \n\nbasic measures on compliance with the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive \n\n(UWWTD) and Nitrates Directive (NiD). Full implementation of these Directives will improve water \n\nquality and facilitate, although not necessarily guarantee, the achievement of good ecological status or \n\npotential under the WFD.  \n\nIn Europe water quality has traditionally been measured and assessed using either basic physico\nchemical (e.g. BOD, nutrients and oxygen level) or biological parameters or a combination of both \u2013 \n\ntypically assessing organic pollution and eutrophication from point and diffuse sources. It is important \n\nto distinguish between water quality and ecological status or potential as the latter in addition to \n\nimpact of pollution and water quality also include aspects such as hydromorphology and specific \n\f\n118 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\npollutants. Hydromorphological pressures and their impacts in terms of altered habitats also affect the \n\necological status of a large proportion of water bodies in Europe. A separate EEA thematic \n\nassessment provides more information on these pressure and their impacts on ecological status or \n\npotential (EEA ETC/ICM, 2012). \n\n The European Commission, DG Environment, is currently examining the measures included in the \n\nRBMPs and evaluating if the PoMs set for the different RBMPs are sufficient for achieving the \n\nobjectives of the WFD. More details can be found in the DG Staff document (EC, 2012b).  \n\nIn the current chapter the focus is on describing the links between ecological status and water quality \n\nrelated to the effect of policies on reducing emissions to water. The main focus is on illustrating the \n\neffect of Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban wastewater treatment and Directive 91/676/EEC \n\nrelating to nitrate pollution. These two Directives are important for achieving good water quality and \n\nimprove the ecological status.  \n\n7.3. Pollution from point and diffuse sources \n\nThe sources of water pollution are extremely diverse and can vary considerably with geographical \n\nlocation. However, while landfills, forestry, mining, aquaculture and dwellings un-connected to a \n\nmunicipal sewage treatment works, for example, can all be of great importance locally, two major \n\nsources contribute most to the pollution observed across Europe: urban wastewater and diffuse \n\npollution from agriculture.  \n\n7.3.1. Point source pollution and trends in urban wastewater treatment \n\nPoint source pollution comes from urban waste water, industrial effluents and losses from farming, \n\nincluding fish farms. Point source pollution takes many forms. Faecal contamination from sewage \n\nmakes water aesthetically unpleasant and unsafe for recreational activities, such as swimming or \n\nfishing. Many organic pollutants, including sewage effluents, as well as farm and food-processing \n\nwastes consume oxygen, suffocating fish and other aquatic life. Point source pollution also contributes \n\nto nutrient enrichment by emissions of bioavailable nutrients, e.g. phosphate and ammonium.  \n\nDuring the last century increased population growth and increased wastewater production, coupled \n\nwith a greater percentage of the population being connected to sewerage systems, initially resulted in \n\nmost European countries in increases in the discharge of pollutants into surface water. Over the past \n\n20 to 35 years, however, the biological treatment (secondary treatment) of waste water has increased, \n\nand organic discharges have consequently decreased throughout Europe. During the last 20 years \n\ntertiary (advanced/more stringent) treatment with nutrient removal (phosphorus and nitrogen) has \n\nbeen introduced at many waste water treatment plants resulting in markedly lower nutrient discharge \n\nto receiving waters. \n\nThe Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive has the objective of protecting the environment from the \n\nadverse effects of discharges of urban waste water from settlement areas and biodegradable industrial \n\nwaste water from the agro-food sector, by requiring Member States to ensure that such water is \n\ncollected and adequately treated. Full implementation of the Directive is also a pre-requisite for \n\nmeeting the environmental objectives set out in the WFD as well as in the Marine Strategy \n\nFramework Directive. \n\nThe UWWTD requires the collection and treatment of wastewater from all agglomerations of more \n\nthan 2 000 people and its on-going implementation has led to an increasing proportion of the EU's \n\npopulation being connected to a municipal treatment works via a sewer network (see Fig. 7.1). \n\nConnection rates in northern Europe now exceed 80% of the population while in central Europe the \n\nfigure is above 95%. Elsewhere in Europe, however, connection rates are lower, although in the case \n\nof the newer Member States, this is explained by the later compliance dates agreed in the accession \n\ntreaties or in regions with a high proportion of the population living in rural areas. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 119 \n\nThe UWWTD requires secondary biological wastewater treatment and, therefore, the substantial \n\nremoval of both biodegradable and nutrient pollution. In addition, in catchments with waters \n\ndesignated as sensitive to eutrophication, the legislation demands more stringent tertiary treatment \n\nto remove much of the nitrogen and phosphorus load from wastewater. Consequently, in addition \n\nto higher collection rates, the UWWTD has also driven improvements in the level of wastewater \n\ntreatment over recent years. \n\nThe majority of waste water plants in northern and central Europe now apply tertiary treatment \n\nalthough elsewhere in the EU, particularly in the south-east, the proportion of primary and secondary \n\ntreatment is higher (see Fig. 7.1). While considerable progress has been made in implementing the \n\nUWWTD, excluding the longer compliance timelines for the newer Member State, full compliance is \n\nyet to be achieved, including the lack of more stringent tertiary treatment in some sensitive areas and \n\ninadequate treatment levels in wastewater treatment plants in some larger cities (Text Box 7.1; EC, \n\n2011b).  \n\nFigure 7.1 Changes in wastewater treatment in regions of Europe between 1990 and \n2009 \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nN\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n0\n (4\n\n)\n\nN\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n5\n (4\n\n)\n\nN\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n (4\n\n)\n\nN\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n (4\n\n)\n\nN\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n-2\n\n00\n6(\n\n3)\n\nC\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n0\n (8\n\n)\n\nC\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n5\n (8\n\n)\n\nC\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n8\n (8\n\n)\n\nC\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n-4\n\n (7\n)\n\nC\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n-2\n\n00\n6(\n\n7)\n\nC\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n7\n-2\n\n00\n8(\n\n6)\n\nS1\n\n9\n9\n\n4\n-5\n\n (\n3\n\n)\n\nS1\n\n9\n9\n\n7\n-2\n\n0\n00\n\n (4\n)\n\nS2\n\n0\n0\n\n3\n-4\n\n (\n3\n\n)\n\nS2\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n-2\n\n0\n07\n\n(5\n)\n\nS2\n\n0\n0\n\n8\n-2\n\n0\n09\n\n (4\n)\n\nE1\n\n9\n9\n\n5\n (3\n\n)\n\nE2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n (3\n\n)\n\nE2\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n (4\n\n)\n\nE2\n\n0\n0\n\n7\n(6\n\n)\n\nE2\n\n0\n0\n\n8\n-2\n\n00\n9(\n\n5)\n\nSE\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n5\n (2\n\n)\n\nSE\n-1\n\n9\n9\n\n8\n (2\n\n)\n\nSE\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n3\n-4\n\n (\n3\n\n)\n\nSE\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n-2\n\n0\n07\n\n(3\n)\n\nSE\n-2\n\n0\n0\n\n8\n-2\n\n0\n09\n\n(3\n)\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nn\n\nat\nio\n\nn\nal\n\n p\no\n\np\nu\n\nla\nti\n\no\nn\n\n c\no\n\nn\nn\n\ne\nct\n\ne\nd\n\n t\no\n\n U\nW\n\nW\nTP\n\ns \n\ncollected without treatment Primary Secondary Tertiary\n \n\nNotes: The numbers of countries are given in parentheses.

The report covers the implementation of the Directive up to the \n\nreference year 2007/2008. Below is listed a summary of the key messages from the implementation \n\nreport.  \n\nFor the reference year 2007/2008, Member States reported 22,626 agglomerations (72% in EU-15 and \n\n28% in EU-12) larger than 2,000 person equivalents (p.e.), generating a total pollution load of around \n\n550 million p.e. \n\nA breakdown taking into account the different size ranges shows that: \n\uf0b7 2% of agglomerations are larger than 150 000 p.e. (i.e. 586 big cities/big discharges) generate 43% of the \n\npollution load (equivalent to around 248 million p.e.). \n\n\uf0b7 32% of agglomerations range between 10 000 and 150 000 p.e., generating 45% of the pollution load. \n\n\uf0b7 66% of agglomerations range between 2 000 and 10 000 p.e., generating 12% of the pollution load. \n\nWaste water collecting systems were in place for 99% of the total pollution load of the EU-15 and for \n\n65% of the total generated load of the EU-12. Most EU-15 Member States had largely implemented \n\nthis provision except for Italy and Greece which have 93% and 87% of the generated load collected in \n\ncollecting systems, respectively. \n\nSecondary treatment was in place for 96% of the load for the EU-15 and for 48% of the load for the \n\nEU-12. As the infrastructure in place cannot always achieve quality standards in line with the \n\nDirective's requirements (possible reasons: inadequate capacity, performance or design etc.), 89% of \n\nthe total generated load for the EU-15 and 39% of the total generated load for the EU-12 were \n\nreported to work adequately showing compliant monitoring results for secondary and more stringent \n\ntreatment respectively. \n\nMore stringent treatment was in place for 89% of the load for the EU-15 and for 27% of the generated \n\nload for the EU-12. As the infrastructure in place cannot always achieve quality standards in line with \n\nthe Directive's requirements (the same reasons as for secondary treatment), 79% of the total generated \n\nload for the EU-15 and 24% of the total generated load for the EU-12 were reported to work \n\nadequately. \n\n Average share of generated load collected in collecting systems, treated by secondary treatment and \n\nmore stringent treatment for EU-15 (left panel ) and EU-12 (right panel )  \n\n  \n EU-15                                                EU-12 \n\nNotes: EU-15 refers to Member States which joined the EU before the 2004 enlargement: Austria, Belgium, \n\nDenmark, Germany, France, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, The \nNetherlands and the UK (due to missing/late reporting the UK is not included).  \nEU-12 refers to Member States who acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007 enlargements: Czech Republic, \n\nCyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania. \nFor EU-15 Member States all deadlines in the Directive have expired. Therefore proper waste water collection \nand treatment has to be in place for all agglomerations within the scope of the Directive. For the EU-12 Member \nStates, transitional periods were granted by their Accession Treaties. None of these transitional periods exceed \nthe year 2015 except for some small agglomerations (less than 10,000 p.e.) in Romania, which have to comply \nby the end of 2018. \nSource: EC, 2011b. \n\n \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 121 \n\n7.3.2. Diffuse nutrient pollution \n\nModern-day agricultural practices often entail the high use of fertilisers and manure, leading to high \n\nnutrient surpluses that are transferred to water bodies as diffuse pollution. Agriculture is the largest \n\ncontributor of nitrogen pollution, and contributes with half of the total phosphorus load to European \n\nwaters (EEA, 2005; Kronvang et al., 2009). Despite this progress in reducing agricultural inputs of \n\nnutrients, the diffuse pollution from agriculture is still significant and needs increased attention to \n\nachieve clean water. \n\nIn Europe, mineral fertilisers account for almost half of all nitrogen input into agricultural soils, while \n\nmanure is the other major input. Today, the highest total nitrogen application rates generally, although \n\nnot exclusively, occur in Western Europe (Map 7.1a) (Grizzetti et al., 2007; Bouraoui et al., 2011). \n\nThere is generally a high correlation between nitrogen application and the level of nitrate in rivers \n\n(Map 7.1b). \n\nMap 7.1 Total nitrogen application to agricultural soil and river nitrate concentration \n\na) Total nitrogen application, manure and mineral \nfertilizer for the year 2005 \n\nb) Annual average river nitrate concentration (mg/l \nNO3-N) in 2010, averaged by river basin district \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Bouraoui et al., 2011.

European overview of status and trends in water quality in rivers and lakes \n\nImplementation of the UWWTD has led to a reduction in the wastewater discharge of pollutants to \n\nreceiving waters. The economic recession of the 1990s in central and eastern European countries also \n\ncontributed to this fall, as there was a decline in heavily polluting manufacturing industries and \n\nintroducing the \"polluter pays\" principle for all users. Clear downward trends in water quality \n\ndeterminants related to urban and industrial wastewater are evident in most of Europe's surface \n\nwaters, although these trends have levelled in recent years.  \n\nThe following results are extracted from the EEA CSIs (EEA, 2012d, 2012e, 2012f). \n\nThe quality of EU bathing waters has improved significantly since 1990. In 2011, more than 90% of \n\nbathing areas complied with mandatory values (Fig 7.2c).  \n\nThe emission of some hazardous chemicals has also been reduced, as evidenced, for example, by a \n\ndecline in the discharge of heavy metals from waste water treatment plants in the Netherlands (Fig. \n\n7.2d) and to the River Seine (Meybeck et al., 2007). \n\nIn European rivers, the oxygen demanding substances measured as BOD and total ammonium have \n\ndecreased by 55% (from 4.9 mg/l to 2.2 mg O2/l) and 73% (from 587 to 159 \u00b5g N/l), respectively, \n\nfrom 1992 to 2010 (Fig. 7.2a). The decrease is due mainly to improved sewage treatment resulting \n\nfrom the implementation of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive and national legislation. The \n\neconomic downturn of the 1990s in central and eastern European countries also contributed to this \n\nfall, as there was a decline in heavily polluting manufacturing industries. In recent years, however, the \n\ndownward trends in BOD across Europe have generally levelled. This suggests that either further \n\nimprovement in wastewater treatment is required or that other sources of organic pollution, for \n\nexample from agriculture, require greater attention, or both (Fig. 7.2a).

Also average \n\nlake phosphorus concentration decreased over the period 1992-2010 (by 31%, Fig. 7.2a), the major \n\npart of the decrease occurring in the beginning of the period, but is still on-going. The decrease in \n\nphosphorus concentrations reflects both an improvement in wastewater treatment and a reduction in \n\nphosphorus in detergents. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 125 \n\nRelatively low concentrations of phosphorus in rivers and lakes are found in Northern Europe \n\n(Norway, Sweden, and Finland), the Alps and the Pyrenees, predominantly reflecting regions of low \n\npopulation density and/or high levels of wastewater collection and treatment (Map 7.2c).  \n\nIn contrast, relatively high concentrations (greater than 0.1 mg/l P) are found in several regions with \n\nhigh population densities and intensive agriculture, including: Western Europe (southeast UK, the \n\nNetherlands, Belgium, western Germany, France), Southern Europe (southern Italy, central Spain and \n\nmid-Portugal), Eastern Europe (Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland), and South-Eastern \n\nEurope (Bulgaria, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey). Given that phosphorus \n\nconcentrations greater than 0.1-0.2 mg/l P are generally perceived to be sufficiently high to result in \n\nfreshwater eutrophication, the observed high values in some regions of Europe are of particular \n\nconcern. \n\nMean annual orthophosphate concentrations (PO4-P) exceed 0.2 mg/l in some river basins across \n\nEurope (see Map 7.2c) and, whilst values vary with water body type, far lower concentrations are \n\nsuggested as a threshold to prevent eutrophication. Current concentrations in certain rivers therefore \n\nsuggest that substantial improvements will be required for good ecological status to be achieved under \n\nthe WFD. \n\nAt European level there has been an 11% decrease in concentrations of nitrate in rivers since 1998, \n\nfrom 2.8 to 2.5 mg N/l (Fig. 7.2a). Agriculture is the largest contributor of nitrate pollution, but due to \n\nthe EU Nitrate Directive (91/676/EEC) and national measures taken during the last 10-15 years, the \n\nnitrogen pollution from agriculture has been reduced in some regions. This reduced pressure is \n\nreflected in lower river nitrate concentrations. \n\nNitrate-concentrations in groundwater exceeded the compliance threshold of 50 mg l\n-1\n\n under the \n\nNitrates, Groundwater and Drinking Water Directives in ca. 10 % of reported stations over the 2001\n2008 period (CSI20). Most of these stations are located in western and southern regions. High NO3 \n\nconcentrations in groundwater are found in particular in Spain, Belgium, Germany, Romania, Cyprus, \n\nItaly and Malta. The time series indicate increasing concentrations in the south-eastern region, \n\npossibly coupled to water scarcity and drought issues. \n\n7.4.2. Nutrient concentrations and ecological effects in transitional and coastal waters \n\nBased on the EEA indicators of nutrients (CSI21, EEA, 2012g) and chlorophyll-a (CSI23, EEA, \n\n2012h) in transitional, coastal and marine waters, there is clear evidence of nutrient enrichment: \n\n\uf0b7 within the coastal zones, bays and estuarine areas of some parts of the North East Atlantic \n\nregion, particularly those near major European river deltas; \n\n\uf0b7 in the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland as well as coastal areas of the Baltic Sea; \n\n\uf0b7 in areas close to river deltas or large urban agglomerations in the Mediterranean Sea; \n\n\uf0b7 in the Black Sea, although improvement has been significant since 1990 (Oguz and Velikova, \n\n2010). \n\nIn spite of measures to reduce nutrient concentrations in European seas, 84% of measurement stations \n\nshow no change in nitrogen concentrations and 83% show no change in phosphorous concentrations \n\n(see Fig. 7.2b). Oxygen depletion is particularly serious in the Baltic and Black seas. For 87% of the \n\nstations, there is no change in chlorophyll-a concentrations. \n\nWinter oxidized nitrogen concentrations have fallen significantly at 21% of 268 stations in the Baltic \n\nSea and at 8% of stations in the North Sea. The stations with decreasing trends are in Denmark, \n\nFinland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, and in the open parts of the Baltic Sea \n\n(Fig. 7.2b). Little improvement is seen in other seas. \n\f\n126 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nIn 2010, the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations were observed in the Gulf of Riga in Latvia, \n\nthe Curonian lagoon influenced by the Nemunas River in Lithuania, the Scheldt estuary in Belgium, \n\nand at the mouth of the Seine and Loire rivers in France (Map 7.3). \n\nMap 7.3 Winter oxidised nitrogen (NO2 + NO3) and summer chlorophyll-a in coastal \nand marine waters \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: EEA, 2012g and 2012h. \n\n \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 127 \n\n7.4.3. Case studies: trends in water and biological quality in rivers \n\nThe previous section described major improvement on water quality over the last decades. This is also \n\npartly reflected in biological indicators related to water quality and pollution effects. In many \n\ncountries there have during the last 20 years been significant improvements in river water and \n\nbiological quality (See the following examples from the Czech Republic and the improvement in the \n\nRhine and the Elbe).  \n\nCzech Republic  \n\nThe major improvement on water quality over the last decades is also partly reflected in biological \n\nindicators related to water quality and pollution effects. In the Czech Republic, for example, \n\nsignificant improvements in river water quality have occurred since the early 1990s based on \n\na classification scheme incorporating indicators for BOD, nutrients and macro-invertebrate \n\ncommunities (Map 7.4).  \n\nMap 7.4 Comparison of the water quality in rivers in the Czech Republic, 1991\u20131992 \n(top) and 2010\u20132011 (bottom) \n\n \nNotes: Methodology for the maps: Traditionally, surface water quality is classified into 5 categories (shown in the \n\nlegend). The basic classification for the maps is the aggregate of the following indicators: BOD5, CODCr, N-NH4\n+\n, \n\nN-NO3\n, Ptotal and the saprobic index of macroinvertebrate communities (the final class is the worst class of \n\nthese indicators). \nSource: ISSaR, 2011. \n\f\n128 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nImproved water quality in the Rhine and Elbe Rivers \n\nSource: BMU/UBA, 2010 (Part 1 Fundamentals, p. 54-57). \n\nRecovery of aquatic fauna in rivers \n\nIn some rivers the aquatic fauna and oxygen balance in water bodies have been recorded since at least \n\nthe beginning of the last century. One hundred years ago the Rhine was inhabited by some 165 \n\nspecies of macrozoobenthos, while in around 1930 the Elbe was inhabited by around 120 species \n\n(Fig. 7.3, BMU/UBA, 2010). As pollution increased and oxygen levels fell, the numbers of species \n\nhave declined dramatically since the mid-1950s. By 1971, few species remained in the two river \n\nsections.  \n\nImproved oxygen conditions associated with improved wastewater treatment in the Rhine led \n\nto a turnaround from the mid-1970s onwards, while in the Elbe the situation did not improve until \n\nafter German reunification in the early 1990s. Some of the characteristic river species that had been \n\nconsidered extinct or heavily decimated have now returned, but a large number of typical species \n\nremain absent, no doubt partly due to the fact that their habitats no longer exist due to structural \n\nimpoverishment. Additionally, large numbers of non-native species have now replaced the typical \n\nspecies. \n\nFigure 7.3 Historical development of the biotic community and average oxygen levels \nof the River Rhine near Emmesrich and the Elbe near Magdeburg \n\n \n \nSource: BMU/UBA, 2010; adapted from Sch\u00f6ll, F., 2009a and 2009b. \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 129 \n\nText Box 7.2 Acidification \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Skjelkv\u00e5le and de Wit, 2011, WISE-WFD database, May 2012 (detailed data are \n\navailable at http://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS). \n\n \n\nAcidification has been reported in the RBMPs to affect 1650 (9%) of lake water \n\nbodies and 3500 (3%) of river water bodies (Norway not included). \n\n\uf0b7 The largest impact of acidification in rivers and lakes are found in Norway,  \n\nSweden, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Czech Republic. \n\n\uf0b7 Acidification has been largely reduced over the past decades and biological \n\nrecovery has started in most areas, although full recovery will not be \n\nachieved without further reductions in sulphate and nitrate deposition. \n\n \n\nSweden: Exceedance of critical loads of acidifying pollutants in 1980, 2002-2004 \n\nand projections for 2020.  \n\n \nSource:  EEA, 2010c. \n\n  \n\nNorway: Trends in pH in Norwegian lakes from 1990-2010  \n\n \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_PRESSURE_STATUS\f\n130 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\n7.5.

Relationship between ecological status and current water quality \n\nRiver water bodies being classified as having high or good ecological status generally have a much \n\nlower concentration of pollutants (BOD5, total ammonium, total phosphorus, and nitrate) and better \n\nwater quality than water bodies classified as having moderate to poor ecological status (Fig. 7.4). \n\nFigure 7.4 Rivers: Concentration range (1st quartile, median and 3rd quartile) of annual \naverage nutrient and organic matter concentrations in river water bodies in \ndifferent classes of ecological status or potential (high to bad) \n\nBOD5 Total ammonium \n\n  \n\n \n\nTotal Phosphorus \n\n \n\nNitrate \n\n  \n\nNotes: Average of mean annual water quality concentration values over the years 2005-2010.

Lakes being classified as having high or good ecological status have a much \n\nlower concentration of pollutants (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) and phytoplankton biomass \n\nand much better water clarity than water bodies classified as having moderate to bad ecological status. \n\nFigure 7.5 Lakes: Concentration range (1st quartile, median and 3rd quartile) of annual \naverage nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations and Secchi depth in \ndifferent classes of ecological status or potential (high to bad) \n\n \n\n \nNotes: Average of mean annual water quality concentration values over the years 2005-2010 compared with the \n\necological status/potential for the water bodies in which the stations lie. \nBased on results from 17-20 Member States, with 947 stations for Total phosphorus, 745 stations for Total \nNitrogen, 546 stations for chlorophyll a, and 679 stations for Secchi depth. \nSource: WISE-WFD database, May 2012 (detailed data are available at \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS) and EEA Waterbase Lakes Version 12 (EEA, 2012j). \n\n\uf0b7 Lake water bodies classified as having high ecological status have generally low \n\nconcentrations of nutrients with mean annual median total phosphorus, and total nitrogen \n\nconcentrations being 0.01 mg P/l, 0.4 mg N/l, respectively. \n\n\uf0b7 The annual median biomass of phytoplankton in lakes classified to be in high ecological \n\nstatus is 3\u00b5g chlorophyll/l and their median water clarity measured as Secchi depth is 4 m.  \n\n\uf0b7 Lake water bodies classified as having good ecological status have annual median total \n\nphosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a concentrations and Secchi depth being 0.02 mg P/l, \n\n0.5 mg N/l, 3\u00b5g chlorophyll/l and Secchi depth being 3m, while those in moderate ecological \n\nhttp://discomap.eea.europa.eu/report/wfd/SWB_STATUS\f\n132 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nstatus have median nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations that are 1.5-2 times higher and \n\nSecchi depth of 2 m.  \n\nThe results presented in Fig. 7.5 indicate that in many lakes it is necessary to reduce the nutrient \n\nlevels by at least 50% to achieve the good ecological status objective of the WFD. \n\nThe range of nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations are also increasing from high to bad ecological \n\nstatus, reflecting the impacts of other pressures on lakes in moderate or worse ecological status. This \n\nwider range found among lakes classified as having moderate or worse ecological status compared to \n\nhigh and good status lakes may also be caused by different sensitivity to nutrient enrichment in \n\ndifferent lake types (e.g. alkalinity and depth).  \n\nTransitional and coastal water bodies generally show a clear relationship between ecological status \n\nclass, nutrient (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and chlorophyll concentration (Fig. 7.6). Water \n\nbodies classified as having high or good ecological status have much lower nutrient concentrations \n\nand phytoplankton biomass, indicated by chlorophyll a.  \n\n\uf0b7 Transitional and coastal water bodies classified in high and good ecological status generally \n\nhave low concentrations of total phosphorus, with an annual median of 0.01 mg P/l. \n\n\uf0b7 While the difference in the annual median for total phosphorus between high and good \n\necological status is minimal, the annual median for the moderate and poor status classes \n\nincreases 3- and 6-fold respectively.  \n\n\uf0b7 Transitional and coastal water bodies classified as having good ecological status have an \n\nannual median total nitrogen of 0.3 mg N/l. The range of total nitrogen concentration in \n\nwater bodies having moderate and poor status is wider than the other classes and also wider \n\nthan for total phosphorus. Also, the two concentrations ranges in water bodies in moderate \n\nand poor status are largely overlapping. This means that various natural (such as background \n\nconcentrations) and anthropogenic factors result in variable concentrations in different sea \n\nregions. However, due to the lack of data, it is not possible to differentiate between different \n\nsea regions. In addition, the failure of water bodies to achieve good ecological status is not \n\nsolely based on nutrient concentrations, but may be attributed due to other prevalent factors, \n\nsuch as hydromorphological pressures causing habitat alterations.  \n\n\uf0b7 The median chlorophyll a concentration increases steadily between 1 - 6 \u00b5g/l for water bodies \n\nin high to poor ecological status. In the case of bad ecological status, the median chlorophyll \n\na concentration is 19 \u00b5g/l. Due to the lack of data, it is not possible to relate the concentration \n\nof nutrients directly to chlorophyll a. However, the current measurements show that water \n\nbodies that are currently in poor or bad status are characterized by elevated chlorophyll-a \n\nconcentrations.  \n\f\nEcological and chemical status and pressures of European waters 133 \n\nFigure 7.6 Transitional and Coastal waters: Concentration range (1st quartile, median \nand 3rd quartile) of annual average nutrient and summer average \nchlorophyll a concentrations in different classes of ecological status or \npotential (high to bad) \n\nTotal phosphorus\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\nHigh (12) Good (25) Moderate\n\n(76)\n\nPoor (13) Bad (3)\n\nm\ng/\n\nl P\n\n \n\nTotal nitrogen\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nHigh (1) Good (13) Moderate\n\n(86)\n\nPoor (12) Bad (1)\n\nm\ng/\n\nl N\n\n \n\nChlorophyll-a\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nHigh (42) Good (126) Moderate\n\n(209)\n\nPoor (45) Bad (23)\n\nu\ng/\n\nl \n\n \nNotes: Average of mean annual water quality concentration values over the years 2005-2009.

If the measures planned in the RBMPs are stricter and they are being implemented \n\nin the first RBMP period the improvement in water quality may be faster. Opposite if there are low \n\nambitions in the RBMPs and delays in implementing the measures, the above projections may be too \n\noptimistic. \n\nFor lakes, there are too few consistent time series to allow reliable projections.  \n\f\n136 Ecological and chemical status and pressures of European waters \n\nFigure 7.8 Lakes: Time series of annual median nutrient concentrations for monitoring \nstations in lake water bodies reported to be in different classes of \necological status or potential (high to bad) in the RBMPs.

Good quantitative status can be achieved by ensuring that the available groundwater resource is not reduced by the long-term annual average rate of abstraction. In addition, impacts on surface water linked with groundwater or groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems should be avoided, as should saline intrusions.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.
