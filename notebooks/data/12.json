Synthetic chemicals are all around us. Some of them, however, can also be very harmful to our health and the environment. How can we limit the negative effects of chemicals that have become a part of our current way of life?\nEvery day, we are surrounded by hundreds or thousands of synthetic chemicals. They are in our food, clothes, tools, furniture, toys, cosmetics and medicines. Our society would not be the same without these substances. However, despite their usefulness, we know many of these substances can have negative impacts on our health and the environment.\nAccording to some estimates, about 6 % of the world\u2019s disease burden \u2014 including chronic diseases, cancers, neurological and developmental disorders \u2014 and 8 % of deaths can be attributed to chemicals. Moreover, these numbers could be growing and they take into consideration only a small number of chemicals whose effect on health is well established.\nMore than 300 million tonnes of chemicals were consumed in the EU in 2018 and more than two thirds of this amount were chemicals that are classified as hazardous to health, according to Eurostat. Over 20 000 individual chemicals have been registered in the EU under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation.\nAs these numbers keep growing, it is increasingly difficult to assess all the effects that chemicals have on our health and the environment case by case. Most studies so far have investigated the effects of only single chemicals and their safe thresholds but people are constantly exposed to a mixture of chemicals. This combined exposure can lead to health effects, even if single substances in the mixture do not exceed safe levels.\nMoreover, persistent chemicals can accumulate in human tissues, causing negative health effects after long\u2011term exposure. For example,are a group of almost 5 000 widely used chemicals that can accumulate over time in humans and in the environment. They are an example of persistent organic pollutants \u2014 the so-called forever chemicals.\nPeople are mainly exposed to PFAS through drinking water, food and food packaging, dust, cosmetics, PFAS-coated textiles and other consumer products. The effects of human exposure to PFAS include kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, liver damage and a series of developmental effects affecting fetuses.\nUsing PFAS-free products and cooking materials helps to reduce exposure. General and specific guidance on how to find PFAS-free alternatives is often provided by consumer organisations and national institutions working on the environment, health or chemicals.\nThe \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 could be translated into everyday words as \u2018better safe than sorry\u2019. It means that, when scientific evidence about something is uncertain, and there are reasonable grounds for concern about harm, decision-makers should err on the side of caution and avoid risks. With chemicals, the development of new substances outpaces research on their negative impacts. This is why it is important to proceed with caution.\nRead more about the precautionary principle:\nCommunication from the Commission on the precautionary principle.\nEEA\u2019s.\nPer- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of extremely persistent chemicals that are used in many consumer products. PFAS are used in products because they can, for example, increase oil and water repellence or resist high temperatures. Currently, there are more than 4 700 different PFAS that accumulate in people and the environment.\nSources: US National Toxicology Program (2016); C8 Health Project Reports (2012); WHO IARC (2017); Barry et al. (2013); Fenton et al. (2009); and White et al. (2011) apud Emerging chemical risks in Europe \u2014 \u2018PFAS\u2019; EEA Infographic.\nSome chemicals interfere with the functioning of the body\u2019s hormone system. Exposure to these so-called endocrine disruptors can cause a wide variety of health problems, ranging from developmental disorders, obesity and diabetes to infertility in men and mortality associated with reduced testosterone levels. Fetuses, small children and teenagers are especially vulnerable to.\nApproximately 800 substances are known or suspected to be endocrine disruptors and many of them are present in everyday products, such as metal food cans,\nplastics, pesticides, food and cosmetics.\nEndocrine disruptors include bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and certain types of phthalates. Phthalates, for example, are used to soften plastic for use in a wide range of consumer goods, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, air fresheners, lubricating oils, food packaging, clothing, personal care products and toys.\nConsuming food and drinks from containers that include phthalates is one way to become exposed. Inhaling indoor dust contaminated with phthalates that are released from plastic products or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) furnishings is another. (This is one of the reasons why airing our rooms regularly is important.) Children playing with toys that contain these substances are also at risk and, since phthalates can also be found in consumer products, such as soaps and suntan lotions, exposure can also occur through the skin.\nThe EU has put in place measures to reduce people\u2019s exposure to phthalates by banning the use of some of these substances and restricting the use of others in toys, cosmetics and food containers. However, older products and furnishings may contain phthalates that are now banned, so they are still present in our everyday environment.\nChemicals found to be dangerous have sometimes been replaced by other substances, with a similar structure, only later proven to be just as toxic. These cases are called \u2018regrettable substitutions\u2019, such as in the case of substituting bisphenol-A, a chemical formerly used in many plastic items and in thermal printing paper, with bisphenol-S and bisphenol-F.\nMoreover, a recent inspection project by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) showed that products imported from non\u2011EU countries can still contain phthalates. China has in recent years put in place restrictions on certain phthalates in toys and food contact materials but restricted phthalates are still found in many products imported to the EU from China and other, sometimes unknown, origins.\nConcerted efforts have reduced the presence of persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins, PCBs and atrazine, in Europe\u2019s environment since the 1970s, but their persistence and the fact that they accumulate in the food chain, notably in animal fat, continues to cause concerns. Another concern is that some substances have been substituted for other, equally toxic chemicals.\nPesticides are another group of chemicals that can harm our health, mostly as a result of the consumption of vegetables and fruit that have been in contact with them. Children are especially vulnerable, partly because they eat proportionally more food per kilogram of body weight than adults do. Eating organic produce can decrease this pesticide burden but not everyone can afford that.\nThe EU regulates pesticides under the Regulation on Plant Protection Products and sets safe limits for pesticide residues in food and feed. The latest information from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shows that 95.5 % of food samples collected across the EU in 2018 were within legal limits. Table grapes and bell peppers were among the food products that most frequently exceeded the legal levels of residue. Still, based on the samples analysed, containing both regular and organic produce, the probability of European citizens being exposed to dangerous levels of pesticide residue is considered low.\nNot all chemical substances harmful to our health are new. For example, mercury is naturally present in the environment and has been released in air and water by human activity for centuries. However, today we know that ingesting mercury can affect the nervous system, kidneys and lungs, and exposure during pregnancy can affect the development of the fetus.\nPeople are exposed to mercury mainly through eating large predatory fish, such as tuna, shark, swordfish, pike, zander, eel and marlin. This also means that exposure can be limited by dietary choices, which is important especially for vulnerable groups, such as expectant mothers and young children.\nFor a more complete picture of human exposure to chemicals, there is a need for data on what is in our bodies. This includes chemicals that we eat as well as those that enter through other exposure pathways. These types of human biomonitoring data can be used to improve chemical risk assessments by providing information on actual human exposure through multiple exposure pathways.\nHuman biomonitoring measures people\u2019s exposure to chemicals by analysing the substances themselves, their metabolites or markers of subsequent health effects in urine, blood, hair or tissue. Information on human exposure can be linked to data on sources and epidemiological surveys, in order to inform research on the exposure\u2011response relationships in humans.\nThe European human biomonitoring initiative, HBM4EU, launched in 2017 and co\u2011funded under Horizon 2020, is a joint effort of 30 countries, the EEAand the European Commission.\nThe main aim of the initiative is to coordinate and advance human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU will provide better evidence of the actual exposure of citizens to chemicals and the possible health effects to support policymaking. The project has also set up focus groups to understand EU citizen\u2019s perspectives on chemical exposure and human biomonitoring.\nUnder HBM4EU, efforts are under way to generate robust and coherent data sets on the exposure of the European population to chemicals of concern. This includes producing exposure data on 16 substance groups, mixtures of chemicals and emerging chemicals, as well as exploring exposure pathways and linking exposure to health effects.\nVisit: www.hbm4eu.eu\nThe EU has the strictest and most advanced rules in the world when it comes to chemicals. The REACH Regulation is the key piece of legislation that aims to protect human health and the environment, and the EU has put in place rules for the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals.\nSynthetic chemicals released into nature can affect plants and animals. For example, neonicotinoids are a type of insecticide used in agriculture to control pests that pose risks to bees, as bees are important pollinators supporting food production. Pesticides can also affect fish and bird populations and entire food chains. In 2013, the European Commission severely restricted the use of plant protection products and treated seeds containing certain neonicotinoids to protect honeybees.\nThe EU has a body of legislation to regulate chemicals in detergents, biocides, plant protection products and pharmaceuticals. Policies limit the use of hazardous chemicals in personal care products, cosmetics, textiles, electronic equipment and food contact materials. Limits are also in place for chemicals in the air, food and drinking water. Legislation addresses point source emissions from industrial installations and from urban waste water treatment plants.\nStill, there is room for improvement to create a less toxic environment, and the European Green Deal aims to further protect citizens against dangerous chemicals with a new chemicals strategy and by moving the EU towards the zero pollution ambition.\nThere are many chemicals on the market and only a small fraction of these have been extensively studied for their risks. Designing safe products with a smaller number of different chemicals is one way of reducing potential risks.\nSource: EEA report - The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020: EEA Infographic.\nChemicals: www.eea.europa.eu/themes/human/chemicals\nSOER 2020, Chapter 10 on chemical pollution: www.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer-2020/chapter-10_soer2020-chemical-pollution/view\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2020/articles/living-healthily-in-a-chemical-world or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 10:49 PM\nFiled under: signals signals2020\nFiled under: signals, signals2020\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "ETC/WMGE Report 9/2021: Fluorinated polymers in a low carbon, circular and toxic-free economy21 Dec 2021\nFluorinated polymers are used in a variety of applications providing benefits to the society, but at the same time also causing risks of irreversible pollution and impacts on the environment and human health in different stages of the lifecycle.

We highly appreciate the valuable comments provided by the reviewers Roland Weber (POPs \nEnvironmental Consulting, sections reviewed: 1\u20136), Jos Bessems (VITO, sections reviewed: 1\u20133), Barbara \nGschrey (\u00d6ko-Recherche, section reviewed: 7.3). Bart Ullstein (BEC) provided editorial support. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 2 \n\nExecutive summary \n\nThe aim of this report is to identify potential impacts of fluorinated polymers (FPs) along their lifecycles in \na low carbon, circular and toxic-free economy, which could be relevant to consider in future assessments. \n\nFluorinated polymers are defined as polymers made up of one or several types of monomer blocks (also \ncalled repeat units), which contain carbon-fluorine bonds in their backbones and/or side chains. According \nto the European Chemicals Agency\u2019s (ECHA) definition, a polymer has at least three monomers. \nFluorinated polymers cover a wide range of chemistries, which may be fully fluorinated (per-fluorinated) \nor partially fluorinated (poly-fluorinated) polymers, which can also contain chlorine or bromine. \nFluorinated elastomers are a special type of fluorinated polymers which have rubber-like properties. \n\nFluorinated polymers are used for a variety of purposes in transport, the chemicals industry, power \ngeneration, electronics, wire-insulation, coatings, cookware, textiles and cosmetics due to their special \nproperties of being resistant to abrasion, heat and chemical attack, and provide low friction. They are \nincreasingly used in renewable energy applications. In this report the following fluorinated polymers were \nselected for further analysis: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which makes up for more than half the \nmarket; polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF), the use of which is the fastest growing among fluorinated polymers \nworldwide; perfluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), an example of a copolymer; per- and polyfluorinated \npolyethers (PFPE), used in coatings for food contact paper, glass and used as machine oils; and fluorinated \nsidechain acrylate polymers, an example of fluorinated sidechain polymers used as coatings and sizing \nagents for textiles and food contact paper. \n\nThere is a lack of official data on the tonnages produced and consumed in the EU, but according to industry \nsources about 51 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers are produced in EU each year (PlasticsEurope, 2018) \nand 320 000 tonnes globally (AGC, 2020). Even if these amounts are small compared to total amounts of \nplastics in Europe, about 62 million tonnes of which are produced annually in Europe (PlasticsEurope, \n2019), the potential impacts of fluorinated polymers along their lifecycles may be relevant to the success \nof EU policies and strategies set out in the European Green Deal and the New Circular Action Plan, such as \nthe EU chemicals strategy, the Zero Pollution Ambition for toxic-free environment and the EU plastic \nstrategy. \n\nThe main focus of this report is on exploring lifecycle stages and emissions/impacts for which there seem \nto be significant knowledge gaps. These were found to be on climate-change impacts from greenhouse \ngases (GHG), pollution from ozone-depleting substances (ODS), both of which affect Earth systems and \nsubsequently human and environmental health, and on circular economy (CE) elements related to \nrecycling processes and rates for GHG and ODS, emissions from feedstocks, by-products and thermal \ndegradation products in the production/manufacturing and end-of-life phases. Impacts from \nmanufacturing products using fluorinated polymers are not assessed and only a few examples are \npresented. Areas described in less detail include raw material extraction; the use phase; and human health \nimpacts of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which have been studied in more detail \nelsewhere. The report is mainly based on a qualitative analysis supported by some of limited quantitative \ndata available in open literature and patents. \n\nThe main observations are as follows: \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\nRaw material extraction \u2022 The fluorine in fluorinated polymers comes from a mineral fluorspar, also called \nfluorite, the mineral form of calcium fluoride (CaF2) which is listed as a critical resource \non the European Commission\u2019s Critical Raw Material list due to high global supply risk. \n\n\u2022 A future potential resource could be from recycling of fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) \ngenerated as by-product from the fertiliser industry, and from capturing fluoride by \nadding calcium during incineration of PFAS, thereby turning it into CaF2. \n\nProduction of fluorinated \npolymers \n\nEnvironmental and human health impacts: \n\nRisks of feedstock, synthesis by-products and production aids. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 3 \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\n\u2022 Feedstock chemicals of fluorinated polymers can be potent GHG and ODS, which harm \nEarth systems and thereby people, biota and the environment. An example is \nchlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), which is a major feedstock in PTFE production. \nOzone-depleting substances cause health risks by degrading the ozone layer, leading \nto an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and thereby an increase in the rate of \nskin cancer (melanomas), cataracts and crop loses. Greenhouse gases are risks to \nhealth by disrupting the climate, leading to more frequent floods, heat waves, fires \nand failed harvests. Climate change also destabilises ecosystems and increases the \nacidity of the oceans, causing death of coral reef ecosystems amongst others. \n\n\u2022 Feedstock chemicals, monomers and oligomers of fluorinated polymers can harm \nworkers and people during use. Chloroform (CHCl3), for example, is a substance of \nvery high concern (a carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction [CMR] \nsubstance); tetrafluoroethylene shows clear signs of being a carcinogen in rats; and \nfluorinated oligomers are taken up on inhalation, bioaccumulate and form toxic \ndegradation products. \n\n\u2022 Production aids such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other PFAS used as \ndispersion agents in the synthesis of fluorinated polymers have caused diseases in \nworkers. They have furthermore contaminated air, soil, surface and drinking water, \nand food production around production sites with severe consequences for the \nsurrounding communities. The pollution has also spread globally and accumulated in \ntop predators, such as fish, seals, whales and humans. \n\nEmission routes from production to the environment \n\n\u2022 Volatile non-ionic and ionic PFAS are used and formed during fluorinated polymer \nproduction and manufacturing. Scrubbers, which can capture very volatile non-ionic \nPFAS, are only known to be in place in a few cases. \n\n\u2022 Emissions of PFAS from industrial production of fluorinated polymer sites occur \nthrough air, wastewater and production wastes. Examples include production aids \nsuch as PFOA and GenX1, released with from fluoropolymer production plants in, for \nexample, the Netherlands, Italy and the United States; and synthesis byproducts/impurities/degradation products such as fluorinated ethers in the United \nStates. \n\n\u2022 Information and data lack on how of production waste is managed in Europe. In the \nUnited States, waste disposed of in landfills has caused contamination of the \nsurrounding areas. \n\nRegulatory aspects \n\n\u2022 Feedstock chemicals, and to some extent intermediates, are subject to registration \nunder EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \nregulation (REACH) for annual uses above 1 tonne per substance per application. \n\n\u2022 Some feedstocks and production aids are classified as substances of very high concern \n(SVHCs) under REACH and are subject to restriction. \n\n\u2022 Some aggregated information on emissions of fluorinated gases (F-gases) to air and of \nperfluorinated carbons (PFCs) to air, water and soil are covered by the European \nPollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and have legal reporting obligations. \nOnly few industries producing, using or handling fluorinated polymer wastes are, \nhowever, required to report, and the reporting on lifecycle emissions from fluorinated \npolymers is limited. \n\n\u2022 The most important hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and PFCs as well as some fluorinated \nethers are covered by the EU F-gas Regulation and the Kigali Amendment of the \nMontreal Protocol on ODS, with reporting obligations for their production and uses. \nThe focus lies, however, on gases used in refrigeration, air conditioning and heating \nand foam-blowing applications. So far, however, reporting is only required for one Fgas by-product from fluoropolymer production, trifluoromethane (HFC-23). \n\nUse phase \n\n(Note: exposure has not been \nreviewed/described exhaustively \nin this report) \n\nFluorinated polymers are used in a wide range of applications, typically as part of a \ncomponent or a coating. \n\nExposure of workers, professionals and consumers is highly application specific. Examples \nof exposure routes include: \n\n\u2022 inhalation (volatiles/aerosols/dust) during manufacturing, heating or spaying of \nfluorinated polymers; \n\n \n1 A trademark name for a synthetic, short-chain organofluorine chemical compound, HFPO-DA (hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer \n\nacid) \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 4 \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\n\u2022 direct human exposure from food-contact materials (PFAS in food-contact materials \ncan migrate into food); \n\n\u2022 dermal contact \u2013 textiles, cosmetics/personal care products, lubricants, oils, waxes, \nand during occupational use, etc.; \n\n\u2022 release to the environment: \n\no microplastics can be released from fluorinated polymers either directly into the \nenvironment due to intentional use in products, or indirectly after physical \ndegradation of macro-sized fluorinated polymers in products or mismanaged \nwaste; \n\no release of ionic and non-ionic PFAS from fluorinated polymers from coatings of, for \nexample, textiles, food-contact materials, electronics, medical utensils, building \nmaterials, etc. \n\nRegulatory aspects \n\n\u2022 Fluorinated polymers are not regulated for most uses and products.  \n\n\u2022 In plastic food-contact materials, monomers, PFAS production aids and processing \nrequirements of the fluoropolymers are authorised for use by the EU, and have specific \nand total migration-limit values. For other non-harmonised food-contact materials, \nsuch as paper and board, fluorinated polymers and other chemicals are not specifically \nregulated by EU law \u2013 there are no authorisation processes or limit values \u2013 but the \noverall framework regulation requires chemicals not to migrate in amounts harmful to \nhuman health. \n\n\u2022 In medical utensils, fluorinated polymers are authorised with some regulation under \nthe EU Medical Devices Regulation. In cosmetic products, fluorinated polymers are \nregulated under EU Cosmetics Products Regulation.   \n\nEnd-of-life phase General: \n\n\u2022 Studies on emissions from the end-of-life phase are scarce and hardly exist for real-life \nconditions. This is the case both for managing wastes and thermal decomposition \nunder controlled conditions (incineration) and uncontrolled conditions, such as the \nsmoldering of electronics to strip metals. \n\n\u2022 Recovery of fluorinated polymers is made difficult by their widespread use in many \napplications ranging from liquids through integral parts of wires and electronics to \ncoatings on a variety of materials, such as paper, wood, glass, stone, metal and plastic. \n\n\u2022 There is very limited information on recycling, though process scrap is recycled to some \nextent. Some recycling of hydrogen fluoride (HF) may occur in the production phase of \nfertilisers. \n\n\u2022 Chemical recycling could potentially depolymerise fluorinated polymers into \nmonomers and subsequently into new polymers. Currently only one plant in Germany \nhas demonstrated this, but has a small capacity. \n\n\u2022 The possibility of thermally degrading fluorinated polymers is currently being \ndemonstrated for PFAS (PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]) in cement \nkilns, by use of calcium as a catalyst and fluoride as a scavenger, by the formation of \nCaF2 captured in the cement.  \n\n\u2022 Emissions from municipal wastewater treatment plants occur for perfluorinated acids \nand other ionic PFAS, as well as non-ionic PFAS such as fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), \nthrough water, air and sludge. Sources used and degraded PFAS from households and \nsmall industries. Very limited data exist on emissions from fluorinated polymers of \nparticularly persistent and mobile (PM) volatile PFAS, such as FTOHs and F-gases; \nfluorinated polymers in sludge; and for water soluble persistent and mobile PFAS \nreleased from the fluorinated polymers. \n\nRegulatory aspects: \n\n\u2022 Waste handling and related emissions are poorly documented for products ending up \noutside Europe. This remains relevant for Europe both because PFAS pollution spreads \nglobally and because of Europeans\u2019 responsibility to manage their wastes safely. There \nare also concerns related to human health about the potential formation of GHG and \nODS which can destabilise Earth systems, and toxic PFAS accumulating in food, biota \nand water systems. \n\n\u2022 Due to a lack of information on the composition of production wastes, it is generally \nnot possible to assess if they should be classified as hazardous wastes. Similarly, the \nrecovery of materials or the safe disposal of wastes is limited by a lack of clarity about \nwhat types of fluorinated polymers and levels of contaminants in products should be \ntreated as hazardous wastes. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 5 \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\nEnvironmental and human health impacts: \n\nIncineration: \n\n\u2022 Emissions depend on incineration conditions, which can lead to the formation of \ntrifluoroacetic acid (TFA), corrosive HF formed and released at temperatures below \n1 100 \u00b0C, and other volatile fluorinated gases, including oligomers released at lower \ntemperatures. In non-controlled conditions, fluorinated polymers may degrade \nthermally to form a variety of volatile and ionic/water-soluble PFAS and small particles. \nThermal degradation of PTFE starts at relatively low temperatures of less than 500 \u00b0C \nand forms many fluorinated products such as the highly persistent and mobile TFA. \nOther fluorinated polymers, including PFPE, start degrading at temperatures of around \n230 \u00b0C. \n\n\u2022 Several of the thermally-formed fluorinated substances have an environmental effect \nin terms of global warming potential (GWP). \n\nLandfilling: \n\n\u2022 In landfill conditions, end-of-life products containing fluorinated polymers, such as \ntextiles, carpets and some furniture, can degrade into PFAS which may then be \nreleased in landfill leachate decades after disposal. As a result, even closed landfills \nmay generate leachates that need to be treated. Only limited details of PFAS \nconcentrations in leachate were available in the literature, particularly for Europe, and \nthere was not much information on release mechanism and the fate of released \nsubstances.  \n\nDischarge from wastewater treatment plants: \n\n\u2022 Little information is available on emissions of volatile PFAS from wastewater treatment \nplants or on the management of sludge and effluents from wastewater treatment \nplants. \n\n \n\nOverall, impacts along selected fluorinated polymer lifecycles were analysed for this report in the light of \nEU policies and strategies on the CE, resource efficiency and raw materials, the low-carbon economy and \nzero-pollution ambitions for a toxic-free environment. Potential impacts that support and conflict with EU \nstrategies were identified below. \n\nStrategy, policy Potential benefits Potential risks \n\nCircular economy High durability, longevity, \nminiaturisation of products (less waste) \n\nAlthough fluorspar is on the EU\u2019s list of \ncritical raw materials, there is almost no \ninformation on recycling or recycling \nrates. Fluorinated polymers are often \nintegrated in components which make \nthem difficult to recycle. \n\nLow-carbon economy Use in renewable energy applications, \nreduced energy need (lighter vehicles, \netc.) \n\nRaw materials with greenhouse potential \nare used in production processes and are \nlikely to form when heated/incinerated \nat temperatures below that at which \nthey mineralise fully. \n\nZero Pollution Ambition/ toxic-free \nenvironment \n\nLongevity may avoid the need for new \nproducts due to wear \n\nUse of chemicals of concern, including \nPFAS, organochlorines and heavy metals, \nwill in practice lead to emissions and \nhence to risks during their production, \nuse and at end-of-life phases. The risks \nmay stem from either the substances \nthemselves or their by-products and \ndegradation products, both of which may \naccumulate and cause long-term, \nirreversible pollution and impact \nhumans, biota, and the wider \nenvironment. \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 6 \n\nIn summary, fluorinated polymers may lead to various severe and irreversible environmental and humanhealth impacts along their lifecycles and conflict with CE goals due to limited recycling options. \nNonetheless several uses of fluorinated polymers may until non-fluorinated alternatives have been \nidentified/developed, be needed in renewable energy solutions, which supports the European aim of \nbecoming a low-carbon economy. Likewise, fluorinated polymers may for now be needed for human \nhealth to deliver clean drinking water and in medical devices. Within the overall process of risk governance, \nthere are different options for implementing the concept of essential use. There is a need to \nunambiguously define criteria or considerations for essential use to enable the application of the concept \nin decision-making processes. \n\nWith forthcoming EU legislative initiatives on PFAS and discussions of reopening the REACH regulation (EC, \n2020d), there may be opportunities to better address the costs and risks to human and environmental \nhealth of fluorinated polymers along their lifecycles. Governance options include addressing fluorinated \npolymers separately as polymers of concern as part of the discussion on the reopening of REACH or \naddressing them through REACH restrictions to phase-out uses which are non-essential to the functioning \nof society and health, but allow currently essential ones while alternatives to PFAS are being developed. \n\nKnowledge gaps identified in the study include: \n\n\u2022 studies/research/monitoring on which substances are emitted from what activities \u2013 production, \nthe manufacture of products, incineration/thermal degradation/ineffective capturing of PFAS \nemitted from wastewater treatment etc.; \n\n\u2022 research and demonstrations of potential technologies for recycling fluorinated polymers from \nproduction waste and from end-of-life products; \n\n\u2022 a broad in-depth analysis of the benefits and risks associated with the use of fluorinated polymers \nin different applications. This calls for the development of a framework including criteria for the \ncategorisation of different applications as essential or non-essential. This will require the \ninvolvement of a wide range of experts and well-informed stakeholders from all aspects of value \nchains; \n\n\u2022 research and development on alternatives so that fluorinated polymers can be replaced by \nproducts with fewer negative impacts on the environment and human health. Work should also \ninclude information on the benefits and risks related to potential replacements; \n\n\u2022 labelling products containing fluorinated polymers \u2013 this is especially important for waste \nmanagement to ensure suitable management of end-of-life products; \n\n\u2022 awareness raising among product designers of the importance of material choices. In future, the \nreplacement of fluorinated polymers may create a market value for products with lower \nenvironmental footprints. Safe and sustainable by design (SSBD) criteria could ensure that \nchemicals of concern, as identified by EU\u2019s REACH regulation and the European Commission\u2019s \nchemical strategy for sustainability for a toxic-free environment, including PFAS, are avoided in \nthe design of chemicals, materials, processes and products. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 7 \n\n1 Introduction \n\nMain authors: Margareta Wahlstr\u00f6m and Xenia Trier \n\n1.1 Background and scope \n\nThe New Circular Economy Action Plan (EC, 2020a), one of main constituents of the European Green Deal \n(EC, 2019), includes \u201cmaking sustainable products as a norm in Europe\u201d as a key measure. It is built on the \nEU\u2019s previously published 2015 Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) and the 2018 Circular Economy \nPackage, including the EU Strategy on Plastics in a Circular Economy (EC, 2018). The European Green Deal \nas well as the CEAP have a strong focus on EU Climate Strategies (EC, 2021a) for a Low Carbon Economy. \n\nThe European Green Deal mentions the Zero-Pollution Ambition for a toxic-free environment which is a \nfollow-up action to the EU strategy for toxic-free environment mentioned in the 7th Environment Action \nPlan (7EAP). The Zero-Pollution Ambition (EC, 2021b) particularly addresses the need to rapidly address \nthe risk posed by hazardous chemicals and, more specifically, very persistent chemicals, encourage \ninitiatives that ensure that products are designed to be safe \u2013 free from hazardous chemicals \u2013 and \ncircular/sustainable by design and support actions for clean material loops. On 14 October 2020, the \nEuropean Commission published the Chemicals strategy for sustainability towards a toxic-free future (CSS) \nand set actions for substances of concern, including increased measures to prevent the use of the most \nharmful chemicals (EC, 2020d). \n\nMember States and the ECHA evaluate chemicals and Agency publishes candidate lists for substances of \nvery high concern (SVHC2) for authorisation. The Agency\u00b4s 2018 substitution strategy (European Chemicals \nAgency, 2018) promotes substitution of safer chemicals in the EU. Special attention should be given to the \nEU persistent organic pollutants (POPs) regulation (No 2019/1021 replacing 850/2004) which requires that \nwastes containing substances listed in its annexes, such as PFOS and PFOA, and exceeding specific \nconcentration limits need to be destroyed and not re-circulated in new products. \n\nThis study on fluorinated polymers in low-carbon, circular and toxic-free economies is linked to the \nfollowing policies: \n\n- EU policies on plastics closing the loop of product lifecycles by keeping the value of plastics in the \neconomy and minimising waste; \n\n- the climate strategies on GHG promoting action to reduce these with particular focus on \nfluorinated gases with high global warming effect; and \n\n- the strategy for a toxic-free environment with specific focus on SVHC such as PFAS used in the \nproduction of fluorinated polymers. Identification of toxic substances is of great importance so \nthat they can be phased out from society. \n\nSeveral restrictions and initiatives for PFAS have been included in the REACH and persistent POPs \nlegislation. A timeline for restrictions and initiatives for PFAS in these regulations and legislation is shown \nin Figure 1.1. \n\n \n2 defined in the REACH regulation as substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), very persistent and very \n\nbioaccumulative (vPvB) or have other characteristics of equivalent concern, such as endocrine disrupting, neurotoxic properties \nor are persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 8 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.

The lifecycle for fluorinated polymers is illustrated in Figure 1.2. \n\nThe report focusses on two areas of the fluorinated polymer lifecycle that previously have received less \nattention. \n\n1. Releases of GHG and ODS during the production, manufacture and incineration at the end of life \nof fluorinated polymers. This includes chemicals that are used, present as impurities, by-products \nformed or environmentally formed degradation products. \n\n2. The extent to which fluorinated polymers could be integrated into the CE. Along their lifecycles, \nimpacts related to climate change, ozone-depletion and environmental and human health are \nevaluated. The focus is on fluorinated chemicals which are GHG such as F-gases, ODS and toxic \nPFAS. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 9 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. The lifecycle of fluorinated polymers from feedstock extraction to end of life. \n\nSource: EEA and ETC/WMGE \n\n1.2 Methodology \n\nFor the analysis of lifecycle impacts from fluorinated polymers, the work was divided into the following \nsubtasks. \n\n1. Description of the current status: description of fluorinated polymer flows and current lifecycles \n(management), including amounts, products, markets. Focus is on Europe. Selection of key flows \nfor further analysis. \n\n2. Value chain analysis: identification and analysis of releases from different lifecycle phases with a \nspecial focus on ODS and GWP, and toxic chemicals used in their production. \n\n3. Description of the end-of-life phase: management options for recycling potential and toxic \nemissions for key streams, generated rejects and impurities of concern. \n\n4. Assessment of impacts in the light of EU policies and strategies. \n5. Recommendations for risk governance. \n6. Analysis of knowledge gaps. \n\nThe work is based on a literature survey of recently published reports and selected peer-reviewed articles, \nespecially those on the release and emissions from the production and end-of-life phases of fluorinated \npolymers\u2019 lifecycles. The main databases used for the literature survey were Scopus and Science Direct. In \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 10 \n\naddition, other, for example grey, literature was referred to where relevant. Market surveys by BCC \nResearch, Frost and Sullivan, Plastic Europe and WOODS on fluorinated polymers were looked into. Patents \ndescribing the synthesis of fluorinated monomers and polymers were also used as a source for production \npathways, intermediates and by-products. For the production/synthesis of fluorinated polymers and of \ntheir thermal degradation/ incineration, primary literature was sought in the domain of material sciences. \nThe impacts of PFAS on human and environmental health has been extensively reported in literature, \nreviews and reports from EU funded, Nordic or national projects and therefore this study mainly makes \nreferences to these. \n\nThe study was carried out as joint work with experts from two European Topic Centres (ETCs). The \nfollowing organizations participated in the work: \n\n- ETC/WMGE Waste and Materials in a Green Economy \u2013 VTT, VITO; \n- ETC/CME Climate Change Mitigation and Energy \u2013 NILU, \u00d6ko-Recherche, RIVM. \n\nFurthermore, Toke Winther from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency and a member of the \nEuropean Chemicals Agency PFAS working group followed the work, shared information from previous \nworks on the topic and provided valuable comments on findings. The draft report was also sent to selected \nexperts for review and feedback on the content and conclusions before publication. \n\nThe work made use of the in-house EEA and ETC expertise on reporting and policies on F-gases, ODS and \nindustrial emissions (ETC/CME) and waste management policies, non-toxicity policies and CE \n(ETC/WMGE). The work also was built on the following EEA/ETC reports: \n\n- 2019 ETC/WMGE report Plastics in Textiles, and relevant references on plastics in a CE; \n- 2019 EEA web-briefing Emerging risks of PFAS in Europe; \n- 2021 EEA web-briefing Safe and Sustainable by Design; \n- EEA reports yearly on the production, import, export and destruction of fluorinated GHG (3) and \n\nODS (4). \n\n1.3  Structure of report \n\nThis report consists of nine chapters (Figure 1.3): \n\nChapter 2 sets the scene for the study; it defines the fluorinated polymers selected for the study, their \nmain application areas and their key properties. Furthermore, it gives a short summary of the global \namounts of fluorinated polymers produced. \n\nChapter 3 presents information on the origin of fluorspar used for production of fluorinated polymers and \ninformation on the environmental impacts of mining. \n\nChapter 4 describes emissions to air, water and soil during production. It also gives information on the \nglobal warming potential and ozone-depleting potential of chemicals used in syntheses and \npolymerisation. \n\nChapter 5 gives examples of emissions and exposure routes related to the use of a few consumer products \ncontaining fluorinated polymers. Textiles, food-contact materials and cosmetics were chosen as examples. \n\nChapter 6 focusses on emissions/releases from different end-of-life options for products containing \nfluorinated polymers. Technologies for recycling options of process scraps are also reviewed. \n\n \n3 https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/fluorinated-greenhouse-gases-2020 \n4 https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/ozone-depleting-substances-2019 \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 11 \n\nChapter 7 analyses the benefits and challenges at different stages of the fluorinated polymer lifecycle in \nlight of EU strategies and policies for circular and low carbon economies and non-toxicity.

This definition rules out, for instance, fluorosilicones, \nfluoroacrylate polymers and fluoropolyethers which also containing silicon and oxygen in the polymer \nbackbone, and therefore they are not often referred to as fluoropolymers (Smith Jr. et al., 2014; Russell et \nal., 2008). \n\nFluorinated polymers, on the other hand, include both: polymers containing at least one type of monomer \nunit with fluorine in it or which have a hydrocarbon backbone to which fluorinated sidechains are attached. \n\nThe term used in this report is fluorinated polymer which includes many types of fully (per-) or partially \n(poly-) fluorinated polymers including elastomers (rubbers), which also may contain chlorine (Gardiner, \n2015). At times, some fluorinated polymers are referred to as perfluoropolymers to emphasise their fully \nfluorinated composition compared to partially (poly-) fluorinated compounds (McKeen, 2017). Fluorinated \npolymers which contain a minimum of one CF2 \u2013 unit in its monomers or attached to its sidechains are per- \nand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (OECD, 2018). \n\nFigure 2.1 shows structures of fluorinated polymers, divided into fluoropolymers, where the carbon \nbackbone is fluorinated, and fluorinated sidechain polymers, where the fluorinated sidechains are \nattached to a hydrocarbon backbone. The simplest form of a fluoropolymers is the homopolymer which \nonly has one type of fluoro monomer (also called repeat units) of which there are n numbers (shown as \nan orange circle in the figure). When several types of fluoromonomers are present \u2013 shown as orange \ncircles and triangles in the figure \u2013 it is called a copolymer (Naka, 2014). At the end of the homopolymer \nand copolymer there are two end groups, A and B which may be chemically different or the same type, \nwhich can be used to control the solubility. Fluorinated sidechain polymers are also shown in the figure \nand consist of a hydrocarbon backbone (shown as green pentagons and hexagons n the figure), with \nattached poly- or perfluorinated sidechains shown as orange squares. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 13 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Structures of fluorinated polymers consisting of fluoropolymers (homopolymers, copolymers) and \nfluorinated side-chain polymers. \n\nSymbols , ,  are fluorinated monomer units, A and B describe end groups that help to control solubility of the \npolymers. Symbols   and  are hydrocarbon monomer units, n, m, and p are number of monomer units, also called \nrepeat units. \n\nSource: ETC/WMGE \n\nPolymers are not universally defined in terms of how many repeat units they should contain to qualify \nas polymers but rather polymers in terms of their material properties. In polymer and material sciences, \nwhere polymers, for instance, are described as \u201c\u2026 a substance composed of a molecule of high molecular \nweight (generally more than ten thousand). This is because polymers having a high molecular weight more \nthan ten thousand show polymer-like properties such as film and fibre forming, and the addition or removal \nof one or a few of the units has a negligible effect on the properties. On the other hand, a material with \nregular repeating structure but too low an average molecular weight to achieve their properties is usually \ncalled an oligomer. In other words, oligomer is a molecule that consists of a few monomer units\u201d (Naka, \n2014). Depending on the monomers, a polymer with polymer-like properties would typically consist of \naround 50\u2013100 repeat units. Chain lengths below this limit are called oligomers, in which molecules with \ntwo, three or four repeat units are called dimers, trimers and tetramers respectively.  \n\nA key point is that what is defined as a polymer varies between regulations. In polymer science a polymer \nis typically defined as a chain consisting of at least 50 monomers. Chain-lengths from two to 50 are called \noligomers. This is also the definition used in the EU food-contact materials legislation, which furthermore \nstates that a polymer should be self-supporting, i.e. not in a liquid form or so thin that the material cannot \nbe, for example, peeled off (EU, 2011). Another point is whether only feedstocks and additives/polymer \nproduction aids are (specifically) regulated, or whether the intermediates, transformation by-products, \ndegradation products and/or the final products with all impurities and residuals are also regulated. As a \nconsequence, not all substances which are used and produced throughout fluorinated polymer lifecycles \nare covered by EU regulations. \n\nIn the EU\u2019s REACH legislation, a polymer is defined as a molecule which has three or more repeat units, \ni.e. monomers (ECHA, 2012). In practice this means that a number of detergents and surfactants, which \ncontain homologue series of oligomers, are polymers according to REACH, and hence are exempted from \nregistration. It has been recorded that polyethers have been reclassified as polymers under REACH, \nwhereby they are exempt from registration (Wang et al., 2015b). While polymers are exempt from \nregistration, they are still subject to restrictions. Furthermore, registration is not needed if the \nmanufacturing or import of a substance amounts to less than 1 tonne a year. \n\nIn this report the REACH definition of a polymer is used. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 14 \n\nTable 2.1 and Figure 2.2 give an overview of some common commercial fluorinated polymers. Since the \nnumber of fluorinated polymers is large, only a few examples are described in this report. As a result, some \ncommercially relevant fluorinated polymers/elastomers of fluorinated alkyl silanes and siloxanes (Li et al., \n2016b) are not described. \n\nMore in depth information on structures, performance and applications of fluorinated polymers is \nprovided, for example, in Ameduri and Sawada\u2019s Fluorinated polymers Volumes 1 and 2 (2017) \u2013 see for \nexample Volume 2, Chapter 1: Industrial Aspects of Fluorinated Oligomers and Polymers (Dams and \nHintzer, 2017) and Chapter 4: Fluoroplastics and Fluoroelastomers \u2013 Basic Chemistry and Highperformance Applications (Ohkura and Morizawa, 2017). \n\nTable 2.1 Examples of common commercial fluorinated polymers and trade names which are or have been in use. \nFurther information is provided below in section 2.3. \n\nAbbreviation Trade name \nexamples \n\nFull name Repeat unit \n\nPTFE Teflon, Zonyl poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b \n\nPCTFE Neoflon, Voltalef, \nAclon, Aclar, \nHostaflon C2, Fluon, \nPlaskon, Halon \n\npoly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc39)\ud835\udc5b \n\nPVF Tedlar poly(vinylfluoride) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc39)\ud835\udc5b \n\nPVDF Kynar, Solef, Hylar poly(vinylidene fluoride) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b \n\nFEP Teflon FEP, Neoflon \nFEP, Dyneon FEP \n\npoly(tetrafluoroethylene-cohexafluoropropylene) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc393)\ud835\udc5a \n\nETFE FluonETFE, Tefzel, \nNeoflon \n\npoly(ethylene-cotetrafluoroethylene) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5a \n\nECTFE  Halar ECTFE poly(ethylene-coclorotrifluoroethylene) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc39 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5a \n\nPFA Teflon-PFA, \nHostaflon-PFA, \nChemfluor \n\npoly(tetrafluoroethylene-coperfluoropropylvinylether) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc42 \u2212 \ud835\udc363\ud835\udc397)\ud835\udc5a \n\nPFPE Krytox, Fomblin, \nGalden, Fluorolink, \nDemnum \n\nper- and polyfluoropolyethers various (often copolymers with an ether \npolymer backbone with F atoms directly \nattached to carbon backbone) \n\nFKM, FFKM, \nFEPM \n\nViton, Aflas, Kalrez, \nDaiel, Silastic \n\nfluoroelastomers, \nperfluoroelastomers, \ntetrafluoroethene-propene rubbers \n\nvarious \n\nSources: Am\u00e9duri, 2018; McKeen, 2017; BCC Research, 2015; Gardiner, 2015 \n\nOverviews of production volumes for the various fluorinated polymers are scarce and although several \nexamples exist of industry market reports these studies should be used with caution (Wang et al., 2017, \n2020). A few important fluoropolymers constitute the major part of the market: a recent article by Henry \net al. (2018), cited by Lohmann et al. (2020) states that PTFE, FEP, ETFE and tetrafluoroethylenecopolymers constitute around 75% of the market, with PVDF, PVF and fluoroelastomers also being \nimportant. More information on the fluoropolymer market is presented in Section 2.3. \n\nThe fluorinated polymers in this report have been chosen based on the following criteria: \n- to illustrate different types of fluorinated polymer; \n- how widely they are used; \n- their potential to cause impacts along their lifecycles; \n- a particular focus has been to investigate fluorinated polymers which may release GHG, \n\ncontributing to climate change, or ODS along their lifecycles. \n\nBased on these criteria the fluorinated polymer examples focused on are shown in Figure 2.2 and include: \n\n\u2022 PFTE: a homopolymer, around half of the market; \n\n\u2022 PVDF: a homopolymer, the fastest growing fluorinated polymer worldwide; \n\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/chapter/bk9781782629160-00080/978-1-78262-916-0\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 15 \n\n\u2022 FEP: a copolymer, a GHG is used in its synthesis; \n\n\u2022 PFPE: polymers according to the REACH definition, typically liquid copolymers, used as industrial \nmachine oils and as coatings for food-contact paper, glass, plastics, etc; \n\n\u2022 fluorinated sidechain acrylate and urethane polymers: examples of fluorinated sidechain \npolymers, used as coatings and sizing agents for textiles and food-contact paper. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2.

The abbreviations in red denote the fluorinated polymers \nfocused on in this report. \n\nSource: ETC/WMGE \n\n2.2 Properties and production process of fluorinated polymers \n\nFluorinated polymers are widely used in industry, laboratories and consumer products due to their special \nproperties of being resistant to abrasion, heat and chemical attack and providing low friction. The unique \nproperties of fluorinated polymers are a consequence of the strong carbon\u2013fluorine (C-F) bond (5), the \n\n \n5 The bond dissociation energy depends on the surrounding molecular environment. For example the bond dissociation energy of \n\nthe C-F bond in fluoromethane (CH3F) is approximately 480 kilojoules per mole (KJ/mol), compared to the bond dissociation \nenergy of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond in methane (CH4) that is 440 kJ/mol (Blanksby and Ellison, 2003). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 16 \n\nsmall size of the fluorine atom packing closely around and protecting the carbon chain from attack, and of \nits un-polarisability ( Puts et al., 2019a; Am\u00e9duri, 2018; Henry et al., 2018; BCC Research, 2015). \n\nCarbon-fluorine bonds containing substances are by definition of concern as they are strong and difficult \nto break, thereby almost by definition rendering human and environmental persistency issues to \nfluorinated polymer, even following incineration. Albeit just a little bit less, also carbon-chlorine (C-Cl) and \ncarbon-bromine (C-Br) bonds are strong. This means that any chemical substance containing one or more \nC-F bonds and/or one or more C-Cl or C-Br bonds is theoretically of concern for persistency in aqueous \nenvironments as well as in sediments and soil compartments. Moreover, volatile and semi-volatile \nfluorocarbons and chlorocarbons are of concern for persistency in the atmosphere and for their potential \ngreenhouse and/or ozone-depleting effect. \n\nExamples of fluorinated polymers uses include membranes and tubing for industrial processes including \nfood production and water cleansing; coatings and lubricants in industrial processes; non-stick coatings on \nmetals on, for example, baking trays, frying pans and kitchen utensils; coatings on glass, stone, wood and \nplastics on, for example, building materials and windmill wings; lubricants; membranes in outdoor jackets \nand other textiles; coatings on paper and board; and microplastics in shaving foams and for metal \nlubrication (Am\u00e9duri, 2018; Scudo, Alexandra et al., 2017), as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Gl\u00fcge et al. (2020) \nprovides an overview of some uses of PFAS, including fluorinated polymers. This study did not however \ninclude all types of PFAS, because it limited its search to those containing a minimum of -CF2-CF2- units. \nLohmann et al. (2020) also discuss potential emissions of PFAS along the lifecycle of fluoropolymers, and \nin relation to some of their uses, but does not address fluorinated sidechain polymers. The recent \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on commercial information from \nvendors (OECD, 2020) also provides information on uses of fluorinated polymers. PTFE and many of the \nfluorinated polymers are authorised for use in food-contact material (FCM) plastics (EU, 2011), and are \nalso used in so-called non-harmonised FCMs which do not require authorisation by the European Food \nSafety Authority (EFSA), such as paper and board (OECD, 2020; Trier et al., 2018). \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2011/10/oj\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 17 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Consumer products and industrial applications that may contain fluorinated polymers. \n\nSource: EEA and ETC/WMGE. Illustration by CSCP. \n\nThe properties and uses of the fluorinated polymers on which this report focusses are briefly discussed \nnext. Their production is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 and their applications in Chapter 5. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 18 \n\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is the most widely used fluorinated polymer (Henry et al., 2018; Frost and \nSullivan, 2016). It is polymerised from the tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) monomer, making it a fully fluorinated \ncounterpart of polyethylene but with a rigid helical chain construction (Teng, 2012). It is the most \nchemically resistant polymer among thermoplastics and also has excellent heat resistance, electrical \ninsulation properties and one of the lowest coefficients of friction against any solid. Additionally, PTFE is \nhydrophobic, meaning neither water nor water-containing substances will wet it. These unique properties \nmake PTFE practical in applications for which characteristics such as low friction, excellent thermal \nresistance, chemical inertness (BCC Research, 2015) and electrical insulation are required. As a result, it is \nused in numerous transport applications such as seals, gaskets and valves; as coatings on metals including \ncookware and on plastics, for example on windmill blades (Am\u00e9duri, 2020; BCC Research, 2015); \nelectronics and batteries, for instance lithium-ion batteries contain 1\u20132% of PTFE/PVDF (Mossali et al., \n2020). \n\nThe high weight of fluorine compared to hydrogen and the rigid polymer chain structure results in a \nrelatively high density for a polymeric material, 2.1 grams per cubic metre; a high melting temperature of \napproximately 320 \u00b0C; low permeability to gases and liquids \u2013 high barrier properties (Keller and Kouzes, \n2017) \u2013 and a high melt viscosity. The last property makes it difficult to mould PTFE using traditional \npolymer processing methods; however, alternative methods have been developed, and today it can be \nprocessed into any shapes for almost every application area (Teng, 2012). \n\nPTFE is available as granules, fine powders and water-based dispersions, which are produced by different \npolymerisation methods (Teng, 2012). Some of these require the use of surfactants, which previously were \nammonium salts of PFOA and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (Buck et al., 2012), but which gradually have \nchanged to a variety of other PFAS, such as the fluorinated ethers GenX and ADONA (carboxylate ethers) \nand F53B (sulfonic fluorinated ether) (Wang et al., 2015b). PTFE may also be filled with other substances, \nsuch as glass, graphite, metals, minerals and colorants to obtain specific functions. There is evidence of \nrecycling of PTFE, which may have different properties from its virgin form, but information is limited \n(Hindustan Nylons, n.d.). \n\nPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has the second biggest global market share after PTFE (Frost and Sullivan, \n2016). It is polymerised from vinylidene difluoride (CH2\u2013CF2). This structure provides performance \ncharacteristics which do not match those of PTFE, but the key advantage of PVDF is its superior meltprocessing characteristics compared: it can be extruded and injection-moulded similarly to common \nthermoplastics (BCC Research, 2015). \n\nWhen compared to other melt-processable fluorinated polymers, PVDF has been found to be the strongest \nand more resistant to abrasion. It provides even better electrical insulation than PTFE, but its heat \nresistance is not as high (BCC Research, 2015). It is mainly used in industrial metal coatings, membranes, \nwire insulation, and as a binding material in batteries (Frost and Sullivan, 2016). It is widely used in \nelectronics and batteries; lithium-ion batteries contain 1\u20132% of PVDF/PTFE (Mossali et al., 2020). \n\nPer- and polyfluorinated polyethers (PFPE) form a class of fluorinated polymers in which the polymer \nbackbone contains carbon and oxygen, and fluorine atoms are directly attached to carbons, i.e. backbone \nconsists of -CF2-, -CF2CF2-, and possibly -CF(CF3)CF2- units separated by oxygen (O) atoms (Bokkers et al., \n2019; Buck et al., 2011). The structure of PFPMIE (perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethers), an example of \nPFPE, is presented in Figure 2.4. PFPE are low-molecular-weight polymers (500\u201315,000 daltons (Da)) (Dams \nand Hintzer, 2017), which means they are typically oils or greases, and therefore their most important \napplication area is in high-performance oils, lubricants for engines and machinery and as electronic liquids \n(Solvay, 2020). Their unique properties include being resistant to ionising radiation, rendering them \napplicable to the aerospace and nuclear industries (Gardiner, 2015). They have also been used as coatings \nof food-contact paper and board produced by Solvay (Trier et al., 2018; Dimzon et al., 2016), and as \ncoatings for, for example, glass. More information on industrial uses is available in Fluorinated Specialty \nChemicals \u2013 Fluorinated Copolymers for Paints and Perfluoropolyethers for Coatings (Hoshino and \nMorizawa, 2017). \n\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/chapter/bk9781782629160-00110/978-1-78262-916-0\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 19 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4. The structure of PFPMIE, an example of a PFPE. \n\nPerfluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) is a copolymer of TFE and hexafluoropropylene (HFP). It has \nsimilar mechanical and chemical properties as PTFE combined with the melt-processability of more \nconventional polymers (BCC Research, 2015). FEP has the third largest market share for fluorinated \npolymers and is the most widely used fluorinated copolymer. It is used especially in wire and cable \ninsulation in various industries including the automotive, aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, and \nelectronics sectors where resistance to chemicals and serviceability over wide temperature ranges is \nrequired (Frost and Sullivan, 2016). \n\nSidechain fluorinated polymers are a class of polymers with nonfluorinated backbones with fluorinated \nsidechains containing -CnF2n+1 (Buck et al., 2011) or -CnF2n- moieties. These include fluorinated sidechain \nacrylate polymers, fluorinated urethane polymers and fluorinated oxetane polymers. Fluorinated \nsidechain acrylate polymers are used, for example, in water-, stain- and grease-proofing finishes for textile, \nleather and paper surfaces (Trier et al., 2018) and are further discussed in Chapter 5. \n\n2.3 Market \n\nFluorinated polymers are widely used in industry and in consumer products. Reported volumes of the \nglobal production of fluorinated polymers range between 180 000 tonnes to 340 000 tonnes, depending \non the baseline year (2015\u20132018) and polymers included (Frost and Sullivan, 2016; BCC Research, 2015). \nOne of the most recent information (AGC, 2020) suggests that the global consumption of fluorinated \npolymers in 2018 amounted to 320 000 tonnes, an increase of 19% over the 2015 global consumption \nestimated at 270 000 tonnes. Compared to other plastics, they are expensive; the cost of PTFE is roughly10 \ntimes that of many other polymers (PlasticsInsight, n.d.) and their production volumes are relatively small \n\u2013 in 2018, global plastics production (6) reached almost 360 million tonnes and European production \naround 62 million tonnes (PlasticsEurope, 2019b). \n\nThe largest consumer of fluorinated polymers in 2018 was China, with a share of 37% of global \nconsumption, followed by the United States, 22%, and (western) Europe, 16% (AGC, 2020). In the United \nStates, 78 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers were consumed in 2018 while production totalled 85 000 \ntonnes (Wood, 2020). In Europe, 52 000 tonnes were consumed in 2015, slightly more than the 51 000 \ntonnes produced (PlasticsEurope, 2017). Production and consumption of fluorinated polymers in Europe \nis discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.1. \n\nFigure 2.5 shows the market shares of different fluorinated polymers \u2013 PTFE made up 53%, 171 000 \ntonnes, of fluorinated polymer consumption, PVDF 16%, 51 000 tonnes, and FEP 10%, 31 000 tonnes. \n\n \n6  Including thermoplastics, polyurethanes, thermosets, elastomers, adhesives, coatings and sealants and polypropylene (PP) \n\nfibres.

Global consumption of fluorinated polymers, 2018, 320 300 tonnes. \n\nSource: AGC (2020). \n\nMajor producers of fluorinated polymers include 3M/Dyneon (Germany), AGC Inc (Japan), Arkema \n(France), Chemours (US), Daikin Industries Ltd. (Japan), Dupont (US), Shandong Dongye Group (China), \nShanghai 3F (China), and Solvay (Belgium) (Keller, 2020; Frost and Sullivan, 2016; BCC Research, 2015). \n\n2.3.1 Production and consumption of fluorinated polymers in Europe \n\nIn 2015 around 270 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers were consumed globally, a doubling from the \n133 000 tonnes consumed in 2004 (Kr\u00e4mer and Schlipf, 2016). PTFE with 140 000 tonnes, accounted for \nthe majority of fluorinated polymers, followed by PVDF at 41 000 tonnes and FEP with 2,500 tonnes. \nAccording to data from PlasticEurope, 51 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers were produced in Europe, \nwith an additional 21 500 tonnes imported and 20 500 tonnes exported; about 52 000 tonnes were \nconsumed in EU in 2020. \n\nFigure 2.6 shows fluorinated polymer sales in the EU by main sectors in 2015, with transport, chemicals \nand power being the largest. The cookware sector is the third largest, using 3 500 tonnes per year much \nof which is likely to enter the waste stream fairly soon given the relatively short life of consumer products. \nMost of the other sectors using fluorinated polymer also potentially add to the general population\u2019s waste \nstream. If it is assumed that Europe has a similar distribution of downstream applications of fluorinated \npolymers as the United States, 16% of the fluorinated polymers consumed in Europe are used for the \nmanufacture of a broad range of consumer products. By applying consumption data for the EU mentioned \nabove, an estimated of 8 320 tonnes of fluorinated polymers will be used per year in the production of \nconsumer products that will enter the waste stream end of life. \n\nPTFE\n53%\n\nPVDF\n16%\n\nFEP\n10%\n\nPVF\n2%\n\nPFA\n1%\n\nETFE\n1%\n\nOthers\n17%\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 21 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6.

Note: percentages may not sum due to \nrounding. \n\nSource: PlasticsEurope (2018) \n\nWhile in 2004 western Europe consumed 23 900 tonnes of PTFE, 6 800 tonnes of PVDF and 4 000 tonnes \nof other fluorinated polymers (Will et al., 2005), by 2016, 32 000 tonnes of PTFE, and 36 000 tonnes of \nother fluorinated polymers were used (Kr\u00e4mer and Schlipf, 2016). According to recent reports, 4% of PTFE \npurchased in Europe is used for cooking and baking utensils, resulting in 1 280 tonnes of it potentially \nentering the waste stream within a few years. \n\n2.4 Production sites of fluorinated polymers \n\nIn general, little information is available on where fluorinated polymers are produced in the world or in \nthe EU, though information is likely available in the countries where permits are required. In 2020, many \nof the existing fluorinated polymer production sites were located in Asia, but a number of production sites \nexist in Europe. \n\nThe EU\u2019s European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR (7)) requires the European chemical \nindustry, including manufacturers of basic plastic materials such as polymers and synthetic fibres, to report \nemissions to air, water, and land of 91 pollutants, being single substances or groups of substances. \nFluorinated polymer producers, however, do not have to identify themselves as such when they report, \nso it would only be known that the company belongs to the chemical industry and that it perhaps produces \npolymers. \n\nIt would only therefore be possible to check their emissions if their names and locations were known. \nFurthermore, it would require their emissions to be above the reporting thresholds for any of the 91 \npollutants designated by the E-PRTR, which is generally not the case. Single PFAS are currently not on the \npollutant list, and though pollutants such as \u2018PFCs\u2019 in principle could be understood and measured as total \nPFAS, the description currently only mentions some specific F-gases (8). It is therefore generally not \n\n \n7 Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment \n\nof a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and amending Council Directives 91/689/EEC and 96/61/EC. It should be \nnoted that the E-PRTR Regulation is going through an Impact Assessment that will result in a revised Regulation. This will likely \ninclude new reporting fields, new pollutants and industrial activities. \n\n8 However, if the definition of PFCs was re-defined to be, for example, \u2018PFC = per and polyfluorinated carbons\u2019 which is the sum \nof all PFCs, measured as Total PFAS (including relevant F-gases and fluorinated polymers), then the reporting of this pollutant \nwould immediately apply to all facilities producing, using or handling fluorinated polymers. \n\n36%\n\n32%\n\n7%\n\n7%\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\n3%\n1%\n\n4%\n\nTransport Chemicals and power\nCookware Electronics\nFood and pharmaceuticals Textiles and architecture\nMedical applications Renewable energy\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 22 \n\npossible to identify which sites or facilities produce, use or handle fluorinated polymers or their wastes. \nOne exception are fluorinated polymer plants, which emit GHGs that are regulated by the GHG inventory. \nThe one example is the potent GHG trifluoromethane (HFC-23), which is a by-product formed in the \nmanufacture of chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). Since HCFC-22 is used for fluorinated polymer \nproduction, residual HFC-23 may be released from the polymer production sites, and must be reported. \nAlso, fugitive emissions from fluorochemical production are reported under the Common Reporting \nFormat (CRF) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The 2019 \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Refinement Report suggests a further breakdown of \nthe reported data into emissions from HCFC-22 (2.F.9a), hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) (2.F.9b), perfluorinated \ncarbon (PFC) (2.F.9c), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) (2.F.9d), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) (2.F.9e), fluoropolymer \n(2.F.9f), and other fluorochemical (2.F.9g) production. It is, however, not mandatory for any Parties to the \nUNFCCC to refer to this new guidance in their emissions reporting. In a report, Goldenman et al. (2019) \nsearched the E-PRTR and only found fluorinated polymer sites registered in relation to chlorofluorocarbon \n(CFC) emissions, but based on a search for fluoropolymer company names, they estimated that between \n12\u201320 fluorochemical facilities are in operation in Europe. \n\nAs an alternative, measurements of PFAS in the air can be used to indicate fluorinated polymer production \nsites. This can also confirm the correctness of information of known production sites.

In uncontrolled extraction operations, the lack of measures for \npreventing the spreading of dust from tailings ponds or spillage during operation may cause \nelevated fluoride concentrations in soil and water near the mining areas and also cause silicosis, a \nserious lung disease, in workers as a result of exposure to fine dust. \n\n3.1 Sources and use of fluorspar \n\nFluorspar is used for production of hydrofluoric acid (HF), which is one of the main chemicals needed in \nthe production of fluorinated polymers. The carbon backbone of fluorinated polymers comes from \nchlorinated hydrocarbons, as described in more detail in Chapter 4. \n\nFluorspar is the commercial name for the mineral fluorite calcium fluoride (CaF2). The mineral fluorspar \nconsists of 51.1% calcium and 48.9% fluorine in its pure form. Commercial fluorspar is graded according to \nits quality and its specification into acid, metallurgical and ceramic grades (9). HF is produced from acidgrade fluorspar. In principle, metallurgical grade fluorspar can be used for HF manufacturing, for example, \nin Russia, if the remaining impurities are acceptable (10). \n\nFluorspar, or fluorite, is the only commercially mined mineral to source fluorine. In the EU, fluorspar is \ndefined as a critical raw material, and in China and the United States as a strategic mineral (CRM Alliance, \n2020; European Commission, 2020c; Blengini , G.A. et al, 2017; EC, 2013). The classification of fluorspar as \na critical raw material is a combination of several indicators: supply risk, poor substitutability, industrial \nimportance and negligible recycling. The global supply risk is seen as particularly critical due to high \nconcentration of supply \u2013 65% of world mine output is from China and 15% from Mexico (Reichl, 2019). \n\nIn 2017, 6 million tonnes of fluorspar were extracted globally, 63% in China and 26% in Mexico, followed \nby Mongolia and South Africa (Reichl, 2019). China is by far the largest consumer of both acid grade and \nmetallurgical grade fluorspar, and declining domestic supply has led to a search for other sources, \nparticularly the importation of metspar from neighbouring Mongolia (11). \n\nA relatively minor source of fluorine is H2SiF6 (fluorosilicic acid), which is a by-product from the production \nof phosphoric acid from fluorine-containing apatite minerals (CRM Alliance, 2020; Fuge, 2019). An example \nof such a future source is the Arkema company that is building a hydrofluoric acid facility in North Carolina, \nUnited States, where they will use fluorine-containing by-products from phosphate mining as raw \nmaterials (McCoy, 2020). According to a Joint Research Centre (JRC) report (European Commission, 2020c) \nthere is, however, very little interest in recycling or closing the loop of fluorspar, because of its disparate \nuse in different applications and the lack of suitable recycling technologies. World known reserves of \n\n \n9 The main grades of fluorspar available are as follows ((EC, 2013; US, 2012; https://www.eurofluor.org/hf-production/): \n\n\u25aa crude ore (contains, for example, 25\u201330% CaF2) \n\u25aa metallurgical grade (contains a minimum of 80% CaF2) \n\u25aa ceramic grade (contains a minimum of 80\u201396% CaF2) \n\u25aa acid grade (contains a minimum of 97% CaF2) \n\n10 Arsenic and phosphate impurities are the most problematic because they are difficult to remove during ore beneficiation and \nbecause they have detrimental effects on hydrofluoric acid production. \n\n11  source: Roskill, Market Report 2020.

Mexico has \nthe world\u2019s largest fluorspar reserves, followed by China and South Africa. The new unexploited resources \nin South Africa are so extensive and the technology for exploitation are new, simple and feasible, thus \neven with a number of mine closures around the world, the supply chain is ensured. \n\nThe EU production of primary fluorspar over the period 2012\u20132016 was estimated at 254 000 tonnes per \nyear (CaF2 content) acid grade fluorspar (Reichl, 2019) compared to the consumption of 755 000 tonnes \nof both acid grade and metal grade fluorspar. There is no production of metal grade fluorspar in the EU. \nFluorspar mines in Europe (European Commission, 2020a; Lauri, L., 2016; Fluorine Forum 2019, 2019) are \nin: \n\n- Spain: fluorspar production was 130 000 tonnes both in 2016 and 2017 (European Commission, \n2020; CRM Alliance, 2020; Fuge, 2019; Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014); \n\n- Germany: in 2016, a total of 149 000 tonnes of fluorspar were mined from two deposits; \n- UK: the Cavendish mine came in operation again in 2013 and produced 65 000 tonnes acid grade \n\nfluorspar in 2018; \n- mining activity in Bulgaria closed in 2016; \n- there are numerous fluorspar deposits in France, Poland and Czechia but mining has not been \n\nconsidered economic. \n\nFigure 3.1 illustrates the use of both acid- and metal-grade fluorspar and the sources of fluorspar used in \nEurope. Acid-grade fluorspar is used in the chemical sector for the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid, a \nprecursor to the production of most other fluorine-containing chemicals (European Commission, 2020b; \nCRM Alliance, 2020; Fuge, 2019; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.

Additionally, metals and potentially oxidation of sulphides from increased \nsurface ore subjected to air contact often accelerate the release of metal to surface- and groundwater \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 25 \n\ncausing local contamination of soil and water. Furthermore, noise, vibration, water pollution and dusts \nemissions generated during mining inevitably lead to animal migration and potential death. Change in \nlandscape also affects living conditions of communities. \n\nUnderground mining influences the hydrogeological conditions at the site, especially with negative \nimpacts on the ground- and surface-water quality due to the increased release of metals and salts from \nthe rock. A special concern both in open pit and underground mining is the risk of acid drainage generation, \nwhich can occur when sulphides in the tailings oxide to sulphuric acid and there is a lack of neutralising \nminerals. (Li et al., 2016a) \n\nParticularly in uncontrolled fluorspar extraction operations, a lack of measures to prevent the spreading \nof dust from tailings ponds or spillage during operation causes elevated fluoride concentrations in soil and \nwater near the mining areas and also silicosis, a serious lung diseases, in workers from exposure to fine \ndust. High fluoride concentrations in drinking water cause health problems such as dental fluorosis \u2013 in \nseveral areas near deposits about half of the children suffer from this \u2013 and skeletal fluorosis which is not \ncurable. Elevated fluoride can also lead to considerable intellectual deficits of children. (Grandjean, 2019; \nGrayson et al., 2016) \n\nAs an example of possible environmental impacts, increased levels of fluoride have been found in animal \nmeat and plants around a fluorspar mine in Kenya where the exposure was assumed to result from poorly \ntreated wastewater from the mine (Kibet et al., 2019). Fluorspar mining has also been connected with \nheavy metal pollution: Forj\u00e1n et al. (2019), for instance, found that the historic and current fluorspar \nmining on the northern coast of Spain has brought about increased levels of mercury in the area, a result \nof the inappropriate disposal of processing waste from the mines. \n\nFurther information on environmental and health risks related to fluorspar extraction at some mines \ntogether with a description of processing of fluorspar ot hydrofluoric acid are included in Annex 1. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 26 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.

As a result, environmental releases of unknown \nquantities of harmful chemicals may occur. \n\n\u2022 Both neutral (volatile) and ionic PFAS, some of which are substances of very high concern (SVHCs), \nare used as monomers and processing aids in the production of fluorinated polymers, with \nunknown emission volumes. \n\n\u2022 There are several examples of contamination of communities and the environment around \nproduction sites. \n\n\u2022 Ionic PFAS emitted to water, soil and air during production cause contamination of livestock feed \nand human food as well as sources of drinking water. \n\n4.1 Outline of this chapter \n\nThis chapter describes examples of the production of some fluorinated polymers and their potential to act \nas a source for PFAS emissions throughout their lifecycles. The examples chosen are PTFE, PVDF, FEP, PFPE \nand fluorinated sidechain acrylate and urethane polymers. The manufactured fluorinated polymers are \ntypically further processed into products and by-products as shown in Figure 1.2. The focus of this chapter \nis the potential emissions of volatile PFAS, some of which are GHGs, ODS and ionic PFAS. Furthermore, the \nemission potentials to air, soil and water during production are discussed. \n\nThe synthesis of PTFE is described in detail as it accounts for half the market. The synthesis of other \nimportant fluorinated polymers is also discussed, albeit in less detail. This chapter also includes a common \nsection for all polymers in other key chemicals (feedstock and processing aids) used in the production of \nfluorinated polymers (Section 4.7). Furthermore, in Section 4.9, the conversion of fluorinated polymers \ninto final products is very briefly covered, but this aspect of the lifecycle was not looked at in detail. \nInformation of PFAS emissions to water, soil and air from production of fluorinated polymers is given in \nSection 4.8, but waste generated in fluorinated polymer production and PFAS emissions caused by waste \ntreatment are presented further in Chapter 6. \n\nManufactured fluorinated polymers are further processed in the manufacturing of products which \nthemselves can have human health effects, such as Teflon flu, that occur mainly in fluoropolymer \nproduction and manufacturing, but which also can be caused by cooking and baking (Greenberg and \nVearrier, 2015). \n\n4.2 A detailed look at the synthesis of important fluorinated polymers \n\n4.2.1 Synthesis of polytetrafluoroethylene \n\n4.2.1.1 Synthesis of tetrafluoroethylene \n\nThe polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, CAS no. 9002-84-0) consists of a chain of CF2 molecules (Figure \n4.1). \n\n \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 28 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

In its preparation \nprocess with TFE as feedstock, many environmentally harmful substances are involved. Figure 4.2 shows \nthe major molecules that are involved in the synthesis of TFE that ultimately starts from methane (CH4). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Substances involved in the synthesis of TFE, together with some relevant intermediates and by-products. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\nMethane is chlorinated to produce trichloromethane (chloroform) in a process that leads, through a series \nof steps, ultimately to tetrachloromethane (carbon tetrachloride, CTC), yielding chloromethane (methyl \nchloride, MC), dichloromethane (DCM) and trichloromethane (Bohnet, 2002). Table A.1 shows the \nsubstances that are involved in the synthesis of trichloromethane, together with their environmental \nimpacts in the form of GWP and ODP. \n\nTrichloromethane is then reacted with hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the presence of a catalyst from the \nsubstance class of antimony pentahalides (SbClxFy, with x+y=5) (12) to produce chlorodifluoromethane \n(HCFC-22) (Bohnet, 2002). As a highly relevant by-product, the potent GHG trifluoromethane (CHF3, HFC23) with a GWP of 12 400 is created in this reaction. Best estimates suggest that 1.5\u20133%, on average 2%, \nof the production volume of HCFC-22 is emitted in the process (13). Table A.2 gives the substances that are \ninvolved in the synthesis of HCFC-22, an ODS and potent GHG with a GWP of 1 760 and a major feedstock \nfor the production of TFE. \n\nGiven that around 94 000 tonnes of HCFC-22 were produced in the EU in 2018 (14), approximately 1 880 \ntonnes (2%) of HFC-23 would have been emitted in the process in that year. This corresponds to 23 million \ntonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq). HFC-23 is directly vented to the atmosphere in many cases \nbut can also be partially captured or thermally destroyed. The latter necessitates the use of a caustic \nscrubber to capture and further process fluorine-containing vent gases (15). While in developed countries \nemissions of HFC-23 decreased strongly after around 1998, remained relatively constant over the past 10 \nyears but increased recently (Stanley et al., 2020), global atmospheric concentrations showed a constant \n\n \n12 https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/bgp/3_8_HFC-23_HCFC-22_Production.pdf \n13 Unpublished non-confidential data from the yearly reporting on ozone-depleting substances by the ETC/CME. \n14 Unpublished non-confidential data from the yearly reporting on ozone-depleting substances by the ETC/CME. \n15 https://cdm.unfccc.int/public_inputs/inputam0001/Comment_AM0001_Honeywell_061004.pdf \n\nR\n2\n\nR\n1\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nn\n\nHCl\n\nCl\n\nCl\n\nH\n\nF Cl\n\nF\n\ntrichloromethane \n(chloroform)\n\nchlorodifluoromethane\n(HCFC-22)\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\ntetrafluoroethylene\n(TFE)\n\nH\n\nF\n\nFF\n\ntrifluoromethane \n(HFC-23)\n\nH\n\nH H\n\nH\n\nmethane\n\nHH\n\nH\n\nCl\n\nHCl\n\nH\n\nCl\n\nClCl\n\nCl\n\nCl\n\ntetrachloromethane\n(CTC)\n\nchloromethane\n(MC)\n\ndichloromethane\n(DCM)\n\noctafluorocyclobutane \n(PFC-318)\n\nF\n\nFF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF F\n\nF\n\nhttps://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/bgp/3_8_HFC-23_HCFC-22_Production.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 29 \n\nincrease over the last decades (16). Since the recent uptake in emissions in developed countries is due to \nRussia and the US (Stanley et al. 2020), and the corresponding HCFC-22 production quantities have been \nrelatively constant in the last decade, it can be concluded that in Europe measures are routinely in place \nto abate some of the emissions of HFC-23 from manufacturing facilities. Very roughly, it can be \napproximated that around 240 gigagrams17 of HCFC-22 were produced annually in the last decade in \ndeveloped countries, with around 1.6 Gg of by-produced HFC-23 (Figure 1 in Stanley et al. 2020). Given a \n2% rate of by-produced HFC-23, around 4.8 Gg are expected to be emitted to the atmosphere each year, \nroughly three times what is being reported. Assuming proper reporting, facilities in Europe should abate \naround two-thirds of by-produced HFC-23, with one-third being vented to the atmosphere. \n\nTFE is commercially synthesised from HCFC-22 by pyrolysis at 750\u2013950 \u00b0C (Puts et al., 2019; Siegemund et \nal., 2000) but HFC-23 can be used instead of HCFC-22. \n\nBy-products of both routes include, apart from HF and HCl, perfluoro- and chlorofluorocarbon products, \nsuch as hexafluoropropylene (HFP, CF3CF=CF2) (Puts et al., 2019) that degrades entirely in the atmosphere \nto the highly persistent trifluoroacetic acid (Mashino et al., 2000a), the strong GHG octafluorocyclobutane \n(PFC-318) (M\u00fchle et al., 2019), which has a GWP of 9 540 and the acutely toxic perfluoroisobutylene (PFIB) \nused as a warfare agent (Puts et al., 2019a). Table A.3 gives an overview of substances involved in the \nsynthesis of TFE. \n\nTFE used for polymerisation is usually 99.99% pure and contaminants include HCl, CF4 (GWP 6 630), HFP, \ntrifluoroethane (C2F3H3, GWP 328 or 4 800, depending on the isomer: 1,1,2-trifluoroethane (HFC-143) or \n1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HFC-143a)), difluoroethane (C2F2H4, GWP 16 or 138, depending on the isomer: 1,2difluoroethane (HFC-152) or 1,1-difluoroethane (HFC-152a)), and hexafluoroethane (PFC-116, C2F6, GWP \n11 100) (Puts et al., 2019). \n\nBox 4.1 \nGlobal warming potential and ozone-depleting potential \nSome gases have the potential to contribute to global warming or harm the protective ozone layer. So-called GHGs \nabsorb infrared radiation in specific frequency ranges, thus trapping heat within the troposphere, the lowest layer of \nthe atmosphere. The most abundant GHG is CO2, which serves as a reference for calculating the GWP of other gases \non a per kg basis. Typically, the GWP is calculated over a time horizon of 100 years. Based on the 5th IPCC Assessment \nReport, CH4, for example, has a GWP of 28, meaning that 1 kg of CH4 that is released into the atmosphere will lead \nto an increase in temperature that is equal to the emission of 28 kg of CO2. The higher the GWP, the stronger the \nGHG in terms of its contribution to global warming. Generally, more stable molecules can exert their effect for a \nlonger time, and therefore halogenated gases, mostly containing chlorine, fluorine or bromine, usually have high \nGWPs. \n\nIt should be noted that the 6th IPCC Assessment Report, on average, lists higher GWPs for CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs than \nthe 5th Assessment Report. Also, GWPs are only calculated for the specific substance in question without regard for \nany other GHG that may be produced in the process of manufacturing or destroying the specific substance along \ntheir lifecycles.  \n\nApart from increasing global temperature, and due to their long atmospheric lifetimes, halogenated gases, mostly \ncontaining chlorine or bromine, can reach the stratosphere, the upper part of the atmosphere. Here, they can react \nwith ice crystals in polar stratospheric clouds, releasing chlorine and bromine radicals that, energised by sunlight, can \nbreak down ozone (O3) into oxygen, (O2), destroying the protective ozone layer and leading to a seasonal ozone hole, \nmainly over the southern hemisphere. Analogously to the GWP, the magnitude of ozone-depletion of a gas is \nexpressed as ODP and calculated based on the effect of the reference molecule trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), \nwhich has an ODP of 1. For example, HCFC-22, a potent GHG with a GWP of 1 760, has an ODP of 0.55, that is, 1 kg \nof HCFC-22 has the same effect on the ozone layer as 0.55 kg of CFC-11. \n\n \n16 http://agage2.eas.gatech.edu/data_archive/data_figures/monthly/pdf/HFC-23_mm.pdf \n17 Gigagram (109 grams) \n\nhttp://agage2.eas.gatech.edu/data_archive/data_figures/monthly/pdf/HFC-23_mm.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 30 \n\n4.2.1.2 Polymerisation of polytetrafluoroethylene \n\nPTFE can be polymerised from TFE by different methods. The most frequently employed method in largescale industrial facilities is conventional radical polymerisation (Puts et al., 2019). The PTFE polymer is \ngrown by successively adding TFE monomer blocks to the polymer chain. In industrial processes, dispersion \nor emulsion polymerisation in an aqueous medium are most frequently employed, which necessitates \nadding different substances to the reaction mix. For example, less than 0.6 mol % of perfluoromethyl vinyl \nether (PMVE) is frequently added to impart specific mechanical properties (Puts et al., 2019). Many other \nsubstances are added in the polymerisation process that will be briefly introduced. \n\n4.2.1.2.1 Initiators \n\nTo initiate the polymerisation reaction, certain chemicals are added to generate free radicals. Many \ndifferent initiators can be used, which will influence the mechanical properties and the stability of the \npolymer towards degradation. Degradation typically occurs at the residual radical sites or end-groups in \nthe PTFE, and through radical reactions which may be initiated upon heating, oxidative or other kinds of \nstress (Puts et al., 2019). From the group of inorganic initiators, persulfates, and especially ammonium \npersulfate, are the preferred choice. Most commonly, however, organic peroxides are added as initiators. \nAlso, fluorinated initiators, mainly from the group of oligo (hexafluoropropylene oxide) peroxides and \nbis(pentafluoropropionyl) peroxide, are employed by industry. A selection of initiators is presented in \nTable A.4. \n\n4.2.1.2.2 Solvents/carriers \n\nPolymerisation of TFE needs an electron source that can be the solvent or better, carrier, the choice of \nwhich is, among other aspects, linked to the used initiator (Puts et al., 2019). Preferred solvents are water, \nPFCs, as well as CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs. Table A.5 gives an overview of possible halogenated \nsolvents/carriers. \n\n4.2.1.2.3 Dispersants \n\nDispersing agents are needed in emulsion polymerisation to produce fine PTFE powder (Puts et al., 2019). \nHistorically, perfluorinated monocarboxylic acid, including their salts, have been the most frequently \nemployed dispersants, for example perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Table A.6 gives an overview of some \ndispersants (surfactants). \n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), or its salt ammonium pentadecafluorooctanoate (APFO), have been the \ndispersant of choice for the polymerisation of TFEs since the 1950s. Replacements need to contain \nfluorinated moieties in order to be compatible with TFE in the polymerisation step. Commercialised \nfluorinated alternatives are, for example, per- and polyfluorinated polyethers (PFPEs), including ADONA \nand GenX (see Table A.6). Many other suspected perfluoroether carboxylic acids (PFECA) are in use, \ncausing harmful emissions to the environment. \n\n4.2.1.2.4 Chain transfer agents \n\nChain transfer agents (CTAs) cause problems in the reaction since they terminate the polymer chain but \nthey are sometimes needed because without them macroradicals can be trapped in the polymer matrix, \nresulting in lower thermal stability (Puts et al., 2019). Further, they prevent the product from sticking to \nthe walls. For this purpose, substances such as H2, hydrocarbons, certain HFCs (listed in Table A.7), such as \nHFC-23, or citric acid are added as chain transfer agents. \n\n4.3 Polyvinylidene fluoride \n\nPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Figure 4.3) is the fastest growing fluorinated polymer worldwide and is \nused as insulating material in electrical and electronic applications and as a coating in the construction \nindustry. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 31 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3.

Apart from \ntheir use as lubricants, they are also contained as emollients in skin-care products and other cosmetics. \nMost frequently, the subgroup of perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethers (PFPMIEs) are mentioned as \nrepresentatives of the PFPE group (Figure 4.5). PFPMIEs are sold under brand names such as Galden or \nFluorinert for low molecular mass perfluoroethers, and Krytox or Fomblin for high molecular mass ones \n(Siegemund et al., 2000). Low molecular mass PFPMIEs are prepared by the electrochemical fluorination \nof aliphatic (not aromatic) ethers, alcohols or carboxylic acids, such as isomers of C6F12O, C7F4O or C8F16O, \nor by fluorination of partially fluorinated or nonfluorinated ethers (Siegemund et al., 2000). High molecular \nmass PFPMIEs, on the other hand, are synthesised from hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO, 2,2,3-trifluoro3-(trifluoromethyl)oxirane, CAS no. 428-59-1) or from perfluorinated olefins, such as TFE or HFP. The latter \nis also the feedstock for hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) (Oppenheimer et al., 2007). \n\nThe PFPMIE demnum (F-(CF2CF2CF2O)n-CF2CF3) can be synthesised from tetrafluorooxetane (2,2,3,3tetrafluorooxetane, C3H2F4O, CAS no. 765-63-9) (Howell et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Structure of PFPMIE with the repeating monomer units n and m. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\nAppendix 8.A in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Climate Change 2013: The Physical \nScience Basis (IPCC 2013) lists one PFPMIE with the formula CF3OCF(CF3)CF2OCF2OCF3 (Figure 4.5 with n = 1 \nand m = 1) with a GWP of 8 070. Based on the atmospheric lifetime and radiative forcing of \nCF3OCF(CF3)CF2OCF2OCF3, Young et al. (2006) derived a GWP of 1.95 times that of trichlorofluoromethane \n(CFC-11, CCl3F), which would amount to 9 535, given a GWP for CFC-11 of 4 890. \n\n4.5 Perfluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymers \n\nPerfluorinated ethylene\u2010propylene (FEP) is a copolymer of TFE and HFP. It retains most of the desirable \ncharacteristics of (PTFE) but with a melt viscosity low enough for conventional melt processing. The \nintroduction of HFP lowers the melting point of PTFE from 327 \u00b0C to about 260 \u00b0C. As a thermoplastic, it \ncan be processed by extrusion and compression, injection and blow moulding. Films can be heat bonded \nand sealed, vacuum formed, and laminated to various substrates. Aqueous and nonaqueous dispersion \npolymerisations are the most convenient routes of producing these copolymers. The polymerisation \nconditions are similar to those of TFE homopolymer dispersion polymerisation (Gangal and Brothers, \n2010). Dispersion is used as a coating for glass fabric, chemical barriers and wire insulating tapes; as \nadhesive coatings for bonding seals and bearings of PTFE to metallic and non-metallic components; and as \nantifriction or antistick coatings for metals. The fusion of FEP to provide a continuous film depends on a \ntime-temperature relationship; 1 minute at 400 \u00b0C or 40 minutes at 290 \u00b0C is sufficient to achieve good \nfusion (Gangal and Brothers, 2010). \n\n4.6 Fluorinated sidechain polymers \n\nSidechain fluorinated polymers consist of a carbon chain backbone not containing any fluorine, with \nattached polyfluorinated and perfluorinated side chains (Figure 4.6). Some examples are fluorinated \nacrylates, urethanes and oxetanes. During the lifetime of these fluorinated polymers, unreacted side \nchains can be released \u2013 mostly telomeric PFAS as, for example, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs)\u2013 or these \n\nO\n\nF\n\nF\n\nO\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\nFF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF O\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nn\n\nm\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 33 \n\nsidechains can degrade and release ionic PFAS (Figure 4.7). Perfluorinated carboxylic acids are the most \ncommon breakdown product (Dinglasan-Panlilio and Mabury, 2006). In 2006, polymers made up \napproximately 80% of the reported production in the fluorotelomer market (Dinglasan-Panlilio and \nMabury, 2006). In the same paper, unbound alcohols from the monomer phase of the process were found \nas residuals from the methacrylate monomer, indicating either incomplete synthesis or poor purification \nat the monomer step of the manufacturing process. Due to the high volatility of the telomeric PFAS used \nas sidechains, this group of fluorinated polymers can act as a substantial contribution to the atmospheric \nburden of volatile PFAS and subsequently as an environmental pollutant with ionic PFAS as a final \ndegradation product. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6.

For the fluorinated sidechain polymers, hydrocarbon chemicals are \nused to make the hydrocarbon backbone, for instance an acrylic polymer, to which fluorinated sidechains \nare attached. The fluorinated sidechains may be linked to the polymer backbone through heteroatoms \nsuch as oxygen, sulphur or amino groups, in the form of esters, thioesters, ethers, amines, imine, etc., \nwhich will make the fluorinated sidechains more or less amenable to degradation. Fluorotelomer alcohols \nhave been used as sidechains. The chemicals used to produce these fluorinated sidechains are described \nelsewhere. Information on GWP and ODP values of substances linked to fluorinated polymer production \nare provided in Annex 2. \n\n4.7.2 Fluorinated production aids involved in the synthesis of fluorinated polymers \n\nIn the majority of cases, fluorinated polymer production requires not only fluorine-containing feedstock \nchemicals but also fluorinated production aids for polymers, as defined by the Plastics regulation for foodcontact materials EU 10/2011, such as dispersion aids and polymerisation initiators. Production of such \nfluorinated production aids can also lead to emissions of a large number of poly- and perfluorinated byproducts, both highly volatile and water soluble (Hopkins et al., 2018). \n\nSecondly, the fluorinated polymers, such as PTFE, are themselves processed at high temperatures of 340\u2013\n400 \u00b0C, using up to 0.5% w/w of perfluoro- and polyfluoro-emulsifiers and dispersing agents including \nADONA, GenX and other PFOA replacements (Table A 6) (Gomis et al., 2015). In general, the use of salts of \nPFECA substances with 4\u22129 per- or polyfluorinated carbons and 1\u22123 ether bonds \u2013 Chemours products \nGenX (CAS no. 62037\u221280\u22123), ADONA (CAS no. 958445\u221244\u22128) and products from Asahi (CAS no. \n908020\u221252\u22120) and Solvay (CAS no. 329238\u221224\u22126) are mostly reported (Song et al., 2018). Their molecular \nstructures often contain perfluorinated alkyl chains no longer than four fluorinated carbons. Fluorinated \nsidechains or ether linkages interrupt the carbon chains and fluorine is replaced with chlorine atoms at the \nend of the perfluoroether chain. Though heteroatoms can increase degradability in some cases, ether and \nthioether links tend to be very stable towards degradation and therefore do not substantially decrease the \npersistency (Krafft and Riess, 2015). The bioaccumulation of the fluorinated emulsifier may also \ncorrespond to the long chain PFAS according to modelling. The inclusion of Cl will mean that the PFAS \nevade restrictions such as being precursors of specific chemicals such as PFOS, where one F has been \nreplaced by Cl (Washington et al., 2020). Their fluorinated degradation products may however still be \npersistent. As one consequence of the modified molecular design, higher emissions to the atmosphere can \nbe expected, because the volatility of the replacement chemicals, perfluoro triether carboxylic acids \n(PFTECAs), is higher than that of PFOA, and as seen by their higher air-water partition coefficient (KAW) \nvalues (Crookes and Fisk, 2018; Gomis et al., 2015), PFTECAs show lower partitioning into water, i.e., they \nare less mobile. Calculation of long-range transport potentials (LRTP) by Gomis et al. (2015) estimated a \nsimilar overall persistence (Pov) of the PFOA replacements of 1 038 days (GenX, PFTECA), and conclude that \neven though PFECAs and polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (PFESAs) which are alternatives to PFOA and \nPFOS, respectively, contain some structural differences, their physicochemical properties are not \nsignificantly changed compared to those of their predecessors. \n\nFurther, several additional production aid candidates have been reported in wastewater or river water \ndownstream of plants manufacturing fluorinated polymers including monochlorine-substituted \nperfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (Cl-PFCAs), monohydrogen-substituted PFCAs (H-PFCAs), hydrogensubstituted PFCAs (x H-PFCAs), monoether PFECA substances, and polyether PFECA substances as well as \npolyether sulfonic acids (Gebbink et al., 2017; Newton et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Shi et \nal., 2015; Strynar et al., 2015). Other compounds are suspected to be by-products emitted from \nfluoromonomer and Nafion production. For example, the C3 Perfluoro(2-methyl-3-oxahexanoyl) fluoride \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 36 \n\n(also called a HFPO dimer, acid fluoride) is a useful HFPO intermediate typically used in the synthesis of \nfluoromonomers, fluorinated polymers and to add fluorine functionality to a variety of organic precursors \n(Hopkins et al., 2018). \n\n4.8 Emissions by fluorinated polymer production \n\nAs described in Chapter 4.7, transformation and degradation products may be formed from the \npolymerisation aids used in the fluorinated polymer production. Emitted PFAS may be neutral or ionic. In \naddition to the examples given below, there are several pollution cases reported around the globe, \nincluding the discovery of new pollutants around the well-known site of the 3M factory in Belgium. \n\nNo information on the emission of neutral, small-sized PFAS molecules was available aside that mentioned \nabove on their potential formation during the production process and what is reported by M\u00fchle et al. \n(2019). These authors report that several facilities in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United \nKingdom, which likely produce PTFE, are co-located with identified perfluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8) emission \nhot spots (0.026 \u00b1 0.013 Gg per year). Potentially, both GHG and ODS can also be formed and subsequently \nemitted if no suitable and efficient removal measures are applied. \n\nFor emissions of ionic PFAS, however, model estimates are available in the literature. To estimate the \nmagnitude of ongoing ionic PFAS emissions during PTFE production, PFCA emission estimates from the \nlifecycle of PFOA-based products published by Wang et al., (2014) were used. \n\nThe available modelled emission data covering the complete lifecycle of PFOA-based products, enable the \nextraction of the emission estimates for PFCAs during the production of a number of fluorinated polymers \n(PFOA-based PTFE, FEP and PFA) (Figure 4.8). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8. Illustration of used data for emission estimation of ionic PFAS production aids during fluorinated polymer \nproduction. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 37 \n\nNote: PFCA emissions can be explained by four processes marked with red circles: direct and indirect formation during the \nproduction of sidechain fluorinated polymers, direct emissions during the production of PTFE and other fluorinated polymers \nSources: OECD (2018); modified from Wang et al. (2014) \n\nWang et al. (2014) expected that after 2015 there would be no fluorinated polymer production using APFO \ntechnology in western Europe. To cover the worst-case scenario for ionic PFAS emissions, 2015 data for \nthe \u2018higher\u2019 scenario in Wang et al. (2014) were used to estimate possible emissions of PFCA substitutes \ncaused by the ongoing global PTFE production. Unsurprisingly, the global PFAS emissions caused by \nfluorinated polymer production of PTFE, FEP and PFA constitute 609 t/year, about 97% of the estimated \ntotal emissions of 627 t/year estimated for all fluorinated polymers. Since European fluorinated polymer \nproduction represents about 20% of the global total, the resulting PFAS emissions (of PFOA and PFNA \nsubstitutes) can be estimated to be about 120 t/year, when assuming similar usage and emissions by the \nsubstituted PFAS on the basis of the similarities between PFOA and replacement chemicals, and assumed \nlimited changes in emissions control during fluorinated polymer manufacture. A different composition of \nthe emissions is, however, expected with fewer PFCAs containing a perfluorinated chain length of eight \ncarbon atoms (C8) and a longer and rather broader variety of branched, ether-linked or chlorine containing \nreplacement PFAS. Due to the broad variety of the composition of emissions, a differing environmental \ndistribution of emitted PFAS to the aquatic phase, the atmosphere and/or the terrestrial sphere is also \nexpected. However, besides GenX, no emission volumes of PFOA replacements are available, either in the \nshape of measured field data or modelled emission data.  \n\nOn the other hand, Adona and GenX, which have a similar polarity but a smaller molecular size than PFOA, \ndisplay slightly more hydrophilic behaviour. Conversely, larger molecules, such as PFTECAs, have a higher \nair-water partition coefficient (KAW) than PFOA, supporting increased atmospheric distribution. \n\nAdding even more complexity to PFAS used as fluorinated polymer production aids is the manufacture of \nthe chemicals themselves. Hopkins et al. (2018) also report that atmospheric emissions of the GenX \nprecursor, a tricarbon (C3) dimer acid fluoride (CAS no. 2062-98-8), possibly causes elevated aquatic levels \nof hexafluoropropylene oxide\u2013dimer acid (HFPO-DA/GenX) in lakes and rivers (Hopkins et al., 2018). \n\nA recent study reported that only 50% of the fluorinated polymer processing aid GenX is captured from \nthe production waste streams of the Chemours plant in Dordrecht, the Netherlands (Gebbink and van \nLeeuwen, 2020). Emissions of PFOA, PFNA and synthesis by-products from other fluorinated polymer \nproduction sites have been thoroughly documented in China and the United States over the years, and \nprobably in Europe as well in the past (Fang et al., 2020; Panikkar et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Jin et al., \n2015; Shi et al., 2015; Strynar et al., 2015). The emissions have been shown to lead to widespread \nenvironmental contamination of air, soil, water and food (Guillette et al., 2020; Pellizzaro et al., 2018; \nValsecchi et al., 2015), but whether these emissions are still ongoing in the EU is unclear. However, the \nemissions of c-C4F8 linked with TFE/HFP/PTFE/FEP production facilities show the potential of other \nemissions of both neutral and ionic PFAS from such facilities (M\u00fchle, et al., 2019). \n\nDue to the high volatility of most of the neutral PFAS, the atmosphere is expected to act as the target sink \nfor the majority of these compounds. Telomeric PFAS as FTOHs, will eventually degrade to form the \nenvironmentally stable PFCAs while neutral sulphonamides might degrade to PFSAs, further distributing \ninto the terrestrial and aquatic global spheres and adding to the overall global ionic PFAS burden as indirect \nsources. On top of this, direct emissions of ionic PFAS are also still happening as outlined above, possibly \nmore so than through indirect sources, causing a complex mix of final degradation products including \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 38 \n\nPFCAs and PFSAs, intermediates and precursor compounds polluting the environment. Surface and \ndrinking water, soil and agricultural produce have been reported to exhibit major contamination with PFAS \nin the vicinity of manufacturing sites in China, Europe and the United States (Box 4.2). \n\nAccording to Li et al. (2017), 99% of C4 to C7 PFCAs and to a slightly lower extent C8 to C12 PFCAs will \ndistribute to the hydrosphere, while C13 and longer chained PFCAs will increasingly be adsorbed by \nsediments and soil (Li et al., 2017). \n\nIn general, a broad contamination of the surrounding environment, spreading in both the terrestrial and \nthe aquatic spheres, has been documented for a range of fluorinated polymer production sites and is to \nbe expected for all fluorinated polymer manufacturing and fabrication sites. Harmful impacts on wildlife \nand human health are to be expected, especially in terms of food and drinking-water safety. \n\nBox 4.2 Impact on soil and water \u2013 case example of emissions \n\nIn several studies from the Netherlands (Gebbink and van Leeuwen, 2020; Brandsma et al., 2019), France \n(Bach, 2017), China (Song et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2015b), the United States (Hopkins et al., 2018), and \nJapan (Shiwaku et al., 2016) water samples and in some cases in soil, grass and leaf samples were collected \nat different distances from fluoropolymer manufacturing plants for measurement of PFAS or fluorinated \nsubstances. Vegetables used for human consumption and grown close to PFAS production facilities in \nChina contained high concentrations of short chained PFCAs, proving an efficient uptake of water soluble \nPFAS in plants (Zhang et al., 2017). In most cases, the highest PFAS concentrations were detected near \nthe manufacturing plants supporting the hypothesis that plants are primary sources for PFAS emitted in \nthe surroundings. \n\nEmissions to the environment from a Dutch Chemours manufacturing plant have been in analysed \n(Gebbink and van Leeuwen, 2020; Gebbink et al., 2017) based on information in public databases. Key \nfigures from the articles include the following. \n\n\u2022 In a Dutch manufacturing plant producing PTFE, and FEP, PFOA was used until 2012 as a \npolymerisation aid. Since 2013, it has been substituted by GenX, an ammonium salt of 2,3,3,3tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoroporoxy)propanoic acid. \n\n\u2022 In 2012, emissions of PFOA to the air were estimated to 134 kg, considerably less than in 1995 when \nemissions peaked at 6 800 kg. The cumulative amount emitted to air was calculated to be around 36 \ntonnes based on years for which data were available. Emissions to water, however, have not been \nreported. \n\n\u2022 It has been estimated, based on mass balance calculation, that 55% of the GenX used was incinerated \nand 40% recycled. The emissions to water and air were approximately 4% and 1% respectively. Based \non GenX usage of 50 tonnes in 2017, approximately 2 000 kg and 500 kg were emitted to water and \nair, respectively. \n\n\u2022 Wastewater directed to a treatment plant contained, on average, 0.15 micrograms per litre (\u00b5g/l) \nPFOA and 2.3 \u00b5g/l GenX (2017). Due to the higher water solubility of GenX than PFOA, the removal of \nGenX is less efficient in the municipal water treatment plant. \n\n\u2022 Generally, the detected concentrations of PFOA and GenX in surface and groundwater samples were \nlow, with concentrations decreasing further from the plant. \n\n\u2022 GenX and PFOA have been detected in leaves and grass within 3 kilometres northeast of the plant \nwith concentrations decreasing with distance. It was advised not to consume vegetables grown within \na radius of 1 kilometre of the plant (Brandsmaa, 2019). \n\n\u2022 The tolerable daily intake for PFOA and GenX was only exceeded in the maximum exposure scenario \nbased on year-round consumption of local vegetables and exposure to drinking water and air. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 39 \n\n4.9 Manufacturing/conversion of fluorinated polymers into final products \n\nIn addition to production sites, the manufacturing of fluorinated polymers, for example by conversion into \nfinal products, sintering or their application may also cause environmental contamination by, for example, \nPFAS. Information provided by companies to the United States Food and Drug Administration shows that \nsome types of fluorinated sidechain acrylate polymers may only be 88\u201391% retained when applied to foodcontact paper and board (EDF, 2018; Neltner and Maffini, 2018). Some is released to water and some \nretained in sludge which should be landfilled or incinerated \u2013 in the United States 80% is landfilled and \n20% incinerated. No such assessment is available in Europe, even though there are known occurrences of \naccidental releases in, for example, Germany and Italy (Goldenman et al., 2019; Ministerium f\u00fcr Umwelt, \nKlima und Energiewirtschaft Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 2018). \n\nAs an additional step, fluorinated polymers can also be applied as coatings to other surfaces, such as \ncooking utensils, by baking on and/or sintering at high temperatures of up to 420 \u00b0C for up to 10 minutes. \nMany materials and articles made using these coatings are intended for repeated use in contact with all \ntypes of foodstuffs. The conditions of use include short-time contact at temperatures up to around 100 \u00b0C \nfor food processing equipment and food contact articles. Contact conditions for high temperature \napplication coatings include 230 \u00b0C for 1\u20132 hours and may even reach 250 \u00b0C for a short time (EFSA, 2010). \nEmissions during the coating of products with fluorinated polymers can be cleaned by a two-stage air \npollution control device used to collect the submicron particulate matter released during the sintering of \nthe PTFE. The fibre-bed diffusion filters are designed to collect both solid and liquid particulates. \n\nDuring the manufacturing and conversion, PFAS processing aids, impurities and degradation products may \nbe released. For instance, processing aids, such as PFTECA (CAS no. 329238-24-6), are volatile and \ncompletely evaporate at 190 \u00b0C. PFTECA is soluble in water and in organic solvents but is expected to be \nstable to heat and not to react with food constituents. Considering the type of application, such as nonstick coatings on cookware, these coatings are processed at very high temperatures, above 300 \u00b0C. Under \nsuch conditions, any residues of the volatile substance and other migratable impurities will be removed \nefficiently (EFSA, 2010). To avoid atmospheric and other emissions, however, closed systems are required \nfor the manufacturing of fluorinated polymers. \n\n4.10 Knowledge gaps \n\n\u2022 Identity and usage of fluorine-containing fluorinated polymer production aids. \n\n\u2022 Emission data of fluorine-containing fluorinated polymer production aids (PFOA and PFNA \nalternatives) and other emitted PFAS. \n\n\u2022 Emission data of PFAS emissions during production of fluorine-containing fluorinated polymer \nproduction aids. \n\n\u2022 Physical-chemical properties of PFOA and PFNA alternatives including bioaccumulation potential \nand persistency. \n\n\u2022 Identity, usage and physical-chemical properties of poly- and perfluorinated sidechains used in \nfluorinated polymers. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 40 \n\n5 Use phase: uses and potential emissions from pollutants \n\nMain author: Elina Pohjalainen \nContributors: Dorte Herzke (Microplastics) and Elina Yli-Rantala (Degradation to micropowders) \n\nKey messages \n\n\u2022 Fluorinated polymers are used in a diverse range of applications due to their unique properties \nsuch as the ability to repel water/dirt and chemical stability. The transport, chemical and power \nsectors are the largest users of fluorinated polymers. \n\n\u2022 Typically, fluorinated polymers are only a part of component or in coatings. Thus, exposure is \nhighly application specific. Impacts of their use phase are not deeply analysed in this report \n\n\u2022 The use phase of fluorinated polymers may lead to PFAS entering the environment: \n\n\u2022 degradation of materials in use: for example, the wearing and tearing of durable, waterrepellent (DWR) textiles due to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high temperatures and humidity; \n\n\u2022 overheating of PTFE kitchenware; etc. \n\n\u2022 Direct human exposure during use phase: \n\n\u2022 dietary intake as a result of leaching of substances from food-contact materials into food; \n\n\u2022 inhalation as a result of indoor dust impacted by carpets, furniture, textiles and other surface \ntreated materials, heating or spaying products containing fluorinated polymers; \n\n\u2022 dermal contact from textiles and cosmetics/personal care products; \n\n\u2022 medical utensils such as implants or ophthalmic uses. \n\n\u2022 Microplastics: \n\n\u2022 released either directly into the environment due to intentional use in products, or indirectly \nafter the physical degradation of macro-sized fluorinated polymers in products or \nmismanaged waste; \n\n\u2022 microplastics end up in wastewater treatment plants and are not recovered. For example, \nfibres including fluorinated polymers are released from textiles during washing, cosmetics and \npersonal care products when they are washed off during/after use, etc. \n\n5.1 General remarks on the use of fluorinated polymers in different applications \n\nThe use of fluorinated polymers is widespread. The main industrial sectors using fluorinated polymers and \ntheir market shares are briefly discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. The transport, chemical and power sectors \nare the largest users of fluorinated polymers, accounting for approximately two-thirds of their sales in \nEurope. In the automotive industry, for example, fluorinated polymers make up approximately 350 grams \nper car and are used in items such as seals, gaskets and transmission components, as well as cables and \nhoses (Am\u00e9duri, 2020). Consumer products such as kitchenware, electronics and textiles are the next \nlargest users of fluorinated polymers. An interesting application of fluorinated polymers is in the \nrenewable energy sector where they are used in photovoltaic panels, fuel cells and batteries, all \nincreasingly important applications in the transition to a low carbon economy. Different applications for \nvarious fluorinated polymers are described in, for example, Puts et al. (2019), Am\u00e9duri, (2018; 2020), Dams \nand Hintzer (2017) and Gardiner (2015). \n\nPotential impacts of fluorinated polymers from the use phase are not the main focus in this report and \nimpacts from all potential uses are not thoroughly reviewed. Instead in the following sections, three \nexample cases of fluorinated polymer use are briefly presented, with an emphasis on PFAS releases to the \nenvironment as well as human exposure during use phase. The use and pollution from (PTFE) microplastics \nis also discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. More information on risks to human health and environment from \nPFAS can be found in, for example, a recent EEA briefing (EEA, 2019). Different pathways of human \nexposure to PFAS and their health effects are reviewed, for example, in Sunderland et al. (2019). In general, \ndirect human exposure to specific PFAS due to the use of products that contain them can be quickly phased \nout by shifts in product compositions, whereas much longer timescales must be expected for the \namelioration of their accumulation in groundwater and the wider environment. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 41 \n\n5.2 Fluorinated polymers in consumer products \n\n5.2.1 Textiles \u2013 outdoor clothing \n\nFluorinated polymers and sidechain fluorinated polymers are used in the textile industry because of their \nability to create water-, oil- and dirt-repellent surfaces (Kotthoff et al., 2015). An example of this type of \napplication is outdoor clothing made of multiple layers and different types of polymers. These fabrics \ntypically include a membrane made of extended PTFE, which is included in Gore-Tex and similar products. \nThis multiporous layer has high permeability for water vapour but low permeability for water molecules \n(Ebnesajjad, 2017). In addition, sidechain fluorinated polymers are used as finishes in the outer layer of \nfabrics to create water, oil and stain resistance. These finishes, also called DWR treatment, are typically \ncomposed of fluoroalkyl acrylates and (meth)acrylates (Knepper et al., 2014). \n\nOutdoor clothing and other DWR treated textiles are a potential source of PFAS into the environment \n(Holmquist et al., 2016; Knepper et al., 2014). Different routes for environmental contamination of \n(fluorinated) DWR substances are presented in Figure 5.1. High levels of volatile FTOHs, which are emitted \nto the air, have been detected in outdoor clothing (Knepper et al., 2014; Herzke et al., 2012). Another \nroute for PFAS to enter the environment is through washing, for example, the release of fibres coated with \nfluorotelomer-based polymers have been measured during washing (Schellenberger et al., 2019b; \nKnepper et al., 2014). The loss of PFAS from textiles can also occur in the use phase due to wearing and \ntearing. Ultraviolet radiation, high temperatures and humidity have been detected increasing \nperfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) concentrations in textiles due to degradation of DWR polymers such as FTOHs \n(van der Veen et al., 2020; Gremmel et al., 2016). \n\nThe ability of outdoor clothing to repel water typically diminishes after continuous use and repeated \nwashing cycles. Water repellency can be partly regained by using impregnating agents, but these are \nanother potential source of human exposure to PFAS through the inhalation of sprays and their release to \nthe environment. Fluorosilanes and FTOH substances have been detected in impregnating agents for \ntextiles and footwear (Knepper et al., 2014; Noergaard, 2010). Several incidents have been reported in \nEurope where short-term exposure to impregnating agents containing, in most cases, fluorinated polymers \nhave been associated with respiratory illness and other health problems (ECHA, 2017). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Possible mechanisms for loss of chemicals from DWR treated textiles during the use phase. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 42 \n\nSource: Holmquist et al. (2016) \n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend for reducing the use of long-chain sidechain fluorinated polymers \nin textile finishes and other consumer products (18). Substitution alternatives include short-chain sidechain \nfluorinated polymers or even completely fluorine-free finishes. Concerns have been raised, however, due \nto persistence and lack of data on the health effects for short-chain PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019; OECD, \n2013). Non-fluorinated DWR finishes might be a possibility for consumer products such as outdoor apparel \nas similar water-repellent properties can be achieved with non-fluorinated finishes (Hill et al., 2017). Nonfluorinated alternatives, however, do not perform as well as fluorinated ones in repelling oil \n(Schellenberger et al., 2019a; Holmquist et al., 2016) and might not be sufficient for use in, for example, \noccupational protective clothing (Cousins et al., 2019). \n\n5.2.2 Food-contact materials \n\nFood-contact materials (FCM) (19) cover a wide range of materials that may come into contact with food \nduring its production, processing, storage, preparation and serving. Examples include food-production \nequipment and machinery, packaging and kitchen utensils such as non-stick forms and pans. Many of these \nuse fluorinated polymers due to their ability to resist grease and water (Goldenman et al., 2019). Foodcontact materials are regulated in the EU by the framework regulation 1935/2004 on materials and articles \nintended to come into contact with food (EU, 2004). The principle underlying this regulation is that \u201cany \nmaterial or article intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food must be sufficiently inert \nto preclude substances from being transferred to food in quantities large enough to endanger human \nhealth or to bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the food or a deterioration in its \norganoleptic properties\u201d (20). \n\nNon-stick PTFE coatings are used various kitchenware, for example, in frying pans and other utensils \n(Cousins et al., 2019), due to their high chemical and thermal stability as well as oil/water repelling \nproperties. PTFE polymer coatings are considered to be of less concern than fluorinated substances in \npaper and cardboard packaging (21) due to the negligible release of PFAS during use (Bokkers et al., 2019). \nIf, however, they overheat, PFCAs can be emitted from heated PTFE kitchenware surfaces. There have \nbeen incidents of Teflon flu, or polymer fume fever, a medical condition arising from inhaling of PTFE and \nits thermal degradation products during use (Greenberg and Vearrier, 2015). These cases have been largely \nthe result of overheating PTFE-coated cooking equipment and the condition appears to be reversible but \nlong-term health impacts have not been assessed. No information has been published regarding the \nspecific compounds that lead to the flu-like symptoms. There seems to be no risk to human health at \nnormal application temperatures related to PFCA emissions from PTFE coated kitchenware based on \ncurrent tolerable daily intake (TDIs) according to some studies (Schlummer et al., 2015), whereas some \nearlier studies suggest that perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, originating from PFAS residues of the \nmanufacturing process, might be released from non-stick frying pans even at normal cooking \ntemperatures (Sinclair et al., 2007). \n\n \n18 For example, Polartec has announced the elimination of PFAS in its DWR treatments https://www.polartec.com/news/polartec\nannounces-full-use-of-non-pfas-dwr-treatments \n19 https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials_en \n20 Recently the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain published a draft scientific opinion on the risks to human health \n\nrelated to the presence of perfluoroalkyl substances in food (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, 2020). The draft \nopinion assesses four PFAS, namely PFOA, PFNA, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and PFOS, and recommends a tolerable \nweekly intake (TWI) of 8 nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg) of body weight per week for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS. \n\n21 Various PFAS are used in paper and cardboard packaging materials, for example, plates, popcorn bags, pizza boxes, fast-food \ncontainers and baking papers (Bokkers et al., 2019). Nowadays, typically short-chain fluorotelomer based polymers are used in \npaper and cardboard food-packaging materials (Cousins et al., 2019). PFAS, that are not allowed in food-contact materials, have \nalso been detected, possibly from impurities present in the substances used to treat paper and cardboard (Bokkers et al., 2019). \nPFAS in food-contact materials are a possible source for direct human exposure as PFAS can leach into food resulting in \nincreased dietary exposure. Microwave popcorn consumption, for example, has been associated with increased PFAS serum \nconcentrations, suggesting a leaching from the fluorinated coating of the food packaging (Susmann et al., 2019). \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials_en\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 43 \n\n5.2.3 Cosmetics and personal care products \n\nFluorinated substances are used in various cosmetics and personal care products, such as hair products, \nfoundations and powders in which they act as emulsifiers, antistatics, stabilisers, surfactants, film formers, \nviscosity regulators and solvents, amongst others, and their properties enable the production of water- \nand oil-repellent and weather resistant products (Brinch et al., 2018; Schultes et al., 2018). As a result, \nPFAS are found in cosmetic products as both ingredients and unintentional degradation products and \nimpurities from the production of precursors used in some cosmetic products. Cosmetics products \nincluding polyfluoroalkyl phosphates (PAPs), for example, have been reported to contain high levels of \nPFCAs either as impurities or degradation products of PAPs (Fujii et al., 2013). Foundations and powders \nhave particularly been shown to include perfluorinated carboxylic acids \u2013 perfluoroheptanoic acid and \nperfluorohexanoic acids \u2013and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (Schultes et al., 2018). \n\nA recent risk assessment of cosmetic products on the Danish market showed that a wide variety of \nfluoroalkyl substances and other fluorinated compounds are used in cosmetics, and PTFE was most often \nfound in different product types, followed by C9-15 fluoroalcohol phosphates (Brinch et al., 2018). According \nto the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, for example, PTFE is used in concentrations of up to 13% in such leaveon products as mascara, up to 3% in face powders and at concentrations of up to 2.4% in such rinse-off \nproducts as hair bleaches in the United States (Johnson, 2018b).  Brinch et al. (2018) measured PFAS \nconcentrations in cosmetics products that contained certain fluorinated substances in the ingredients list \nand carried out a risk assessment. Although PFAS were found in almost all products in varying \nconcentrations, it was concluded that measured PFCA concentrations did not pose a risk to consumers, \nalthough risk could not be completely ruled out if several products were used simultaneously (Brinch et \nal., 2018). \n\nDirect human exposure to PFAS from cosmetics occurs through skin contact; studies suggest that, for \nexample, PFOA penetrates human skin (Franko et al., 2012). Several studies reviewed in Sunderland et al. \n(2019) suggest, however, that the contribution of dermal contact to PFAS exposure is negligible when \ncompared to dietary intake, household dust or drinking water contamination. In addition to direct human \nexposure, environmental contamination from cosmetics can occur through wastewater treatment plants, \nbut the magnitude of such contamination is unknown (Goldenman et al., 2019). Pollution from fluorinated \nmicroplastics is briefly discussed in Section 5.4. Due to the risks of PFAS to health and the environment, \nseveral cosmetics brands have announced the phase out of PFAS in their products (Chemsec, 2018, 2019). \n\n5.3 Polytetrafluoroethylene micropowders/microplastics \n\nA large proportion of clean and unfilled PTFE scrap, which mainly originates from machining \noperations, is degraded thermally or by high-energy irradiation in order to radically reduce the molar \nmass of the material and finally create micropowder which is also a microplastic, typically with a \nparticle sized 2\u201320  \u03bcm (Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Lakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). The degradation \naims to reduce the length of the molecular chain to approximately 1% of the original (Pro-K, 2018). \nSuch micropowders can be used over a wide range of temperatures from -190 to 250 \u00b0C to provide \nnon-stick properties, improved lubricity, wear resistance and reinforcement, and are thus mainly \nused as additives in coatings, lubricants, oils, printing inks and plastics (Dams and Hintzer, 2017; \nLakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). These are mainly dispersive uses \nof PTFE microplastics resulting in their release indoors and to the wider environment over time. \n\nThe thermal degradation of PTFE occurs at about 500 \u00b0C in ovens, kneaders or extruders in commercially \nestablished processes. The resulting low-molecular-weight PTFE materials are then milled to \nmicropowders (Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). The degradation by irradiation can be performed by \nelectron beams, X-rays or gamma radiation. Degradation by irradiation is considered such a mature \ntechnique by the United States Food and Drug Administration that the generated micropowders may be \nused as additives in plastics that may come into repeated contact with food (Pro-K, 2018). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 44 \n\nAccording to Lakshmanan and Chakraborty (2015), however, the use of electron beams induces the \ngeneration of gases such as hydrogen fluoride vapour which should be ventilated from processing areas. \nThere is also evidence that other, long-chain PFAS are generated in the process (ECHA, 2015). The \ngeneration of hydrogen fluoride is much less notable in irradiation with gamma rays as the irradiation rate \nis several orders of magnitude less than that of electron beams. According to Makuuchi and Cheng (2011), \nhowever, the majority of irradiation is done using electron beams \u2013 Hintzer and Schwertfeger (2014) state \nthat the degradation of PTFE by electron beam irradiation is \u201ccommercially widely used\u201d by continuous \nprocesses. \n\nAlthough micropowders were first developed as a means of disposing of the PTFE scrap, they are also \nproduced from virgin materials (Ebnesajjad and Morgan, 2019; Lakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). The \nuse of secondary PTFE feedstocks for the generation of micropowder is much more accepted by the costdriven ink market than by other areas, as PTFE scrap is the cheapest source of micropowders. In addition, \nPTFE scrap often contains hydrocarbon contaminants, possibly causing colour defects, which can be less \nof a problem in coloured inks (Ebnesajjad and Morgan, 2019). \n\nIn 2010, the market for irradiated micropowder was assumed to be approximately 7,000\u201310,000 tonnes \nper year, of which the largest share was consumed in the United States. Recycling by irradiation to \nmicropowders has been shown to be a profitable means of adding value to PTFE scrap. About 60\u201370% of \nthe total volume of the world\u2019s PTFE micropowders was processed by companies providing toll irradiation \nservices in the early 2010s, whereas the rest was processed by PTFE manufacturers themselves (Makuuchi \nand Cheng, 2011). \n\n5.4 Microplastic pollutants from the use of fluorinated polymers \n\nAs for common polymers, micro-sized fluorinated polymers can be released either directly into the \nenvironment due to intentional use in products, or indirectly after physical degradation of macro-sized \nfluorinated polymers in products or mismanaged waste. One major intentional use application is in \ncosmetic products, both for leave-on and rinse-off products, as described in Section 5.2.3. It can be \nexpected that a large part of fluorinated polymer-containing cosmetics will be removed from the face \nduring daily cleaning routines, with a considerable share being washed down the drain, thereby entering \nwastewater effluent along with other microplastic particles. Most of today's wastewater treatment plants \n(WWTPs) are unable to remove large parts of the microplastic content from wastewater and, as a result, \nthey are emitted to receiving aqueous bodies. PTFE microplastics use in coatings, lubricants, oils, printing \ninks and plastics, another potential source of fluorinated microplastic pollutants to the environment, is \ndescribed in Section 5.3. \n\nLittle is known about the environmental processes that lead to the accelerated sinking and sedimentation \nof microplastics in aqueous environments. It is not understood, for example, whether or not biofouling \noccurs with fluorinated polymers, as it does with other microplastic types, due to the special chemicalphysical properties of fluorinated polymer surfaces. It can, however, be assumed that the chemical \ninertness and general persistency of fluorinated polymers to environmental degradation and weathering \nwill result in their even slower removal from the environment compared with other common microplastic \nparticles. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 45 \n\n6 End-of-life phase: Waste management and potential emissions of pollutants \n\nMain authors: Margareta Wahlstr\u00f6m, Elina Yli-Rantala, David Behringer, Dorte Herzke, Stephen Mudge \nand Elina Pohjalainen \nContributors: VTT (Recycling; degradation of products in the environment); NILU and \u00d6ko-Recherche \n(Degradation of products in the environment; degradation due to thermal stress) \n\nKey messages: \n\n\u2022 Recycling: \n\n\u2022 A very low percentage of fluorinated polymers is recycled due to their use in a wide range of \napplications and their low share in end-of-life products. \n\n\u2022 Recycling activities are mainly concentrated on production scrap because large amounts of \nwaste are generated during the production of fluorinated polymers. The majority of \nfluorinated polymers from end uses end up in landfill or are incinerated. The barriers to \nrecycling are mostly technical. \n\n\u2022 Thermal treatment: \n\n\u2022 Fluorinated polymers start degrading at relatively low temperatures (> 200 \u00b0C) and up to \napproximately 1 100 \u00b0C after which mineralisation to HF occurs. Which degradation products \nare formed depends on a number of physical and chemical conditions? Examples include \nvolatile and ionic/water-soluble compounds such as TFA; volatile fluorinated gases some of \nwhich are GHG; oligomers; and nano- and micro-particles. Emissions of PFAS are likely to occur \nfrom uncontrolled thermal treatment below 1 100 \u00b0C that does not capture the volatile PFAS. \n\n\u2022 Low temperature heating is used in some processes to strip fluorinated polymers, for instance \nto regenerate metal baking surfaces before recoating them with fluoropolymers, or to strip \nfluoropolymers from lithium-ion batteries to recover metals. Studies, however, do not \nmention or indicate that volatiles including PFAS are captured. \n\n\u2022 Most EU waste incineration occurs at relatively high temperatures, 850\u20131,150 \u00b0C, through \nwhich HF is mostly formed and captured by scrubbers. It is not known if, and to what extent, \nvolatile PFAS are captured. \n\n\u2022 There is no data on PFAS emissions from the thermal degradation (smouldering) of electronic \nand other wastes containing fluorinated polymers, shipped beyond the EU for recycling. \n\n\u2022 Plastic pyrolysis, chemical recycling, at temperature below 600 \u00b0C has been promoted in recent \nyears in the United States and Europe and small-scale plastic pyrolysis of mixed polymer inputs \nis carried out mixed polymer input such countries as India and Pakistan.  It is not known if, and \nto what extent, volatiles are captured. \n\n\u2022 Landfilling: \n\n\u2022 Consumer products containing PFAS have previously been landfilled and it is likely that \nlandfilling still occurs in some EU Member States. \n\n\u2022 Landfill sites may be a source of the very persistent PFAS leaching from impurities in \nfluorinated polymers and from the degradation of fluorinated sidechain polymers. In addition, \nfluorinated non-ionic gasses such as FTOHs may be formed and emitted to the atmosphere. \nEmissions may occur a long time after closure of landfills. \n\n\u2022 Landfill leachates are often treated in wastewater treatment plants which are not designed to \nremove persistent chemicals such as PFAS chemicals. Cost efficient methods are needed to \nreduce PFAS in landfill leachates. \n\n\u2022 There is also lack of harmonised protocols for sampling and analysing leachates. \n\n\u2022 To improve the estimation of long-term impacts, there is a need to better understand key \nfactors influencing the degradation of fluorinated polymers and the leaching mechanisms of \nPFAS in landfills. \n\n\u2022 Discharge of PFAS from fluorinated polymers treated in wastewater treatment plants: \n\n\u2022 There is little information on the influx of fluorinated polymers and emissions of ionic and \nvolatile to air from wastewater treatment plants; \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 46 \n\n\u2022 There is little information on the presence, levels and contributions of fluorinated polymers to \nPFAS in municipal sludge, and how much from households as opposed light industry. This \ninformation is needed to assess the contribution of PFAS from fluorinated polymers to \nagricultural and other soils, treated with wastewater treatment plant sludge. Management of \nurban wastewater treatment plant sludge differs among EU Member States. \n\n6.1 General consideration of waste management \n\nIn Chapter 6, circularity aspects in waste management of fluorinated polymers containing waste is \nanalysed, especially assessing the possibilities to turn the waste management towards circularity. Waste \nmanagement currently tends to rely on a linear economic model of take, make, use and dispose of. In a \nCE, the circularity is ensured in all phases of the lifecycle by maintaining the value of the material and \nproducts in the loop for as long as possible and reducing the escape of resources, thus minimising impacts \nduring different lifecycle stages. Waste landfilling and incineration are avoided as long as possible. \nNonetheless, legislative requirements of waste management need to be followed. \n\nAs previously discussed, fluorinated polymers are used in a wide range of applications, especially in the \ntransport, energy and chemistry sectors, as well as in construction and consumer products (Am\u00e9duri, 2020; \n2018). From a waste management perspective, fluorinated polymers are typically incorporated in products \nsuch as in membranes, O-rings, mantling/covers, coatings, and electric insulators to provide them with \nspecific properties. As a result, it is often not either possible or manageable to separate the thin layers \ncontaining fluorinated polymers. Moreover, when products enter the waste stage depends on their \nlifespans which can vary from just a few months to decades for some products such as cars, photovoltaic \npanels, medical implants, buildings, and electronic equipment. \n\nWaste from consumer products, such as textiles, carpets and furniture containing fluorinated polymers, \nend up in the municipal waste stream. Textiles, which make up around 4% of all municipal solid waste \n(Taylor et al., 2014), are important in this context as they may include fabrics that have been treated with \nor contain membranes of fluorinated polymers, primarily to enhance stain resistance and provide \nwaterproofing. Carpets are also frequently treated with fluorinated polymers to improve their stain \nresistance. \n\nWithin the EU, the vast majority of waste generated by consumers is collected and disposed of centrally \nthrough a range of recycling and other options. The management of municipal waste differs between \nMember States but, on average, 48% was recycled, 29% incinerated and 23% landfilled in 2018 (Eurostat, \n2020). Impacts of incineration and landfilling, particularly of municipal waste, are discussed further in \nSections 6.4 and 6.5. \n\nOpen waste or backyard burning is a relatively rare in Europe (Cogut, 2016). This type of combustion \ntypically occurs with low oxygen availability in a barrel at relatively low temperatures compared to \nregulated municipal incineration sites. In less developed countries and in the rural areas of the United \nStates, for instance, a significant percentage of the total waste generated is incinerated at low \ntemperatures \u2013 Cogut (2016) estimates that 41% of global waste is burned this way. There is a high risk of \nthe release of toxic emissions (dioxins and POPs) in open burning of plastics and electronic waste. \nElectronic waste has in the past been imported in large quantities from developed countries by developing \nones, especially Africa, often for the recovery of valuable metals. \n\nIn the transport sector, applications containing fluorinated polymers typically have long lifespans in \ncontrast to the electronics sector where the lifespans vary depending on the application. Waste arising \nfrom the automotive and electronic sectors typically end up in metal shredding plants and are often \ntreated jointly for the recovery of metals with a high monetary value. In the shredding plants, \nreusable/recyclable plastic fractions \u2013 bumpers, fuel tanks and some plastics from electronics \u2013 are \nremoved prior to shredding. Potentially coated metals and those with tightly attached components are \nsent for metal recovery in high temperature smelters. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 47 \n\nIt is estimated that a typical car contains around 350 grams of fluorinated polymers (Am\u00e9duri, 2018). This \ncorresponds to 4,200 tonnes of fluorinated polymers ending as waste from vehicles in Europe each year, \ngiven that around 12 million vehicles a year are deregistered and sent to waste. Within a few years, the \namount of fluorinated polymers in cars is forecast to increase to 1\u20132 kilograms (Am\u00e9duri, 2020), \nconsiderably increasing the amount of affected waste. In the shredding of vehicles, the plastic fraction, \nexcluding bumpers, fuel tanks and batteries, ends up in the light fraction of the shredder waste, which \nconsists of a mixture of plastics, rubber, wood and other non-metal residuals \u2013 typically around 30% is \nplastics (Zevenhoven and Saeed, 2002). According data from 20 European countries (Eurostat, 2020), \nabout 0.86 million tonnes of shredder waste were treated in 2017 of which 34% was landfilled, 33% \nincinerated with energy recovery and 33% recycled. \n\nIn renewable energy production, fluorinated polymers provide desired functionality to applications. \nWastes from photovoltaic panels are an emerging and growing waste stream after a lifespan of 25\u201330 \nyears (Deng et al., 2019). Backsheets, containing fluorinated polymers, can be peeled off from modules at \nelevated temperatures or can be mechanically separated before the solar cells are recycled, but the \nresidue after the recovery of such valuable metals as aluminium, copper, silver and steel, is for cost reasons \ntypically sent for incineration or landfilled. Section 7.6 presents a comparison of environmental impacts \nfrom waste management of backsheets with fluorine-free and fluorinated polymers. Other energy related \ndevices in which fluorinated polymers play an important role, including fuel cells, rechargeable batteries \nand other applications for energy capture, are now entering the waste stream after 10\u201320 years. The \napplications often contain valuable metals, critical raw materials such as cobalt in lithium-ion batteries and \nplatinum in fuel cells, that are recovered by pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical processes. It is not \nclear to what extent these wastes are exported beyond Europe for metal recovery. \n\nFluorinated polymers are used in numerous electronic applications due to their dielectric properties and \nchemical stability. The share of the fluorinated polymer is, however, typically rather low relative to the \ntotal weight of the application. In addition, not only the small share of fluorinated polymers, but also the \npoor separability of the polymers limits their recyclability. For example, in lithium-ion batteries PVDF, \nwhich is used as a binder in the electrode layer, makes up just 1\u20132 wt% of the total (Mossali et al., 2020). \nThe major driver for recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries is the economic value of metals, cobalt and \nnickel, in the cathode layer, whereas feasibility of recycling of polymers is rather low. As mentioned earlier, \nvarious industrial processes for metal recovery exist combining, for example, pyrometallurgical and \nhydrometallurgical approaches, however details of the processes or pre-treatment methods used by the \nrecycling industry are not widely available. While the formation of harmful decomposition products of the \nbinder and electrolyte, which also contains containing fluoride, is well documented during thermal \nrunaway of the battery cells, gas emissions from recycling processes have received less attention. A \nrecently published study describes the decomposition of PVDF binders starting from 386 \u00b0C with a \nmaximum peak for fluoride-containing gases at 522 \u00b0C (Chen et al., 2019). Attention is thus needed on the \nend-of-life management of the applications to deal with toxic emissions that may be formed in the thermal \ntreatment in certain conditions. \n\nThe risks for uncontrolled emissions at commercial bakeries have been raised up by Lohmann et al. \n(Lohmann et al., 2020). In bakeries, fluoropolymer coatings are regularly removed from baking forms after \n12\u221224 months of use either by burning or blasting, with unknown emissions of PFAS and fluoropolymer \nparticles to air, water, and soil, and then the forms are recoated. In the thermal treatment, the old coating \nis burned off at 450 \u00b0C over 4\u22125 hours, followed by blasting by grit or water at 1 500 bar. \n\nFluorinated polymer products are also used in buildings in, for example, facades and coatings to improve \nwetting properties, and paint or surface treatment applications such as coatings, lacquers, and stains \n(Janousek et al., 2019). Fluorinated polymers may also be used in adhesives for timbers due to their \nultraviolet transparency and beneficial weight-to-surface ratio. Fluorinated polymers can also replace glass \nin solar panels, greenhouses, or buildings\u2019 sunroofs because they have good dirt and water repelling \nproperties. Due to the long lifespans of buildings, the wastes are generated decades after construction \nand it is likely that these types of waste are yet to be removed from buildings. Today, a major concern is \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 48 \n\nthe release of PFAS to the environment near construction sites due to the weathering of products in \ncontact with rainwater. Products from the renovation or demolition of buildings are typically disposed of \nin landfills for mineral wastes. As stony construction waste and metals can largely be recovered to use in \nnew applications, they must be free of pollutants. Coated surfaces are therefore problematic for recovery, \nespecially in high-grade recycling. Fabrics are treated as municipal waste and incinerated or landfilled \ndepending on the country. Releases from construction waste containing PFAS have only been addressed \nin a few articles. \n\nBox 6.1 Focus on hazardous waste and waste containing POPs \n\nWaste is classified as hazardous or non-hazardous. Hazardous waste is a waste that, due to its (intrinsic) \nchemical or other properties poses a risk to the environment and/or human health. The classification is \nprimarily based on the European List of Waste (LoW) (2014/955/EU) or based on a waste\u2019s hazardous \nproperties. In the LoW, wastes are primarily categorised as hazardous, non-hazardous, or potentially \nhazardous/non-hazardous according to their origin or source \u2013 for example, electronic wastes are \nclassed as hazardous whereas textile waste from households are deemed to be non-hazardous. In some \ncases, a particular type of waste on the list can be either hazardous or non-hazardous depending on its \nspecific properties and in these cases the waste status has to be assessed based on its hazardous \nproperties. The European Commission\u2019s Regulations No 1357/2014 and 2017/997 define the hazardous \nproperties for hazardous waste classification referring to assessment methods developed in the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP). For example, the \nhazardous classification limits for the content of PFOS and PFOA in waste are given in Table 6.1. \n\nThe waste classification has several implications. There are numerous EU regulations, including the \nWaste Shipment Regulation (Regulation EC No 1013/2006 and Regulation EU No 660/2014), the Landfill \nDirective (1999/33/EC), the waste acceptance criteria at landfill (Council Decision 2003/33/EC), the \nIndustrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive \n(85/337/EEC), setting special requirements for waste defined as hazardous. The Waste Shipment \nRegulation (WSR) (No. 1013/2006), for example, requires permits for the export or import of hazardous \nwaste both within EU and between the EU and OECD countries outside the EU and bans exports to OECD \ncountries. \n\nThe Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, adopted by the EU Regulation (EU) \n2019/1021 on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which is a revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004, requires \nwastes containing substances listed in Annex IV to the Regulation and exceeding certain concentration \nlimits to be destroyed and not circulated in new products. Products containing POPs may, however, \ncontinue to be used. Both PFOS and PFOA are examples of the POPs (Table 6.1). The list of these \npollutants is continually updated by the addition of new substances. Limits for POPs and hazardous \nwaste classifications differ meaning that wastes containing POPs may be classified as hazardous or nonhazardous depending on whether the hazardous waste limit has been exceeded. Textiles containing \nPOPs, for example, are classified as non-hazardous, and following collection may be sent for recycling if \nnot removed by skilled personnel at waste collection centres. \n\nTable 6.1. Examples of PFOS and PFOA limit values above which the waste is considered as hazardous or as POP \nwaste if either or both are exceeded. \n\nChemical Limit for hazardous waste, mg/kg (Commission \nRegulations No 1357/2014, 2017/997) \n\nLimit for POP waste, mg/kg (Regulation (EU) No 2019/1021 ) \n\nPFOS 3 000 50 (Annex IV) (i) \n\nPFOA 3 000 No limits presented in Annex IV (ii)  \n\ni) Potentially to be revised according to European Commission Staff working paper COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT Poly- and \nperfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 2020 (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/chemicals/2020/10/SWD_PFAS.pdf). \n\nii) Annex I of POP regulation: prohibition (with specific exemptions) on manufacturing, placing on the market and use if limits exceeding: \n0.025 mg/kg for PFOA and any of its salts, 1 mg/kg for each PFOA-related compound and a combination of PFOA-related compounds, \n20 mg/kg for PFOA-related compounds in substances as a transported isolated intermediate for the manufacture of fluorochemicals \nwith a carbon chain of no more than 6 atoms and 1 mg/kg for PFOA and its salts in PTFE micropowders produced by specific techniques, \nas well as mixtures and articles for industrial and professional uses containing PTFE powder. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/chemicals/2020/10/SWD_PFAS.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 49 \n\n6.2 Recycling \n\nAcross the world, 60% of fluorinated polymers in products is currently landfilled, and 12% are incinerated \n(Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Geyer et al., 2017; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). Of the remaining 28% only \na minor part is recycled. \n\nContrary to most other plastics, there is a notable economic incentive in recycling fluoroplastics due to \ntheir high value and stability (Ebnesajjad and Khaladkar, 2005). Recycling activities are, however, mainly \nconcentrated on scrap from production and manufacturing, which generate large amounts of fluorinated \npolymer wastes (Schlipf and Schwalm, 2014). This is especially the case for the manufacturing of semifinished parts and end-use articles made of PTFE, the processing steps, such as moulding, sintering, \nmachining and cutting, which usually produce 10\u201330% waste and in some cases more than 50% (Dams and \nHintzer, 2017). If 10\u201330% waste is assumed for all uses of PTFE and its annual global production is taken \nas the 2015 figure of 140 000 tonnes (Chapter 2), global PTFE process waste would be in the range 14 000\u2013\n42 000 tonnes. For Europe, with a production capacity of 52 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers per year, \nmostly consisting of PTFE, process wastes would be 5 200\u201315 600 tonnes annually. \n\nThe barriers for recycling of fluorinated polymers in products are mostly technical: a major part of the enduse of fluorinated polymers is scattered over a variety of uses in often complex products. In these, the \namount of fluorinated polymers is often low compared to other materials, and dedicated recovery is \ntherefore not put in place for the variety of products. It may also be difficult to collect some products for \nrecycling, such as wire and cable insulation, printed circuit boards in electronics, seals and hoses from the \ntransport sector, coatings of metal surfaces in various areas, medical applications such as ligament \nreplacements, coated fabrics and films for buildings and windmill wings, additives in inks and lubricants, \nand tubing and valves in the chemical and semiconductor industry (Am\u00e9duri, 2020). Given that the global \nrecycling rate of all plastics is approximately 9% (Geyer et al., 2017), it can safely be assumed that the \nrecycling rate of end-of-life fluorinated polymers is substantially lower. \n\nThis study did not find examples of full-scale recycling of fluorinated polymers themselves. However, from \none type of fluoropolymer production, a synthesis by-product is captured and sold for use as a refrigerant \n(United Nations Environment Programme, 2018). Studies conducted in laboratories or small-scale kilns do, \nhowever, indicate that wastes containing PFAS, when mixed together with calcium, will form CaF2, which \nis incorporated into cement and as such is recycled (Section 6.5). Whether the levels captured are high \nenough to make fluorine extraction worthwhile depends on many factors such as the efficiency and cost \nof the extraction compared to virgin materials, and also how critical the supply of fluorine becomes, which \nis not assessed in this report. \n\n6.2.1 Mechanical recycling \n\nMost melt-processable fluoroplastics, such as PVDF, can be recycled in a similar way to other commodity \nthermoplastics, that is, by re-melting through extrusion (Drobny, Jiri G., 2017; Ebnesajjad and Khaladkar, \n2005). There are companies carrying out PVDF recycling in the United States (22,23,24) and Europe (25,26,27), \nand at least one of the major fluoroplastic producers has, in 2013, released a range of PVDF products based \non recycled PVDF scrap. The scrap originates from their own production process, as well as from postmoulding processes at their customers\u2019 sites (Solvay, 2013). \n\nPTFE scrap, such as shavings and machine cuttings, is recycled by different methods from conventional \nthermoplastics because it does not melt when heated, but only softens at temperatures above 327 \u00b0C and \ntherefore, re-melting by extrusion cannot be used. Instead, PTFE scrap can be ground into fine powder \n\n \n22 https://www.polycleantech.com/pvdf/ \n23 https://powerplasticrecycling.com/pvdf-plastic/ \n24 http://www.prsei.com/recycling/material/30-pvdf \n25 https://www.mcam.com/en/recycling-solutions/ \n26 https://repolymer.de/?lang=en \n27 https://www.m-chemical.co.jp/en/news/2020/1208424_7667.html \n\nhttps://www.polycleantech.com/pvdf/\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 50 \n\nand sintered under pressure in compression moulding, or used in ram extrusion (Drobny and Jiri, 2017; \nLakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). Before grinding, the scrap is usually shredded and heated to remove \nany volatile contaminants. After grinding, the powder is treated with acids, such as a mixture of nitric and \nperchloric acids, to dissolve inorganics, after which it is washed (Ebnesajjad and Morgan, 2019; \nLakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). \n\nThe recycled PTFE powder cannot be used for the same applications as virgin PTFE since it cannot be \nmoulded in a similar fashion. Furthermore, it is off-white, which also decreases its value. Recycled PTFE \nhas, however, certain advantages over its virgin equivalent, such as better wear resistance (Lakshmanan \nand Chakraborty, 2015). The use of micropowder PFTE is also discussed in Section 5.3 and microplastic \npollutants from the use of fluorinated polymers in Section 5.4. \n\nIn industrial terms, in its recycled form PTFE is known as reprocessed or repro PTFE, or mechanical grade \nPTFE. Most commonly, the recycled powder is mixed with virgin PTFE and used in cost-driven applications \nin which high purity is not required, such as in non-critical chemical, electrical and mechanical applications. \nIt is not the choice for pharmaceutical, food-contact materials, cosmetics or medical applications \n(Lakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). \n\nThe recycling route described above only exists for unfilled, or virgin, PTFE. In contrast, there is a lack of \nlarge-scale recycling technologies for PTFE compounds. This primarily results from the presence of a large \nvariety of different fillers, such as glass fibre, graphite, carbon, metal compounds, ceramics and pigments \nin variable concentrations (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). \n\nWhereas recycling of production scrap takes place, recycling of fluorinated polymers from industrial or \ncommercial applications is challenging. A pilot-scale study (Rubino et al., 2021) has been conducted in Italy \nfocussing on mechanical recycling of the backsheet polymer (PVF based film \u2013 Tedlar) from photovoltaic \npanels and also the thermal recovery of valuable metals. It was demonstrated that the polymer can be \neffectively separated from the milled coarse fraction of end-of-life photovoltaic modules (>3 mm) using a \ncyclohexane solvent treatment and subsequent filtration operation for recovery of the Tedlar fraction. For \nan optimised process, it was estimated that 4.3 kg of polymer of high purity can be recovered from 100 kg \nof input material of milled photovoltaic panels. The applicability of the recovered polymer was not part of \nthe study. The authors also emphasise that the recovery process prevents the release of toxic components \nfrom the fluoropolymer backsheet in thermal metal recovery. \n\n6.2.2 Pyrolysis \n\nDepolymerisation by pyrolysis, also referred to as high-temperature conversion (HTC), is effectively the \nonly recycling method applicable to end-of-life fluoroplastic components. In this, fluoroplastics are \ndecomposed into their monomers at temperatures above 600 \u00b0C in the absence of oxygen (Dams and \nHintzer, 2017; Schlipf and Schwalm, 2014). In 2015, the chemical company Dyneon commissioned a pilot \npyrolysis plant that claimed to be the first fluorinated polymer up-cycling facility in the world. Up-cycling \nrefers to recycling in which the material quality is improved rather than downgraded. The plant was \nconstructed in Germany and it has a capacity of treating 500 tonnes of fluorinated polymer waste per year \n(PlastEurope, 2015). Suitable materials for Dyneon\u2019s pyrolysis process include the perfluorinated polymers \nPTFE, PFA and FEP, even with mineral fillers, and it is claimed to produce the monomers TFE and HFP with \na recovery rate of 90\u201395% (Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Schlipf and Schwalm, 2014). It is claimed that each \ntonne of TFE produced by the HTC process saves 5 tonnes of Cl, 10 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 1.6 tonnes \nof CaF2, 2 tonnes of sulphuric acid and 10 tonnes of CO2 emissions (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). \n\nIn addition, pyrolysis of mixed plastics to produce fuel has occurred in recent decades in the United States \nand Asian countries using carpets and auto-shredder residue as feedstocks (OCEAN RECOVERY ALLIANCE, \n2015; 4R Sustainability, Inc, 2011), which may contain fluorinated polymers. Furthermore, plastic pyrolysis \nplants are operated in developing countries with mixed plastic inputs for fuel production (Banu et al., 2020; \nBeston, 2020). These pyrolysis plants are normally operated at temperatures below 650 \u00b0C in which the \nthermal degradation of fluorinated polymers result in toxic emissions including toxic nano- and \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 51 \n\nmicroparticles (Boucher et al., 2000; Seidel et al., 1991; Waritz, 1975) and such PFAS as PFOA (Ochi et al., \n2008). There is no published study that assesses pilot and full-scale pyrolysis processes for PFAS and other \ntoxic degradation products from fluorinated polymer degradation. \n\n6.3 Emissions of PFAS to water, soil and air from wastewater treatment plants \n\nEmissions of PFAS from wastewater treatment plants have been studied to some extent, mostly the \nreleases of PFAAs into water and less for releases to air and its content in sludge. In this chapter the overall \nprocesses are described but not in great detail. Also, a broad range of ionic PFAS are detectable in \nwastewater treatment plant effluents, but a direct link to fluorinated polymer production and use might \nbe overshadowed by the plethora of alternative PFAS emission sources. \n\nWastewater treatment plants are classified by regulation as urban and industrial facilities and are referred \nto as urban and industrial wastewater treatment plants respectively. In both, influent water is treated and \nthe effluent wastewater is let into surface or marine waters. \n\nDuring the treatment process, PFAS processing agents, impurities and degradation products, as well as the \nfluorinated polymers themselves, may be released to air, water or be precipitated into the plant\u2019s sludge. \nThe partially or non-degraded fluorinated polymers may be present in solution or dispersion or be in the \nform of nano- or microplastics. \n\nThe PFAS degradation products will distribute into different media depending on their physical-chemical \ncharacteristics: \n\n\u2022 Air: volatile degradation products, such as FTOHs, FTSs and potentially other small PFAS volatiles \nsuch as fluoroform (CHF3). It has been shown that FTOHs have air residual times of more than 20 \ndays, which makes them long range transboundary air pollutants. Indeed, emissions of FTOHs have \nbeen shown to be a source of the PFAAs in the Arctic (D\u2019eon and Mabury, 2011). Neutral (nonionic) \nand ionic PFAS may be emitted to air, both in the gas-phase and through aerosols. A number of \nvolatile per- and polyfluorinated compounds have been detected in the air above the influent of \nselected wastewater treatment plants (Coggan et al., 2019). Atmospheric emissions dominate \nFTOHs emissions from wastewater treatment plants but emissions to the aquatic environment \nhave been shown to be significant during seasons with less wind in a study conducted near Beijing \n(Chen et al., 2020). \n\n\u2022 Water: short-chain and water soluble PFAAs, such as PFCAs and PFTCAs which are the \nintermediate transformation products from 6:2 FTOH sidechain polymers, such as 5:3 \nfluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 FTCA) (Coggan et al., 2019). Additionally, PFPEs used in \nfluoropolymers such as GenX, F-53B and Adona will partition to the water phase. Several of these \nare or form persistent and mobile chemicals. \n\n\u2022 Sludge: nano- and microplastic fluoropolymers, fluorinated sidechain polymers in dispersion or \nadhering to particulate matter such as dust or textile and paper fibres, and long-chain PFAS (PFAAs \nand other PFAS) that have low or no water solubility will end up in the sludge. All neutral (nonionic) \nPFAS that are not volatile will partition to the sludge. \n\n6.3.1 Urban wastewater treatment plants \n\nPFAS from fluorinated polymers in urban wastewater treatment plants come from both households and \nfrom light industry. Which contributes the most varies depending on the number and type of smaller \nindustry in the catchment area using these chemicals. A study conducted in Sweden in 2014\u20132015 suggests \nthat levels of total organofluorine and unidentified PFAS in wastewater treatment plant sludge are more \nrelated to types of industry rather than the number of households connected to the plants in that area \n(Yeung et al., n.d.). A review summarising the occurrence of PFAS in water and wastewater environments \nshows very large differences in various PFAS concentrations in wastewater influents/effluents which was \nexplained by the origin of wastewater from either domestic, or PFAS non-intensive or intensive industrial \nwastewater (Phong Vo et al., 2020). Wastewater treatment plants downstream of the aqueous fire\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 52 \n\nfighting foam (AFFF) industry and firefighting training grounds, for example, receive high PFAS \nconcentrations. A monitoring study conducted in Italy in 2010\u20132013 investigating the occurrence of PFAA \nin the aqueous environment and drinking water concluded that wastewater treatment plants receiving \nindustrial wastes discharged up to 50 times the PFAA loads of plants receiving municipal wastes (Castiglioni \net al., 2015). \n\nWhile there are studies investigating release of PFAS from fluorinated sidechain polymers in textiles, there \ndo not seem to be studies specifically looking at how much fluorinated polymers contribute to PFAS levels \ncompared to fluorinated non-polymers. Examples of household sources are the release of PFAS from \nfluorinated sidechain polymers from washing textiles, dust and fibres on coated furniture, floor and \nsurface polishes and spreading agents in detergents and excretion after human ingestion. Another possible \nsource is recycled toilet paper, since recycled paper for food contact has been shown to contain PFAS from \nsizing and coatings, although there do not seem to be studies of toilet paper as a potential source of these \nchemicals. All types of fluorinated polymers used by light industry could be emitted (Gl\u00fcge et al., 2020). \nExamples of sources include textile, glass, wood and steel coating manufacturers; commercial printers; \nand paint and electronics manufacturers as well as the use of detergents and food companies. Another \nsource could be run-off from urban areas and roads into the water sewage system. Other sources could \nbe the result of abrasion of buildings, products and vehicles as well as from industrial uses and leaks, which \ncould contain both fluorinated polymers and fluoropolymer nano- and microplastics. \n\nUrban wastewater treatment plants are classified as having primary, secondary and tertiary watertreatment processes. The primary process is a simple sedimentation of particulate matter from the water; \nsecondary treatment involves sedimentation and filtration typically through sand or soil; while tertiary \ntreatment involves sedimentation, filtration and biological degradation. All processes can also involve \naeration of the water. None of these traditional wastewater treatments \u2013 coagulation, flocculation, \nsedimentation, micro/ultrafiltration, oxidation (chlorination, ozonation and advanced oxidation processes \n[AOPs]) and UV irradiation \u2013 however, are designed to degrade persistent chemicals, meaning that, \ntypically, urban wastewater treatment plants do not remove PFAS from water or sludge (CMD Smith, \n2020). Full-scale conventional treatment, including coagulation followed by physical separation processes, \nand chemical oxidation, aeration and disinfection, has, for example, been reported ineffective at removing \nPFAS such as PFSAs and PFCAs (Appleman et al., 2014). \n\nActivated carbon adsorption, ion exchange and high pressure membrane processes (nanofiltration and \nreverse osmosis) may be more effective treatment technologies for PFAS removal from water (CMD Smith, \n2020; Franke, 2020). These techniques have been shown effective for the removal of various PFAS in \ndrinking water production (Franke et al., 2021), however their implementation on wastewater effluents is \nchallenged due to the high total organic carbon content (CMD Smith, 2020). Advanced oxidation and \nreduction processes are also much researched for PFAS removal from water, but mostly at a laboratory \nscale and their full potential is yet to be evaluated (Ahmed, 2020). \n\nAs the removal of PFAS from the wastewater effluents and sewage sludge is poor, wastewater treatment \nplants are significant point sources for PFAS emissions to the environment. Studies from all over the world \nexist, in which PFAS levels are measured in wastewater effluents and sludge. In a recent study conducted \nin Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, for example, 99 \nconventional and emerging PFAS were screened in various environmental samples including wastewater \ntreatment plant effluents and sludge. Effluent samples contained a mix of PFAS classes including PFCAs, \nPFSAs, ultrashort PFAS (mainly perfluoropropionic acid [PFPrA]) and PFCA precursors in a concentration \nrange 34\u2013113 ng/l (K\u00e4rrman et al., 2019). Sludge samples, on the other hand, were dominated by PFCA \nprecursors, on average accounting for 75% of all identified PFAS, and mainly contributed by different \nisomers of polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters (diPAPs). The study highlighted the low level of \nidentified PFAS when compared to the total extractable organic fluorine (EOF) in wastewater treatment \nplant effluents and sludge. Another example is an Australian study which analysed 21 different PFAS in \naqueous and solid samples from nineteen treatment plants (Coggan et al., 2019). The mean concentration \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 53 \n\nof 21 PFAS measured in aqueous samples was 110 nanograms28 per litre (ng/l), which results in a rough \nestimate of 339 kg of PFAS discharged per year from Australian wastewater treatment plants in effluents. \nAs in many previous studies, concentrations of some compounds (perfluoropentanoic acid [PFPeA], \nperfluorohexanoic acid [PFHxA], perfluoroheptanoic acid [PFHpA], PFOA, PFNA, and perfluorodecanoic \nacid [PFDA]) increased significantly between influent and final effluent due to the degradation of \nprecursors to stable PFAAs. \n\nTable 6.2 presents an overview on findings of selected European monitoring studies for PFAS in \nwastewater treatment plant effluents/sludges conducted in 2008\u20132018. \n\nTable 6.2. Main findings of selected PFAS monitoring studies related to releases from wastewater treatment plants in \nEurope. \n\nLocation Main findings in the studies Reference \n\nNordic countries (Denmark, \nFaroe Islands, Finland, \nGreenland, Iceland, Norway \nand Sweden), 2016\u20132017 \n\n99 PFAS were screened in various environmental samples and \ncompared to the total extractable organic fluorine (EOF) content. \nDetected average total PFAS concentration were 34\u2013113 ng/l in \neffluents and 36.8\u2013142 ng/g in sludge samples. The target analysis \nof PFAS could explain 9 % of the measured EOF for plant sludge and \n11% for plant effluents, \n\n(K\u00e4rrman et al., \n2019) \n\nBelgium (Wallonia and the \nBrussels Capital Region), 2015\u2013\n2018 \n\nEnvironmental monitoring study in Wallonia and the Brussels Capital \nRegion on a multitude of hazardous substances, including several \nPFAS. For surface water measurements from wastewater treatment \nplants, PFHxS and PFOA were detected in all samples; PFHpA and \nPFOS were found in 95 % of all samples; and PFSHxs was found in \n60% of them. The sum of these PFAS on average did not exceed 50 \nng/l in the samples, with the exception of samples from Louvain-laNeuve treatment plant. \n\n(Frippiat et al., \n2018) \n\nNorway, 2017\u20132018 Organic pollutants including 22 PFAS were analysed in sludge \nsamples from 18 treatment plants. PFAS were detected in all \nsamples, the average value 40 \u03bcg/kg TS, while the mean was 25.2 \n\u03bcg/kg TS. Treatment plants receiving wastewater from airports had \nhigher values of PFAS than others. \n\n(Blytt and Stang, \n2018) \n\nSweden, 2012\u20132015 Samples from three treatment plants were analysed for PFAS and \nprecursor compounds. 41 PFAS compounds analysed: The \u03a3PFAS \nconcentrations were in the range 29.8\u201377.0 ng/l in the effluent \nwater. Precursor compounds made a significant contribution to the \ntotal amount of PFAS. \n\n(Eriksson et al., \nn.d.) \n\nSweden, 2018\u20132019 The presence of PFAS and their potential degradation/reduction in \nsludge in different treatments was studied. Decreasing trends for \nconcentrations could be observed in composted sludge over the \nstorage time while the non-composted showed variable time trends \nfor different substance classes. For PFAS, the sum concentrations of \ntarget analytes increased by almost an order of magnitude during 12 \nmonths of storage in the non-composted sludge. Furthermore, the \nresults from Total Oxidizable Precursors (TOP) and EOF analyses \nfurthermore suggested that the sludge from both treatment \nexperiments contained a significant fraction PFAS that could not be \nquantified by the targeted analysis. \n\n(Giovanoulis et al., \n2020) \n\nGermany, 2008\u20132013 4 981 sludge samples from 1 165 different treatment plants were \nanalysed between 2008 and 2013 for 11 PFAA compounds. \nContamination of analysed PFAAs in sewage sludge clearly \ndecreased due to phase out of long chain PFAAs, but the decrease of \ntotal flux of PFAS was not verified. Very high PFAA concentrations in \nsewage sludge were detected related to firefighting foams \ncontaining PFAAs or emissions from industries using PFAAs. \n\n(Ulrich et al., 2016) \n\n \n\n \n28 nanogram (10\u22129 grams) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 54 \n\nSewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants may be applied to agricultural fields, incinerated, or \nsent to landfills for disposal (Stoiber et al., 2020). In the majority of European countries, sludge is used as \na fertiliser on soil, indeed in some Member States more than 80% of urban wastewater treatment plant \nsludge ends up on the land. Currently there are no EU criteria for organic contaminants in fertilisers or in \nsoil, and hence no limit values for PFAS or legal obligation to monitor for them in urban wastewater \ntreatment plant sludge. EU Member States may have set their own criteria, in Denmark, for instance the \namount of 12 PFAS in soil is limited to 400 \u00b5g/kg dry matter soil (DK EPA, 2015). In Europe and the United \nStates urban wastewater treatment plant sludge has caused contamination of soil, water and crops. In \nEurope this has been documented in the EU research project PERFOOD (2008\u20132012) (29), and in later \nresearch and national publications from, amongst others the Netherlands and Sweden. The EU also funded \nthe NonHazCities (30) regional study on PFAS emissions from cities to the Baltic Sea which demonstrated \nthat these chemicals are released from households to urban wastewater treatment plants. \n\nOnce PFAS containing sludge is applied on soil, these compounds may bioaccumulate in plants. The plant \nuptake depends on various factors, but particularly shorter chain PFAS seem to accumulate in leaves and \nfruit, whereas higher chain PFAS tend to be more concentrated in roots (Costello and Lee, 2020; Ghisi et \nal., 2019). Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and PFPeA have been detected in lettuce and tomatoes grown in \nsoil to which biosolids had been applied (Blaine et al., 2013). It is difficult to treat wastewater sludge and \nremove PFAS due to its complex nature. Information on treatment of PFAS contaminated soils is scarce, \nwhereas numerous reviews on PFAS removal from aqueous environments are available. Currently \navailable methods for remediation of PFAS contaminated soils seem to be expensive, impractical for in situ \ntreatment, use high pressure and temperatures, and/or result in toxic waste (Shahsavari et al., 2021). A \nvariety of remediation technologies have been introduced at a laboratory scale such as chemical oxidation, \nball milling, and electron beams, however, additional research is needed to make them feasible, costeffective and applicable in the field. \n\n6.3.2 Industrial wastewater treatment plants \n\nDetection of volatile PFAS in air above industrial effluent wastewaters show that they are emitted in the \nproduction/manufacturing processes (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). This is also confirmed, for example, by the \nFood Contact Substance Notifications which reported that United States Food and Drug Administration \nhas approved fluorinated acrylic polymers for use in coating food-contact paper and board (EDF, 2018) \nand noted that 88% was retained on the paper with 4% going to wastewater and 8% to sludge. Compared \nto their urban equivalents, industrial wastewater treatment plants typically have more developed \ntreatments for the removal chemicals from water, with the sludge going for incineration or landfilling. \nThere are, however, several instances in both Europe and the United States of widespread pollution from \ntreatment plants, the most well known of which concern fluoropolymer facilities in the United States such \nas DuPont (now Chemours) and 3M manufacturing sites. Here PFOA used as a dispersion agent (polymer \nproduction aid) in PTFE was emitted to lakes, rivers, soil and groundwater through wastewater treatment \nplants, landfills and emissions to the air. The contamination led to widespread pollution of the surrounding \ncommunities and livestock as well as the wider environment resulting in court cases that were settled by \npayments totalling more than US$ 700 million. Both in the United States and Europe sludge mixed into \nbiosolids as soil improvers have been spread on farmland and has thereby contaminated the environment, \ncrops, drinking water, people and livestock. The best-documented case concerned the German district of \nRastatt where papermill sludge contaminated with PFAS was mixed into a soil improver \u2013 the exact type \nof chemical and whether a polymeric or non-polymeric PFAS was used remains uncertain. Contamination \nfrom a paper factory was also recently discovery in Tyrifjord, Norway (Langberg et al., 2021). In both cases \nthe presence of PFOS indicates that non-polymeric surfactants might have been used, but the exact PFAS \ntype and its source remains unknown. \n\n \n29 PERFOOD: https://ibed.fnwi.uva.nl/perfood/index.html \n30 NonHazCity: https://thinkbefore.eu/en/ \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 55 \n\nIn summary, studies are scarce on both the fraction of PFAS from fluorinated polymers that are released \nto air, water and sludge and the extent to which they have and are contaminating soil, water and crops \nthrough the application of urban wastewater treatment plant sludge. \n\nThe EU Chemical Strategy for Sustainability and its European Commission\u2019s supporting PFAS Staff Working \nDocument call for the inclusion of PFAS in the recast of the Fertiliser Directive. This may provide an option \nto determine the amounts of both specific and total PFAS in wastewater treatment plant sludge from both \nurban and industrial sources. The recommended inclusion of these chemicals in the revision of the \nEuropean Pollutant Release and Transfer Register may also provide more information and better control \nof PFAS emitted from industrial and urban wastewater treatment plants. Given the diversity of these \nchemicals, effective control may require limit values and monitoring of all PFAS as well as specific ones. \nThe comprehensive screening of PFAS is challenging due to the large number of different PFAS. One \nmethod proposed to investigate unknown PFAS is to measure the total EOF in addition to targeted PFAS \nin a sample (K\u00e4rrman et al., 2019). \n\n6.4 Landfilling of wastes from fluorinated polymer production and end-of-life products \n\n6.4.1 Management of waste from fluorinated polymer production and products \n\nIn the production of fluorinated polymers, wastes containing PFAS are generated but very little \ninformation is available in scientific literature about their management. A Dutch study (Gebbink and van \nLeeuwen, 2020) mentions that at the Chemour plant in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, 50% of GenX ends up \nin the waste streams and is sent to a nearby incineration plant. In Europe, waste containing PFAS are \nclassified as hazardous if their PFAS content exceeds a substance specific limit value (Box 6.1). According \nto Council Decision 2003/33/EC, hazardous wastes may only be disposed of at hazardous waste landfills if \nthe waste acceptance criteria are met; for example, low organic content measured as loss of ignition not \nexceeding 10% at 550 oC. Since the landfill legislation came into force, organic hazardous process residues \nare incinerated rather than disposed of in landfills. \n\nIn the past, wastes from organofluorine industries were disposed of in landfills resulting in associated \nreleases (Oliaei et al. 2013). These old landfill sites need particular assessment. In Switzerland, for example, \nlandfills in which the pharmaceutical and pesticide industries disposed of their waste for decades have \nbeen excavated and, according to an internet source (31), the materials removed sent for further treatment \nand destruction. \n\n6.4.2 Emissions of PFAS from the landfilling of end-of-life products \n\nSince 2016, most European countries have introduced restrictions on landfilling waste which have \ngenerally been implemented in Member States as bans on landfilling specific waste streams such as plastic, \ntextiles and carpet wastes, and these wastes are increasingly incinerated. Furthermore, the revised Waste \nFramework Directive has set a target for reducing the amount of municipal waste sent to landfills of 10% \nof total waste by 2035. According to Eurostat data, in the member and cooperating countries of the \nEuropean Environment Agency in 2006, 44% of municipal waste was disposed of in landfills, but by 2017 \nthis had fallen to 23%. Nonetheless, in 18 of the 38 countries, corresponding to 33% of the European \npopulation, landfill rates were more than 50% in 2017 (Figure 6.1). \n\n \n31 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfol; accessed May 28, 2021 \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfol\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 56 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Landfill rates in member and cooperating countries of the European Environment Agency, 2006 and 2017, \n%. \n\nSource: EEA (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/municipal-waste-landfill-rates-in#tab-chart_1) \n\nIn landfill conditions, waste containing PFAS will decompose and release them (Lang et al., 2017; 2016a). \nMany of these substances occur in soluble form; anionic PFOA, for example, is highly soluble, and are \ntherefore likely to be released into the percolating water in the landfill as leachate. As discussed in Chapter \n4, neutral, volatile PFAS, such as FTOH, can be released by sidechain fluorinated polymers as breakdown \nproducts. As only a few articles on release behaviour of PFAS from specific waste types in landfill conditions \nare available, there is still lack of information on the release mechanism and factors influencing their \nbehaviour and potential transformation in landfill conditions. One study showed that in an anaerobic \nlandfill reactor a contact time of more than 100 days was needed before PFAS are released in measurable \nconcentrations from carpet and clothing (Lang et al., 2016b). The results indicate that carpet and clothing \nare likely sources of PFAS in landfill leachate in the United States (Knutsen et al., 2019; Lang et al. 2017; \n2016). \n\nLeachates and sediments from a Norwegian landfill were analysed for PFAS (Eggen et al., 2010). Results \nindicated a potential for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to facilitate transport of fluorinated compounds. \nPFCA substances up to perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDcA) have been detected in the water phase, while \nPFDcA, perfluoroundecanic (PFUnA), perfluorododecanic (PFDoA) and perfluorotridecanic acids (PFTrA) \nwhere detected in sludge; this has also been reported elsewhere including in a Danish study by Bossi et al. \n(2008). Leachate, particularly from organic waste at municipal landfills, contains high concentrations of \nDOC due to the degradation of organic matter. \n\nIn the Norwegian study (Eggen et al., 2010), particular concern was raised about the high concentrations \nof PFAS, up to 6 231 ng/l, in the leachate from landfills. Furthermore, several PFAS, such as long-chained \nPFCAs not detected in either water or particle phases in leachates, were in some cases found in relatively \nhigh concentrations in sediments taken from treatment systems of landfill leachates. A potential \nexplanation is that they were formed during the transformation of perfluorinated precursors. Precursors \nare compounds, both known and unknown, which have the potential to form perfluorinated compounds \n(PFCAs and PFSAs) (Houtz and Sedlak, 2012) at degradation. \n\nIn an Australian study (Gallen et al., 2017), some general trends in leachate characteristics were observed: \nhigher concentrations were found in operating landfills for municipal waste compared to closed ones. \nLandfills that also accepted construction and demolition waste generated higher concentrations of PFHxA \nand PFHpA than purely municipal waste landfills. Both PFHxA and PFHpA are minor impurities in \ncommercial PFOS and PFOA formulations, and potentially precursor chemicals released in landfill \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/municipal-waste-landfill-rates-in#tab-chart_1\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 57 \n\nconditions or PFOA alternatives. Also elevated DOC content and increased acidity in leachate were linked \nto higher leachate concentrations. \n\nThe released PFAS are transported in water to the bottom of the landfill from where leachates are \ncollected and typically sent to wastewater treatment plants prior to their discharge into surface water \nbodies. Part of the leachate may however escape to groundwater without undergoing treatment, \nespecially from old, unlined landfills. Articles on leachate composition from landfills still in operation are \navailable in the literature, although PFAS compounds are also released from closed landfills, even if the \namount of leachate is reduced. \n\nThe discharge of PFAS to the environment can be roughly estimated based on total leachate volumes and \naverage concentration in the leachate. Table 6.3 summarises PFAS discharges reported in some recent \nstudies, with further calculations showing discharges per person and per year. Contrary to expectation, \nthe release reported from landfills in Spain, which has a high landfill rate, was significantly lower than in \nNorway and Sweden. The specific substances and the number of substances measured should, however, \nbe taken into account in the comparison of the data \u2013 the sum results from German study, for example, \ncannot be directly compared to results from other countries. Furthermore, there might be differences in \nanalytical procedures \u2013 for example, threshold values for analysis or filtration of samples prior to analysis \nthat might reduce the concentration. Furthermore, PFAS precursors and their degradation products should \nbe included in the analytical programme in order to avoid their underestimation and comparisons ideally \nmade on substance basis. According to a Norwegian study (Knutsen et al., 2019), 3.5% of PFOA is estimated \nto be released from municipal landfills. \n\nA total yearly release of PFAS from municipal landfills in Europe can be roughly calculated assuming that \nall countries\u2019 annual releases per person are of the same magnitude as Spain, which has higher landfill \nrates than most European countries. This would suggest total annual releases of 430 kg of PFAS from \nmunicipal landfills in 37 European countries (calculated based on population in the countries included in \nFig. 6.132). If, however, all countries have releases similar to Sweden\u2019s, then Europe\u2019s total annual releases \nfrom landfills would increase significantly to 3.7 tonnes. \n\nIt needs to be stressed that this does not include releases from landfills in which the organofluorine \nindustry (Oliaei et al., 2013) or such users of PFAS as the plating or paper industries dispose of their waste. \nThe release from such landfills are likely higher (Oliaei et al., 2013). \n\nTable 6.3 Discharge to the environment of PFAS by landfill leachate reported in some studies. \n\nNote: the table also includes information on landfill rates per country \n\nCountry  \n(source) \n\nLandfill rate \n(year) \n\nEstimated \ndischarge per \n\nyear \n\nCalculated \nannual \n\ndischarge per \nperson (mg) \n\nComment \n\nGermany  \n(Busch et al., \n2010) \n\n< 1 % \n(2006, 2017) \n\nAround 90 \nkg/year for 55 \nPFAS (calculated \namount in treated \nleachate from \nabout 1 700 \nlandfills) \n\n \n\n1 000 \n\nSamples of treated and untreated leachate from \n22 landfill sites in Germany were analysed for 43 \nPFAS.

(2019); Busch et al. (2010) \n\nThe need for further information on emissions of semi-volatile PFAS compounds from landfills has been \nbrought up in Canada (Hamid et al., 2018). In Europe, municipal landfills are generally covered by sealing \nlayers after closure and therefore emissions to air from these semi-volatile PFAS compounds are assumed \nnot to be significant in closed European landfills. \n\nLandfill sites, at least in those studied in Ireland (Harrad et al., 2020), had similar atmospheric \nconcentrations of PFOA and related compounds both up- and downwind suggesting these landfill sites are \nnot a significant source of these compounds to the atmosphere. This corroborates information obtained \nin Germany where only the volatile non-ionic per- and polyfluorinated compounds were found to be \nenriched in the atmosphere near landfills (Weinberg et al., 2011). General German domestic waste \ncontains 0.01\u20130.035% fluorine (Aleksandrov et al., 2019). In samples collected at Chinese landfill sites, \nhowever, Wang et al. (2020) were able to detect concentrations of ionic per- and polyfluorinated \ncompounds in the picogram (33) per cubic metre range. \n\nIn their study of emissions from landfill sites in Germany (Weinberg et al., 2019), a wide range of volatile \nand semi-volatile compounds were detected at the sites and also at lower concentrations at the reference \nsites. The enhancement above ambient concentrations was between 1.5 and 3 times. The greatest \nenrichment at the landfill sites was derived from the fluorotelomer alcohols. \n\n \n33 Picogram: 1 trillionth of a gram (10-12) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 60 \n\n Recent laboratory studies (Hamid et al., 2020) have shown the potential for fluorotelomer alcohols and \nsulfonates to produce PFOA and other carboxylic acids in landfill aqueous leachates albeit with a long halflife of greater than a year. It is possible that this slow process may be responsible for some future emissions \nfrom landfills, although the long half-life coupled with the low incidence of the precursors in landfill waste \nmake these emissions hard to detect in ambient air. \n\n6.5 Emissions of PFAS to air from the incineration of fluorinated polymers \n\nThe Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) requires that waste incineration plants must be designed \nto ensure the flue gases reach a temperature of at least 850 \u00b0C for 2 seconds to ensure the complete \nbreakdown of toxic organic substances. If hazardous waste with a content of more than 1% of halogenated \norganic substances (34) is incinerated or co-incinerated, the temperature should be at least 1 100 \u00b0C with \na minimum residence time of 2 seconds in order to mineralise all organic compounds. Lemieux et al., \n(2000), however, showed that peak temperatures in backyard open burning systems reached only 250\u2013\n620 \u00b0C. \n\nThis the following section on incineration therefore describes the thermal degradation at temperature \nranges of 250\u20131400 \u00b0C. \n\n6.5.1 Thermal degradation of fluorinated polymers, demonstrated theoretically or in \nlaboratories \n\nAs with pyrolysis, incineration or combustion is the decomposition of chemicals at high temperatures. The \ndifference lies in the presence of oxygen that is part of the reaction in incineration but not in pyrolysis. \nDepending on the temperature, incineration can result in very different end products. Ellis et al. (2001) \ndifferentiate incineration from thermolysis because of the presence of a fuel source in incineration that \nensures complete combustion of the material being incinerated. Thermolysis, with no fuel source, can run \nat lower temperatures, but enables the emission of different fluorocarbons in the process. It must be \nnoted, however, that the definition of the term thermolysis in Ellis et al. (2001) is not definitive; other \nsources define it as thermal decomposition without the presence of any oxygen, even less than in pyrolysis \n( 35 ,36 ) For the purpose of this report, incineration means thermal decomposition of chemicals in the \npresence of oxygen, irrespective of the temperature range. \n\nThe thermal decomposition of wastes is a multistage process and may additionally use a post-combustion \nfuel to raise the flue gas temperature above critical thresholds to ensure complete degradation of \nrecalcitrant compounds including halogenated materials. The flue gas is likely to be washed and filtered \nbefore release to the environment. The 2017 European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register lists 171 \nfacilities that annually discharged more than 5.0 tonnes the reporting threshold of inorganic fluorine \ncompounds as HF. The top 10 discharge facilities are a mixture of aluminium smelters, thermal power \nstations and ceramics producers. There are no waste and wastewater management facilities that report \nHF discharges. \n\nStudies on the behaviour of PTFE during thermal degradation showed that the process involved random \nchain cleavage, depolymerisation and disproportionation (Garcia et al., 2007). Slow decomposition occurs \nat 260 \u00b0C (Simon and Kaminsky, 1998) although there is a notable threshold at 400 \u00b0C above which the rate \nincreases significantly. Decomposition is essentially complete by 650 \u00b0C. At 800 \u00b0C, the half-life of PTFE is \n0.1 seconds and so 1 second at this temperature is equivalent to 10 half-lives. Yamada et al., (2005), for \nexample, showed that there were no detectable emissions of PFOA during the combustion of fabrics or \npaper treated with fluorotelomer-based acrylic polymers in municipal incinerators as the temperature \nwere likely to have been high enough to ensure complete conversion to HF.

(2001) summarised the combustion of PTFE after conducting experiments in an oven up to \n500 \u00b0C. They also identified difluorocarbene molecules as part of the major thermal degradation pathway \nleading to the formation of TFE. This may also lead to the formation of cyclo-octafluorobutane (c-OFB, cC4F8), a potent greenhouse gas with a GWP of 9 540, and, in the presence of oxygen, epoxides, ethers and \ncarboxylic acids including TFA. TFE, c-OFB, HFP, CF3(CF2)1-12COOH (PFCA), CF3O(CF2)1-7COOH, TFA, \nmonofluoroethane (MFA) and difluoroethane (DCM) were all experimentally identified by Ellis et al. (2001) \nin the thermal decomposition of PTFE at 500 \u00b0C and 360 \u00b0C. \n\nThe process, as proposed by Ellis et al. (2001), is shown, simplified, in Figure 6.3. In this scheme, TFA is one \nof the final products. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 62 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2. The proposed thermal degradation pathway summarises many of the pathways and products proposed \nby Garcia et al. (2007), Koch (2002) and Simon and Kaminsky (1998). The primary route is to the right indicated by \nthe thicker arrow. When percentages are given, the species was also quantified. PFAs were not identified in \nexperiments, while TFE, HFP and c-OFB were the major gases produced. \n\nSource: modified from Ellis et al. (2001) \n\nWith respect to the formation of ODS, during incineration of general household waste containing \nfluorinated polymers or the incineration of fluorinated polymers on their own, the ubiquitous presence of \nchlorine can cause their formation. \n\nAny fluorinated compound containing the C-CF3 group may degrade to TFA under certain circumstances \nand TFA can be a significant stable product in the mineralisation of certain fluorinated polymers such as \n1,1,1-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a, CF3CH2F), 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124, CF3CHFCl) \nand 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HCFC-123, CF3CHCl2) \u2013 note: all have the C-CF3 group. \n\nTFA is water soluble and readily washed out of the atmosphere by rain into the sea, rivers, lakes and \nground water. Due to its characteristics as a very strong acid, it is likely to exist in its ionic-free formiate \nform (CF3COO-). An additional source that causes natural enrichment in seawater was long suggested to \nbe TFA formation near hydrothermal systems with an estimated 6 000 kg annual input (Scott et al., 2005). \nIt must be noted, however, that most of the TFA in surface waters likely comes from anthropogenic \nsources. Further, Joudan et al., (2021) suggest that there is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that \nTFA occurs naturally at all and that there exists no reasonable mechanism of natural formation of TFA. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 63 \n\nBox 6.2 Sources of TFA \n\nOne major anthropogenic source of TFA is the degradation of HCFCs, HFCs, HFOs and HCFOs that are \nmainly used as refrigerants and foam-blowing agents. The most relevant substances in this context are \n1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 2,3,3,3-terafluoropropylene (HFO-1234yf). While other gases, \nsuch as HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 are practically entirely converted to TFA during atmospheric degradation \n(Kotamarthi et al., 1998), they are much less used and consequently emitted than many HFCs and HFOs. \nHFC-134a was until recently the major refrigerant in air-conditioning systems of passenger cars and light \ncommercial vehicles. Following MAC-Directive (2006/40/EC), the gas contained in such systems may not \nexceed a GWP of 150. This applies to the use in all new vehicles in the EU, starting from 2017. Since HFC134a has a global warming potential of 1 300, it has been replaced by the unsaturated low GWP gas HFO1234yf. While HFC-134a has a molar yield of TFA in the course of its atmospheric degradation of around \n7\u201320% (Wallington et al., 1996), HFO-1234yf degrades entirely to TFA (Hurley et al., 2008). Other HFCs and \nHFOs show a varying degree of TFA-yield, ranging from zero to 100%, depending on the intermediate \ndegradation products. While trifluoroacetyl fluoride (CF3CFO) is converted entirely to TFA, \ntrifluoroacetaldehyde (CF3CHO) is estimated to yield TFA of up to 10% on a molar basis (WMO, 2010). \n\nFor halogenated propylenes, the intermediate is determined by the atom that is bound to the central \ncarbon (WMO, 2014). If fluorine is bound to it, then CF3CFO and consequently TFA are the degradation \nproducts. This applies to HFO-1234yf. On the other hand, if hydrogen is bound to the central carbon, then \nCF3CHO is the intermediate product and the TFA yield will be much smaller. This applies to 1,1,1-3tetrafluoropropylene (HFO-1234ze) and 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (HCFC-1233zd), both gases that \nare marketed by industry as replacements of HFCs as refrigerants and foam-blowing agents. \n\nModelling studies of future deposition rates of TFA mostly focused on HFO-1234yf as it is a key precursor \ngas of TFA and limited their studies to its emissions from mobile air-conditioning systems in passenger \ncars. Across the United States, assuming all passenger cars in 2017 were equipped with HFO-1234yf \u2013 \nwhich is not the case since many older cars with HFC-134a are still in use but to gauge the effect once this \nconversion is completed \u2013 a fallout of 0.24 kg/km\u00b2 of TFA was modelled (Luecken et al., 2010). For Europe, \nHenne et al., (2012) also assumed a complete conversion from HFC-134a to HFO-1234yf in passenger cars \nin 2020 \u2013 which is also not the case but, again, intended to assess the future effect \u2013 and estimated an \naverage TFA deposition rate of 0.65\u20130.76 kg/km\u00b2 per year. Maxima of up to 2 kg/km\u00b2 per year were \nestimated for northern Italy. \n\nOther major sources for TFA include the metabolic and environmental degradation of pesticides and \npharmaceuticals carrying CF3-groups, more than 1 million chemicals, mostly found in sludge and rural \neffluents. The total contribution to existing amounts of TFA in the ocean as a result of the continued use \nof HCFCs, HFCs and HFOs up to 2050 is estimated to be a small fraction, <7.5% of the approximately 0.2 \n\u03bcg acid equivalents/L estimated to be present at the start of the millennium, indicating the presence of \nmajor additional sources (Solomon et al., 2016). The replacement of perfluorinated compounds with \npolyfluorinated ethers may, for example, induce enhanced UV degradability although with significant -CF3 \nproduction (Bentel et al., 2020). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3. Structure of TFA. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 64 \n\ncont. \n\nFreeling et al. (2020) carried out a nationwide measuring programme of trifluoroacetate in precipitation \nin Germany. They concluded that in February 2018\u2013January 2019, the precipitation-weighted average \nconcentration of trifluoroacetate in wet deposition was 0.335 \u00b5g/l, which corresponds to an annual flux \nof 190 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 or around 68 tonnes (Freeling et al., 2020). Given the exceptionally dry conditions in 2018, \nthe wet deposition flux would amount to around 98 tonnes based on the average precipitation for 1981\u2013\n2010. This exceeds previously measured trifluoroacetate concentrations in Bayreuth, Germany in 1995\u2013\n1996 (Jordan and Frank, 1999) and Switzerland in 1996\u20131997 (Berg et al., 2000) by a factor of three to \nfive. Given the strong seasonality of the annual trifluoroacetate concentration and flux measured by \nFreelin g et al. (2020), precursors of TFA and trifluoroacetate are likely volatile compounds, such as HFCs \nand HFOs. \n\n \n\nSeveral studies on the ecotoxicity of TFA in water media, as well as some risk assessment studies of TFA \nhave been conducted. Box 6.2 summarises that TFA readily dissociates upon contact with water and builds \nhighly stable and unreactive salts (Solomon et al., 2016). Tests on different species found a generally low \ntoxicity of TFA salts, with the most sensitive species being the freshwater microalgae Raphidocelis \nsubcapitata (formerly Selenastrum capricornutum and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Adverse growth \neffects were detected at concentrations above 0.12 mg/L (Boutonnet et al., 1999). A new study performed \nby INERIS in 2017, however, found a no-effect concentration (NOEC) of 2.5 mg/L, which subsequently led \nto the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 0.56 mg/L TFA in freshwater according to ECHA (2020). \n\nDue to its complete water miscibility, TFA does not bioaccumulate or biomagnify up the food chain. \n\n6.5.2 Municipal incineration of fluorinated polymers and other perfluoroalkyl chemicals wastes \n\nMunicipal waste containing fluorinated polymers, such as end-of-life consumer products, is often \nincinerated in Europe (Table 6.4). Only limited amounts of fluorinated polymer waste can be incinerated \nin municipal waste incinerators due to the high corrosiveness of the hydrofluoric acid formed in \nincineration (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). There is, however, a lack of data concerning actual emissions of a \nvariety of volatile PFAS from municipal incinerators. Studies would be highly useful to get data, both when \nthe incinerators are operated at low-temperatures, such as during start-up or if energy consuming \nmaterials are added, and at optimal high-temperature conditions. \n\nAleksandrov et al. (2019) found that German municipal waste contained 0.01\u20130.035% fluorine. If, \nhowever, it is assumed that a fluorine content of 0.01% is a conservative estimate and that it is all PTFE, \nestimates of PFAS emissions are challenged by concerns on the usability of the data from this study (37). \nFurther, alternative, more volatile PFAS formation, as shown in Figure 6.2, is not taken into account. \n\nA review on PFAS emissions from waste incinerators has been published by RIVM (Bakker et al 2021). There \nis a lack of measurement data of PFAS in the recovered carbon dioxide and in cleaned flue gases. \nMeasurements of PFAS in these streams are recommended in the review for better understanding of the \nrisks of transmission of PFAS from incinerators.  \n\nThe household waste produced by European countries is shown in Table 6.5, with the countries ranked by \nthe volume of waste produced per person. The Scandinavian countries, with the exception of Iceland, \nshow the highest incineration/energy recovery rates at 48\u201353%. \n\n \n\n \n37 In the study by Aleksandrov et al., (2019) the level of PFOA in the blanks exceeded the levels of PFOA in the samples, which \n\nwere apparently not corrected for the background levels. This questions the reliability of the conclusions of the Aleksandrov et \nal. (2019) study. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 65 \n\nTable 6.5.

This may include devices and tubing along with \ncontainers for drugs and solutions. All medical waste is considered hazardous and in Europe is disposed of \nthrough licensed high temperature incinerators in which the temperature should ensure the complete \nmineralisation of the polymers to HF. \n\nThe overall picture on the incineration of waste containing fluorinated polymers is as follows. \n- There is a high risk that fluorinated polymers degrade to both highly volatile and ionic/water \n\nsoluble PFAS if the combustion temperature is not high enough to ensure the complete \nmineralisation of fluoropolymers to HF. Also, if degradation is incomplete, highly persistent TFA \nand HCFs with high GWPs may be formed. \n\n- The levels of volatiles formed in incineration depends on combustion/flue gas temperature, \noxygen and residence time. \n\n- It is likely that some fluorinated polymer containing wastes are sent to municipal waste \nincineration plants. However, there is lack of reliable information on amounts PFAS actually \nemitted in flue gases from municipal waste incineration plants. \n\n- No information is available on incineration conditions of waste treated outside EU \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 66 \n\n6.5.3 Kiln incineration of fluorinated polymers and other PFAS wastes \n\nThe Yamada and Taylor (2003) study was one of the first to assess the temperatures required for PFOS \ndestruction at more than 900 \u00baC. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) POPs guide on PFOS \nis a reference for destruction at 1100 \u00baC based on the work on PFOS in isolation cited by the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (US EPA). \n\nWang et al. (2015a) demonstrated that PFOS destruction catalysed by calcium could be at much lower \ntemperatures, possibly due to the calcium stripping of the fluorine shifting the reaction equilibrium. \n\nCement kilns are fairly criticised globally for their fossil fuel use, emissions of CO2 and nitrogen oxides \n(NOx), and the possible formation of chlorinated and brominated compounds (Karstensen, 2012). While \nfluorine is also a halogen, it behaves entirely differently simply due to the stripping effect of the high \nproportions of calcium and the permanent capture as calcium fluorine (Ca-F). (Patterson and Dastgheib, \n2020, Wang et al 2015a) \n\nOverall, cement kilns are seeking to improve their energy use and emissions, will be in operation for at \nleast some decades longer than society will need to dispose of PFAS waste, and represent the best \navailable technology for its destruction given: \n\n- very large safety margins of temperature and residence times in the normal cement clinker \nproduction process; \n\n- catalyses PFAS destruction at lower temperatures in all parts of the process; \n- fluorine stripping and permanent capture as inert CaF2. \n- no additional energy expenditure above normal operating conditions and possible energy savings; \n- no special modification of the kiln operation needed as fuel is introduced mixed into waste oil; \n- no effect on the quality of cement \u2013 fluorine has long been used to improve cement hardness. \n\nThere are some organisations that are philosophically strongly opposed to cement kilns but on a netbenefit analysis they cannot justify the alternative that has a much higher risk of PFAS emissions, large \nenergy expenditure of hazmat incineration and the cost of neutralising and disposing of the fluoride waste \nproduced. \n\nIn conclusion there may be new techniques that can increase the removal of PFAS from incineration \nexhaust, which would be beneficial to investigate further also in Europe. \n\n6.5.4 Uncontrolled burning of wastes \n\nSome electronic and electrical components such as wire is insulated with PTFE and PVDF. In less developed \ncountries4, the recovery of the copper from this wire, using low-technology methods such as burning, may \nrelease PFAS into the atmosphere (Figure 6.4). \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 67 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4. Low temperature combustion of polymers associated with wire and printed circuit boards along with other \ne-waste at Agbogbloshie, Ghana, 2018. \n\nPhoto: S.Mudge \n\nStudies conducted on backyard burning systems by Lemieux et al. (2000) only observed temperatures in \nexcess of 500 \u00b0C on one occasion, suggesting that temperatures will usually be lower. Additionally, there \nis no information on the emission rates of any fluorinated compounds in their study. Oxygen may be a \nlimiting factor in such systems as well and there may be a wider range of compounds formed than \nindicated in a study by Aleksandrov et al. (2019). In the absence of further information, this probably \nrepresents a conservative estimate of the PFOA and of other volatile PFAS emissions in low temperature \ncombustion conditions, as shown in Figure 6.2. \n\n6.6 Knowledge gaps \n\nFollowing knowledge gaps have been identified: \n\n\u2022 lack of information on actual handling and management of fluorinated polymer-containing \nproducts used in many applications, such as in vehicles and electronics, in the production of \nchemicals and use in renewable energy applications; \n\n\u2022 detection limits used in the literature for analysis of emissions; \n\n\u2022 number of substances included varies in studies; \n\n\u2022 standardisation of monitoring of emissions \u2013 sampling and analytics; \n\n\u2022 no data available on the current recycling rates of products; \n\n\u2022 lack of information on release mechanisms of PFAS from landfills, degradation/transformation in \nlandfill conditions and the fate of leachates; \n\n\u2022 lack of information on cost efficient wastewater treatment systems for landfill leachate; \n\n\u2022 assessment of past and present sludge/waste management and the disposal practices of users of \nfluorinated polymers, such as paper factories, carpet factories or factories producing Tefloncoated kitchenware, bearing the large-scale contamination in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany in \nmind (Goldenman et al., 2019); \n\n\u2022 situation of landfills where the organofluorine and fluorinated polymer industries have disposed \nof their waste over the last 50 years; \n\n\u2022 situation of landfills where users of fluorinated polymers, such as paper factories, carpet factories \nor factories producing Teflon-coated kitchenware, have disposed of their production wastes; \n\n\u2022 potential export beyond Europe of end-of-life products containing critical raw materials outside \nfor metal recovery. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 68 \n\n7 Overall impacts along the lifecycles \n\nMain authors: Margareta Wahlstr\u00f6m and Xenia Trier \nContributors: Dorte Herzke, Barbara Gschrey and Peder Gabrielsen \n\nKey messages: \n\n\u2022 Potential impacts along the lifecycle of fluorinated polymers that support or conflict with the goals \nof EU strategies were identified. \n\n\u2022 Circular economy: \n\u25aa support: durable, longevity, miniaturisation of products generating less waste; \n\u25aa conflict: fluorspar on list of critical raw materials, no information on recycling, \n\nminimal recycling identified. \n\n\u2022 Low carbon economy: \n\u25aa support: use in renewable energy applications, reduced energy need \u2013 lighter \n\nvehicles, etc.; \n\u25aa conflict: feedstocks with the potential to emit GHG used in production. \n\n\u2022 Zero Pollution Ambition/toxic-free environment \n\u25aa support: longevity; \n\u25aa conflict: use of toxic feedstocks potentially emitted in production, use and end of \n\nlife. \n\n\u2022 Other considerations may include benefits to human health such as high performing medical \nutensils and diagnostic instruments, protective clothing for occupational use, or use of \nprotective textiles to minimise risks for medical staff and patients from exposure of infectious \nagents in medical treatment. \n\n7.1  Approach \n\nIn this chapter impacts are analysed in the light of EU policies, which were introduced with the European \nGreen Deal in 2019 by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. As a consequence of the \nEuropean Green Deal, a number of strategies and action plans to reduce human and environmental health \ndegradation have been launched, including on the CE, resource efficiency and raw materials, the lowcarbon economy and the Zero Pollution Ambition for a toxic free environment. \n\n\u2022 The CE aims to foster an economy that retains as much of the value of materials as possible, for as \nlong as possible (EEA, 2016). To achieve a transition to a CE, action needs to address all products\u2019 \nlifecycle stages, and therefore needs to go beyond waste management and improved recycling. \nAlso the growing waste generation from renewable energy sets need to implement CE principles \nby applying circular business models to maintain producer responsibility and facilitating reuse and \nmaterial recovery from renewable energy applications after use .(EEA, 2021) \n\n\u2022 The low-carbon economy aims to minimise emissions of GHG to the atmosphere. Focus areas \ninclude shifting from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, \nand promotion of energy efficient products and processes. \n\n\u2022 The Zero Pollution Ambition for a toxic-free environment, and the Chemicals Strategy for \nSustainability towards a toxic-free environment (CSS) (EC, 2020), both aim to avoid harm from \npollution to people and the environment. The CSS emphasises the need to prevent further \npollution by substances of concern, particularly for those that accumulate or cause effects that \naccumulate in people or the environment. Persistent chemicals such as PFAS (EC, 2020b), bioactive \nchemicals, such as endocrine disrupters, and mixtures of chemicals (EC, 2020c) are highlighted \nexamples. \n\nThe New Circular Economy Action Plan was launched in 2020 and focusses on sustainable resource use, \nespecially in resource-intensive and high impact sectors such as electronics and information and \ncommunications technology (ICT); batteries and vehicles; packaging; plastics; textiles; construction and \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 69 \n\nbuildings; food; water and nutrients. Fluorinated polymers are, with the exception of the food, packaging, \nwater and nutrients sectors, relevant to these sectors. Examples of measures mentioned are as follows: \n\n\u2022 make sustainable products, with a focus on the safety of consumers and the environment; \n\n\u2022 ensure less waste; \n\n\u2022 make circularity work for people, regions and cities; \n\n\u2022 assess potential impacts of recycling practises; \n\n\u2022 lead global efforts on the circular economy. \n\nThe New Circular Economy Action plan contains a legislative initiative proposal to widen the Eco-Design \nDirective to the broadest possible range of products rather than just energy-related ones. The new Action \nPlan announces initiatives along the entire lifecycle of products, targeting, for example, their safe and \nsustainable design, promoting CE processes, fostering sustainable consumption, and aiming to ensure that \nresources used are kept within the EU economy for as long as possible. It introduces legislative and nonlegislative measures targeting areas in which action at the EU level brings real added value. \n\nIn relation to the EU raw materials initiative, the European Commission has created a list of critical raw \nmaterials that are important to the European economy but are also associated with supply risks (European \nCommission, 2020). One of the listed materials is fluorspar, which is used as input in the production of \nfluorinated polymers. Increased recycling would be one way of reducing dependence on imports, as well \nas improving material efficiency and reducing the lifecycle environmental impacts of applications. \nCurrently, fluorspar is recycled but only to a small extent since it is transformed to other chemicals when \nused, and recycling is currently complex (British Geological Survey, 2010). \n\nThis chapter builds on findings presented in previous chapters. The outcome of the analysis is presented \nfor different stages of the fluorinated polymer lifecycle. Benefits and challenges related to the circular \neconomy and resource efficiency, climate effects and toxic-free environment are assessed qualitatively. \n\n7.2 Focus on the circular economy, resource efficiency and the EU raw material strategy \n\nFluorinated polymers can provide useful properties to products used in various sectors. According to \ninformation presented in literature (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, 2018; WOOD, 2020), fluorinated polymers can, for \ninstance, contribute to material or energy savings, while some of their uses can be considered essential \nfor society with regard to protecting human or environmental health. In this context, a use that is essential \nto society providing, for example, important health functions, is one for which the fluorinated polymer \ncannot be substituted by other materials, products or services delivering comparable performance at the \ntime of assessment. Conversely, a non-essential use, whether beneficial or not, is one that can be replaced \nwith a non-fluorinated product or service with a comparable performance. With time, innovation of \nalternatives may render previously essential uses, non-essential. Some examples of fluorinated polymer \nmaterials which have a range of non-essential to essential uses are provided in Cousins et al. (2019) while \na wider list of fluorinated polymers uses is provided in Gl\u00fcge et al. (2020). Some examples of useful \nfluorinated polymers \u2013 but not necessarily essential ones \u2013 are presented below. \n\n- Electronics: dielectric properties of fluorinated polymers have enabled the miniaturization of \ncomponents and final products, and hence to savings in raw materials. Fluorinated polymers can \nalso provide fire safety; high transmission speeds; and ease of installation and reliability of wires, \nas well as optical and data transmission cables. As an example, a report published by the United \nStates fluoropolymer industry (WOOD, 2020) states that the use of fluorinated polymers in \nelectronic applications may prolong their lifetimes by up to three times. The calculations and \nboundary conditions for this statement have not, however, been evaluated in this report. \n\n- Transport: prolonging component/product lifetimes in the automotive and aerospace industries \ndue to fluorinated polymers having high resistance against heat, cold, fire, smoke, aggressive \nfluids, fuels, humidity, vibrations and compressions. Improved functionality due to high reliability, \nengine efficiency, weight reduction and emission control, and fuel efficiency. The report published \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 70 \n\nby the United States fluoropolymer industry (WOOD, 2020) presents the following examples of \nbenefits in two applications: in cars, the use of fluorinated polymers contributed to a 48% increase \nin fuel efficiency, calculated on the average fuel use per kilometre travelled in American cars in \n1980\u20132016 (WOOD, 2020). In aerospace, a 93% corrosion reduction in cargo bays and avoided \nfriction damage in helicopters has been demonstrated for the use of a specific product (WOOD, \n2020). Again, the calculations and the boundary conditions used for these benefits have not been \nevaluated in this report. \n\n- Medical utensils: prolonging lifetimes of surgical implantable devices, the reduction in \ncomplications and failures due to clogging of medical pumps and catheters. Fluorinated polymer \ntextiles protect medical staff and patients from exposure to infectious agents. Use of fluorinated \npolymers provides improved reliability in the use of such medical appliances as X-rays, and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) equipment (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, \n2018; WOOD, 2020). \n\n- Chemical industry: reduction of corrosion and leaks, lower maintenance, safety (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, \n2018; WOOD, 2020). \n\n- Building sector: durable materials that prolong lifetimes, increase fire safety and reduce \nmaintenance needs (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, 2018; WOOD, 2020). \n\nIn Table 7.1 measures or actions for achieving CE solutions listed in the new Circular Economy Action Plan \nare analysed for different lifecycle stages based on the information gathered in Chapters 3\u20136. Circular \neconomy solutions identified in the use phase were mainly related to material and energy savings due to \nhigh functionality, safety and miniaturisation, the last of which also leads to the generation of less waste. \nFluorspar is, however, a critical raw material and the recycling rate is low due to the dispersed use of \nfluorinated polymers in applications. For many CE measures or actions no information was available. The \ncurrent practice of recycling of PTFE into microplastic (micro powder) needs detailed assessment in \nparticular since most uses are dispersive, releasing the PTFE microplastic into the indoor or wider \nenvironment. \n\nThe expected impact was categorised on the basis of expert judgement (Table 7.1). The reasoning for the \ncategorisation is explained within the table. Where there is uncertainty associated with the lack of \ninformation about supporting circular economy solutions, this is mentioned. \n\nTable 7.1.

As an \nexample, the worldwide market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow from 78 gigawatt hours \n(GWh) in 2016 to 210 GWh at a compound annual growth rate of plus 13% between 2016 and 2025, with \nthe highest growth expected in electric vehicles and industrial applications (Pillot, 2017). As the demand \nfor electric vehicles has grown rapidly in recent years and the lifespan of their batteries is roughly 10 years, \ngrowing lithium-ion battery waste streams are expected in the near future. \n\nChallenges related to the expected growth of these markets are related to several aspects along the \nlifecycle: \n\n\u2022 raw material production; \n\n\u2022 GHG emissions during the production process; \n\n\u2022 GHG emissions at the end of a product\u2019s life. \n\nIn the production phase, there are risks of emissions of GHG and ODS (Chapter 4.1). In the literature, there \nis no information on measured or calculated emissions related to different fluorinated polymer production \nprocesses. Accurate and transparent reporting of emissions from production processes is widely lacking \nand thus does not allow for the monitoring and verification of reduction targets. \n\nReporting of GHG emissions at the end of life is often neither accurate nor transparent. Furthermore, \nexports of end-of-life products for further (re-)use and/or extraction of materials to areas without \nstringent environmental policies and standards put efforts for reductions of the carbon footprint at risk. \n\n7.4 Focus on safety \n\nSafety is a term used to describe either the potential risks or the observed impacts of a stressor on human \nor environmental health. In this context the stressor may be one or multiple chemicals. In addition, there \nmay be other kinds of hazard, such as physical, microbiological and elements of biosafety, but these are \nnot described here. In general terms the size of the risk/impact is determined by the hazard, how \ndangerous it is; and the exposure, the likelihood of being exposed to the danger: Risk = Hazard x Exposure. \n\nThere are different types of risks/impacts, since chemicals have different kinds of toxicity or hazards. \nExamples of hazards are carcinogenicity; mutagenicity; reproductive and developmental toxicity; \nsensitising and neurodevelopmental effects; metabolic; cardiovascular; and endocrine disruption. \nTypically, toxicological testing will determine which types of hazards chemicals have, and at which \nconcentration level the effects will start to occur. Different species, for example, humans and animals, or \nbetween biota in an ecosystem, may experience different effects; effectively the chemicals may have \ndifferent hazards for different species. The level at which the effects start to show can also differ between \nspecies and at different life stages \u2013 a developing child, for example, tends to be more vulnerable to \nchemical stressors than fully developed adults. People and ecosystems that are exposed to additional \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 72 \n\nstressors, including heat stress, may also be less resilient in coping with the chemical stress and therefore \nlower levels may create impacts. \n\nExposure says something about how much of a chemical a person or living organism is exposed to. \nExposure is a combination of the concentration levels and how frequent the exposure to the chemical(s) \nis(are). Chemicals that are persistent will accumulate either internally in the organism (bioaccumulative) \nor externally in the environment (persistent and mobile chemicals). Either will lead to increasing exposure, \nand thereby risk. Persistency is a combination of intrinsic properties of the molecule and the capacity of \nthe system it is dispersed in to degrade it. This capacity may change depending on physical conditions such \nas temperature/climate, light, access to oxygen, surfaces that bind the chemicals, mixing of a system due, \nfor example, to wind, and on biological conditions, such as microbes and other biota which may help to \ndegrade the chemicals. \n\nPFAS appearing as impurities or additives in, or as degradation products of fluorinated polymer products \nare examples of substances that have lately created high concern. This is due to a number of \nconsiderations and the characteristics of PFAS (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020): PFAS consist of more than 5 000 \nchemicals which are or form persistent degradation products; which accumulate in people and/or the \nenvironment; some PFAS are persistent and mobile in air and water; others stick to surfaces such as soil \nand bioaccumulate in people and biota. Furthermore, the large majority of tested PFAS are somewhat \ntoxic either to humans, biota or Earth systems and are difficult to remove from contaminated materials, \nsoil and water. \n\nIdentifying hazardous materials in waste streams is of great importance so that they can be removed prior \nto recycling. The Zero Pollution Ambition for a toxic-free environment calls for the risks posed by very \npersistent chemicals to be addressed rapidly. Potential hazards and their expected impacts are mainly \nanalysed qualitatively because data are lacking on both hazards and exposure to the majority of PFAS, and \nparticularly the risks to ecosystem health. \n\nIn the production of fluorinated polymers, feedstock chemicals containing PFAS and other substances of \nconcern are used, including carcinogens. Toxic degradation products and by-products are also formed \nduring the manufacturing process. Several chemicals with both high GWP and ODP are also used, but there \nis hardly any monitoring of these substances or reporting of emission data in the literature. \n\nEmissions to water, soil, air and the wider environment of a large number of poly- and perfluorinated \nhighly volatile and water-soluble by-products have been reported at sites close to fluorinated polymer \nproduction plants. The fluorinated processing aids used also create concerns. Banned toxic chemicals, such \nas PFOA, have been replaced to ensure decreased persistency and bioaccumulation. However, the \nmodified molecular design, with higher volatility and higher KAW values, lead to higher emissions to the \natmosphere. \n\nDuring fluorinated polymer production, PFAS emissions of PFOA and PFNA substitutes to air, water and \nsoil are estimated to be about 120 t/year for Europe. The environmental degradation of fluorinated \nproduction aids, emitted during fluorinated polymer production, can lead to the formation of PFCAs and \nPFSAs, unstable intermediates, all forming a complex mixture of potentially harmful chemicals emitted to \nthe environment. Biological uptake has been shown in both flora and fauna, further endangering wildlife \nand human health through food production. Drinking water can be polluted when some of the very watersoluble alternatives to PFOA enter the soil and water systems. \n\nMoreover, occupational health and safety is important to consider due to the potentially toxic feedstocks \nand end-products, and degradation products and by-products formed during the polymer production, \nmanufacturing and use. Inhalation of pyrolysis products of PTFE has been reported to lead to serious toxic \nimpacts such as pulmonary edema and pneumonitis, and flu-like symptoms, sometimes called polymer \nfume fever (Johnson, 2018a). In animal studies, several other effects are seen such as tumors and higher \nmortality. In addition, studies have reported cases of pulmonary injury, for example in workers in the \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 73 \n\nbuilding industry exposed to waterproofing spray products containing fluorinated polymers (Scheepers et \nal., 2017; Lazor-Blanchet et al., 2004). In some cases, polymers contain a large proportion of oligomers, for \nexample, polychlorotrifluoroethylene may consist mainly of trimers (55%) and tetramers (45%) of \nchlorotrifluoroethylene (Johnson, 2018a). These are very small molecules consisting of only three and four \nrepeat-units, and thus oligomers which just qualify as polymers according to the ECHA definition (Section \n2.1). According to several animal studies, summarised by Johnson (2018a) these oligomers are taken up \non inhalation, bioaccumulate and form toxic degradation products. \n\nIn the use phase, the impacts are application specific. At the end-of-life stage there is a lack of information \nabout impacts due to the dispersive use of fluorinated polymers in a variety of applications in transport \nand energy production as well as in, for example, coatings and insulation materials in buildings. \n\nThere is a dispersed use of products containing fluorinated polymers in numerous applications but the \nexposure of consumers during use is highly application specific. Examples of exposure routes from some \napplications include: \n\n\u2022 inhalation of volatiles/aerosols emitted from products: overheating of kitchen utensils, spaying of \nimpregnating agents containing fluorinated polymers, and indoor dust; \n\n\u2022 direct human exposure from PFAS in food-contact materials leaching into food; \n\n\u2022 dermal contact through textiles and cosmetics/personal care products but this exposure route is \nconsidered minor compared to dietary exposure and inhalation of indoor dust; \n\n\u2022 emissions to the environment: intentional use of fluorinated microplastics, such as teflon used to \nlower friction in, for example, bicycles, other metal lubricants, and personal care products such as \nshaving foams (DK EPA, 2018), may contribute to emissions of non-degradable, persistent \nmicroplastics to the environment. Degradation of fluorinated polymers during use includes, for \nexample, the release of fibres containing them from textiles during washing, and these end up in \nwastewater. \n\nFurthermore, the risk of the dispersive use of micro-PTFE (micropowder), which amounted to about 10 000 \ntonnes of irradiated micropowder in 2010, also need to be assessed considering that PTFE does not \ndegrade in the environment for centuries and might accumulate. \n\nSome 8 300 tonnes of waste per year arise from consumer products containing fluorinated polymers, of \nwhich an estimated 1 280 tonnes is PTFE used in cooking and baking utensils (Chapter 4). Waste from \nconsumer products is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. \n\nWhen waste containing fluorinated polymers is incinerated there is a risk that under certain conditions \u2013 \nlow temperatures, low oxygen supply and short residence times in the burner \u2013 the polymers may degrade \nto TFA. This is a breakdown product of several HCFCs, regulated under the Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, as well as several saturated and unsaturated HFCs, which are \nregulated under the EU F-gas Regulation 517/2014 and, in the case of saturated HFCs, addressed by the \nKigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol at an international level. Trifluoroacetic acid is water soluble \nand is readily washed out of the atmosphere by rain and enters the sea, rivers, lakes and groundwater, but \ngenerally it has low toxicity for aquatic organisms. No estimates of the emissions of TFA, particularly from \nthe incineration of waste containing fluorinated polymers, has been reported in the literature as there are \nother sources of TFA emissions. No dedicated measurements of TFA and other small organofluorine \nmolecules have been reported from incineration experiments, which largely focus on PFOS and PFOA \nmonitoring. Considering that in pilot studies of co-incineration of PTFE, the fluorine mass balance from HF \nwas only 56% at 870 \u02daC and a 4 second residence time, and 78% at 1 020 \u02daC and a 2.7 second residence \ntime (Aleksandrov et al., 2019), other potential organofluorine releases like TFA and CF4 should be \nassessed in addition to the potential formation of other inorganic fluorides. \n\nFurthermore, chemical recycling, for example pyrolysis, of plastic is increasingly promoted and due to their \ndispersive uses, fluorinated polymers will likely end-up in chemical recycling processes. As a result, the \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 74 \n\nmaterial flow of fluorinated polymers entering plastic pyrolysis and chemical recycling and associated \nreleases of fluorinated GHG and ODS should be analysed. \n\nPFOA and other PFAS can be emitted from municipal waste incineration. No reliable European data have \nbeen found but incineration of waste has increased in Europe since the ban of the disposal of \nbiodegradable waste at landfills (EUROSTAT, 2020). Nonetheless, it can be assumed that PFOA and a broad \nrange of other PFAS are formed, with large differences in emission volumes between the European \ncountries, due to the burning of domestic waste with different emission factors. Additionally, the amount \nof fluorinated polymers present in burned waste may vary due to differences in the composition of waste \ncollected across European countries. \n\nThe landfilling rate of municipal waste in Europe has decreased from 44% in 2006 to 23% in 2017. Annual \nemissions of PFAS from consumer products disposed of in landfill are estimated to be 0.43\u20133.7 tonnes in \nEurope (calculated based on population in 37 European countries). However, for a reliable assessment of \nreleases from landfills more data from standardised monitoring programmes are needed. The emissions \nto air, soil and water from landfills depends on measures taken at the landfills to prevent rainwater \nentering the waste and minimising water transport and gas emission from the landfill body. In old landfills, \nseals are often missing, and leakage may occur. Waste from applications containing fluorinated polymers \nfrom the transport, chemicals and energy production sectors may, at end of life, end up in smelters if used \nas coatings or integrated parts in metals, or in shredder waste if used in wires or cables from, for example, \nvehicles. \n\nWastewater treatment plants are an important point source of PFAS to the surrounding environment; \nstudies show that treated wastewater contain some level of PFAS. There is, however, a lack of information \non fluorinated polymers influx to wastewater plants, and efflux of PFAS from fluorinated polymers in \nsludge, water and to air from wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, microplastics from the intentional \nuse of fluoropolymers in, for example, consumer products such as personal care products and bicycle \nlubricants, and from degradation and abrasion of fluorinated polymer materials and surfaces may end up \nin wastewater plants from where these pollutants can further end up in water, soil and air. The regulation \nof fluorinated polymers and intentional uses of microplastics are further described in Section 8.2. \n\n7.5 Examples of impact reductions from the replacement of fluorinated polymers \n\nIn many applications, the properties of fluorinated polymers make their replacement challenging in terms \nof equal performance of materials. Only a few studies have been found in literature of the reduction of \nenvironmental impacts as a result of replacing fluorinated polymers. Articles, such as on alternative \nmaterials for fluorinated polymers in fuel cells for the production of renewable energy, focus on their \nreplacement for cost reduction purposes. \n\nBox 7.1 provides an example of replacing materials containing fluorinated polymers in photovoltaic panels, \nthereby reducing their environmental impacts once they become waste. The fluorinated polymeric \nbacksheets are used to protect the panels from moisture and adverse weathering and lengthen their \noperational lives (Figure 7.1). In Section 8.4.1.5, the use of PTFE in photovoltaic panels in a circular and \nnon-toxic economy is discussed further. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 75 \n\nBox 7.1 Comparison of end-of-life treatment of photovoltaic panels containing fluorinated and nonfluorinated polymers \n\nThe production of solar energy using photovoltaic panels, which have a lifespan of 25\u201330 years is expected \nto increase significantly in coming years. In 2016, global photovoltaic waste for the year was estimated to \nbe 45 000 tonnes and it is likely that this will increase to 1.7 million tonnes by 2030 and 60 million tonnes \nby 2050 (Aryan et al., 2018). Fluorinated polymers are used as a protective layer in the backsheet of \nphotovoltaic panels, making up roughly 3% of the backsheet material\u2019s weight or approximately 0.2% of \nweight of the whole panel. \n\nA lifecycle analysis (Aryan et al., 2018) compared the environmental impacts of two potential end-of-life \nmanagement scenarios \u2013 incineration and pyrolysis \u2013 of fluorinated and non-fluorinated backsheets. In \nthe incineration scenario, the non-fluorinated backsheets showed environmental benefits in 11 of 12 \nimpact categories evaluated  \u2013 the exception being for GWP. The corresponding pyrolysis scenario showed \nbetter environmental performance for the non-fluorinated backsheets in 8 of 12 categoires. However, the \npyrolysis scenario revealed a high release of HF and the presence of significant amounts of fluorine both \nin the form of toxic halogenated hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis products. This \nsuggests that pyrolysis for the non-fluorinated backsheets is not as environmentally feasible as it is for of \nbackshees containing fluorinated polymers. Additionally, pyrolysis is generally less attractive from an \neconomic viewpoint. \n\nThe lifecycle study concludes that non-fluorinated backsheets containing bio- or polyethylene \nterephthalate-based alternative materials are to be recommended. For fluorinated backsheets, the \npreferred management option is incineration together with other waste materials in order to comply with \nenvironmental emission requirements. In addition, it is proposed that the producers should provide \ninformation on the materials in the backsheet, using, for example, ecolabels, to ensure the waste receives \nappropriate end-of-life treatment. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1.

Using PTFE \ncould hamper circular potential and is not line with the ambitions of the Commission in the \nChemicals Strategy for Sustainability. \n\n\u2022 Within the overall process of risk governance, there are different options to implement criteria for \nessential use. \n\n\u2022 There is a need to unambiguously define criteria or considerations for essential use to enable \napplication of the concept in decision making processes. \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\nThis chapter examines to what extent the main elements in current risk governance of fluorinated \npolymers are in line with a CE, a low carbon economy and a toxic-free environment strategy, with a specific \nfocus on the circular economy, using a systematic approach based on the International Risk Governance \nCouncil (IRGC) risk governance framework. More specifically, it is discussed the question whether changes \nare needed in the governance of substances of (potential) concern, and specifically for fluorinated \npolymers. Risk governance marks out institutional structures and sociopolitical processes that guide and \nrestrain collective activities of a group, society, or international community to influence or direct the \ncourse of events or people\u2019s behaviour when dealing with risk issues (IRGC, 2017; Renn and Klinke, 2016; \nKlinke and Renn, 2012), Further, the concept of essential use has been introduced in the CSS. In this \nchapter, no difference is made between the various types of fluorinated polymers, and for illustrative \npurposes some examples are added. \n\nThe risk governance of fluorinated polymers in a circular economy should be seen as part of the broader \ndiscussion on the European Green Deal. As mentioned in Chapter 1, a set of policy objectives have been \nformulated in the European Green Deal by the European Commission with the overarching goal of making \nEurope climate neutral by 2050 (Commission, 2019). It provides an action plan to: \n\n1. boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean CE and; \n2. restore biodiversity and prevent pollution from being generated. \n\nIn a CE the amount of harmful substances will preferably be lower and no harmful substances will be \nreleased from the technosphere (production, consumption and end-of-life). Both a chemical of interest \nand the related product come with their own lifecycles. Chemical lifecycles span the entire supply chain \nfor harvesting resources, synthesising, and processing a chemical, and related waste handling. Product \nlifecycles do not only cover the considered and other chemicals included in the same product with their \nrespective supply chains, but also include resources used and emissions related to energy converted \nduring, for example, product manufacturing, use, and end-of-life handling including recycling (Fantke et \nal., 2020). \n\nIn Section 8.2 an overview of challenges in the regulation of fluorinated polymers is given, and in Section \n8.3 a short introduction to the IRGC framework is presented. This is continued with a discussion of whether \nfluorinated polymers fit in a CE (Section 8.4) and in what way the concept of essential use may support \nrisk governance of fluorinated polymers and the consequences of specific implementations of the concept \n(Section 8.5). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 77 \n\n8.2 Challenges in the regulation of fluorinated polymers \n\nPFAS have become a matter of regulatory and public concern due to their persistency, bioaccumulation, \nand possible ecological and human health effects. To date, there is both vertical and horizontal legislation \nthat apply to PFAS. Vertical regulations are those that address part of a lifecycle, including work-place \nexposure, emissions during production, risks during use, or the waste-management and end-of-life phases. \nThe vertical regulations should comply with the REACH requirements which is a horizontal legislation. \n\nA (non-exhaustive) summary of different international and European regulations on PFAS is presented in \nthe Annex 3. \n\nFluorinated polymers are known to be extremely persistent and there is evidence that they do not degrade \nunder environmental conditions (Ameduri, 2020). In addition, the use of the different fluorinated polymers \nmight cause several environmental and human health risks throughout their lifecycle(s). First, the \nproduction of some fluorinated polymers, such as fine powder PTFE and PVDF, is intimately linked to the \nuse of legacy and novel PFAS, for example, ether-based PFAS as emulsifiers during emulsion \npolymerization process. Most of PFAS-based processing aids are considered environmental toxicants of \npotential concern, of which some have been classified as SVHCs (Gebreab et al., 2020, Rice et al., 2021). \nSecond, a variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomer impurities (unintentional non-polymer \nPFAS by-products) are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of \nfluorinated polymers. In general, polymer products contain residual monomers, oligomers, impurities, \ntransformation products and often their properties drive the overall hazard of the polymer products \n(Chapter 4). In addition, intentionally used fluorinated polymer microplastics (PTFE microparticles) \n(Sections 5.5 and 5.6) may generate nanoplastics as (bio)degradation products of these microplastics that \nmay have higher bioaccumulation potential inducing potentially adverse health effects. There are further \nconcerns regarding the safe disposal of fluorinated polymers and their associated products and articles at \nthe end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluorinated polymers is performed on some \nindustrial waste repositories, only limited options exist for their recycling from consumer articles (Sections \n6.1 and 6.2) (Lohmann et al., 2020). Regulating fluorinated polymers is a complex task because it needs to \naddress all phases in the lifecycle of these chemicals. \n\nRecently, under the REACH regulation the national authorities of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, \nNorway and Sweden have started preparing a joint REACH restriction proposal on PFAS as a group to limit \nthe risks to the environment and human health from their manufacture and use. These authorities prefer \na broad restriction covering all different PFAS substances and uses, instead of separate legislation on \nspecific PFAS or specific uses. The broad restriction would limit as many (non-essential) uses as practically \npossible. This would have the greatest impact on preventing and thereby minimising human and \nenvironmental exposure to PFAS. It would also include currently unknown PFAS and uses as well as \nfluorinated polymers and would prevent regrettable substitution of restricted PFAS by other PFAS (RMOA, \n2021 (38)). \n\nMore specifically on fluoropolymers, while polymers are exempted from registration and evaluation in the \nEU under Article 2(9) of the REACH Regulation (EP and Council, 2006) they are not exempted from \nrestriction or authorisation, and the monomers from which a polymer is formed must be registered \n(REACH Article 6(3)). Overall, the REACH Regulation does not exclude the future possibility of a \nrequirement to register polymers. The Regulation has laid down that the European Commission may \npresent criteria to characterise \u2018polymers of concern (PLC)\u2019, justify the selected criteria and may also \npresent criteria for polymers of high concern (PHC); to propose solutions for their grouping as well as \nregistration requirements (PRR) under REACH; and to estimate the potential risks posed by such PLCs in \ncomparison to other chemicals based on available scientific evidence on their hazards and exposure \n\n \n38 Assessment of regulatory needs list - ECHA (europa.eu) \n\nhttps://echa.europa.eu/en/rmoa/-/dislist/details/0b0236e184db2d36\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 78 \n\n(European Commission, 2018). In addition, the derogation from labelling of polymers implemented in the \nCLP based on a lack of bioavailability as an essential determinant for the lack of hazard concerns. \n\nPolymers are also regulated (directly as the final product and indirectly via the monomers, additives and \nprocessing aids) by their use in specific products, such as food-contact materials (FCM) legislation EC \n10/2011 for plastics. Meanwhile any other chemical in the polymer or in the finished material or article \nshould comply with the FCM framework regulation (EC 2004/1935) which sets out the general principles \nof safety and inertness for all FCMs. This includes all FCMs in which fluorinated polymers may be used, \nsuch as food plastics, processing equipment, coatings, paper and board, waxes, inks, and elastomers. Other \nregulations which address products in which fluorinated polymers may be used include medical devices \n(EU Regulation on Medical Devices (MDR) (2017/745) and Regulation on In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) \n(2017/746)), cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and toys. \n\nTo date, there is no regulation under REACH directly on fluorinated polymers. Intentionally used \nfluorinated polymer microplastics are, however, covered in the REACH microplastics restriction if they are \nplaced on the market in a physical form consistent with the microplastics definition, i.e. solid particles \n<5mm in size. A restriction dossier concerning the use of intentionally added microplastic particles to \nconsumer or professional products of any kind is submitted and reviewed by the Committee for Risk \nAssessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC). Currently the proposed \nmicroplastic restriction is awaiting adoption by the European Commission. All uses of polymers with these \nproperties are considered to pose a risk that is not adequately controlled if they are inevitably released to \nthe environment when used. A much greater share of microplastics, however, is from unintentional \nreleases. The microplastics dossier does not differentiate between different plastics/polymers in this \nanalysis. \n\nAt an international level, fluorinated polymers are not eligible for PLC exemption from the premanufacture notification (PMN) review process (US EPA, 2019). In Japan, fluoro groups are designated as \nreactive functional groups (RFGs) preventing a polymer from being a PLC. \n\nRisk assessment of chemicals under REACH can be performed in several ways, depending on the hazardous \nproperties of the substance. Fluorinated polymer products can change their form during different lifecycle \nstages. For these reasons, conventional risk assessment approaches for chemicals may need to be \nmodified for polymers. As the hazardous properties of fluorinated polymers are complex and, in many \ninstances, uncertain, for example, issues surrounding physical availability, bioavailability, persistence, and \ndegradation, a range of risk assessment paradigms could be considered, such as PBT/vPvB perspectives \n(non-threshold approach) and a case-by-case approach. \n\nThe hazardous potential of fluorinated polymers needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into \naccount all relevant physical, chemical, and fate properties. In a case-by-case approach for risk assessment \nof fluorinated polymers, the question is what can be referred to as their extreme persistence in the \nenvironment and the potential for this to result in a non-reversible pollution stock associated with \npotential for environmental and/or human health risks. Overall, substantial data gaps with respect to \nexposure to as well as toxicity of fluorinated polymers impede risk assessments. \n\nCurrently, most studies on the potential risks of fluorinated polymers are limited to the use phase. The \nlack of provisions covering the whole lifecycle assessment (production/use/waste management) of \nfluorinated polymers and/or their feedstocks leads to insufficient regulation as shown in previous chapters \nof this report. Therefore, in the case of fluorinated polymers, the application of a risk governance strategy \nfor the entire lifecycle, from development to end-of-life, is necessary to prevent potential risks. \n\n8.3 The IRGC risk governance framework \n\nThe IRGC Framework recommends an holistic, multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder approach to \nsupport the identification, assessment and management of risks. Furthermore, it supports processes that \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 79 \n\naim to provide and structure scientific evidence about a risk in a societal context. It helps decision makers \nanalyse the major ambiguities and controversies that may affect the management of such risks (IRGC, \n2017). \n\nFigure 8.1 shows the IRGC risk governance framework. There is a clear division between understanding a \nrisk, generating and evaluating knowledge, and deciding about a risk, decision making and management \n(IRGC, 2017, Renn, 2009). The risk governance process is structured into four distinct phases as follows: \n\n1. The first phase is the pre-assessment of a risk. This captures and describes the various perspectives \nof stakeholders and society, regarding, for instance, the use of fluorinated polymers, including \ncurrent approaches to the regulation of these substances. Moreover, this phase includes \ndetermining scientific conventions, looking for information through an early warning system and \nscreening information. \n\n2. The second phase comprises risk and concern assessment. The concern assessment includes an \nassessment of socio-economic impacts, an analysis of risk perceptions and of wider societal \nconcerns. \n\n3. The third phase focusses on knowledge characterisation and risk evaluation. In particular, risk \ninformation can be characterised as simple, complex, uncertain or ambiguous, or, most likely, a \ncombination of these. This has implications for stakeholder participation and risk management \nstrategies. \n\n4. Finally, the fourth phase of the framework focusses on risk management decision making \u2013 taking \naction to reduce and control risks. Risk management includes the generation, assessment, \nevaluation and selection of appropriate management strategies, decisions about a specific \nstrategy and alternative options, and the implementation and enforcement of such strategies. \nCross cutting issues in the framework are stakeholder participation and communication. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 80 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.1. The IRGC risk governance framework. \n\nSource: International Risk Governance Council (2017) \n\n8.4 Assessing PTFE in the risk governance process in the context of a circular economy \n\nAs fluorinated polymers are diverse to assess, this section considers PTFE, the most used fluorinated \npolymer, as an example. The first focus is on PTFE in a CE. In Section 4.1.5 the entanglement between using \nPTFE in a CE and a low-carbon and toxic-free economy is described. These concepts are obviously linked, \nas one of the main drivers for a CE is to drastically cut GHG emissions, driving Europe towards the goals \nset by the IPCC Paris Agreement (Foundation, 2019). Additionally, a toxic free/zero pollution approach is \nnecessary for achieving a truly sustainable CE. \n\nImportant characteristics for realising a CE are also found at the heart of the IRGC framework: \ncommunication, stakeholder engagement and context (Figure 8.1). \n\n8.4.1 Pre-assessment phase \n\nPTFE is first assessed using criteria suggested by the working group on identifying polymers requiring \nregistration under REACH (DG Environment (COM), 2020). This assessment is for the use of the polymer \nonly, the (circular) system or lifecycle of the polymer is not considered. Next a short evaluation of PTFE in \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 81 \n\na CE is described. This is set out against the different parts of the IRGC framework. The link with a lowcarbon toxic-free economy is described subsequently. \n\n8.4.2 Appraisal phase \n\nThe assessment of PTFE by the suggested criteria identifying polymers requiring registration (\u2018polymers of \nconcern\u2019) is shown in Figure 8.2. From this assessment it follows that PTFE is not a polymer requiring \nregistration when being considered in the use phase only. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.2. PTFE assessment for polymer requiring registration by the criteria from the (European Commission. \nDirectorate General for Environment. et al., 2020) \n\n* The exact criteria can be found in the referred report. \n\nSource: ETC/CME  \n\nThis approach for PTFE as a specific polymer indicates that it is not sufficiently risky to be of concern. As \ndescribed in the next chapter, PTFE is, however, considered to be of concern in a CE. \n\n8.4.3 Characterization and evaluation phase \n\nFrom a system perspective of a CE, PTFE appears to be of concern \u2013 see, for example, Section 7.4 in which \nthe environmental impacts of the waste stage of PTFE are described). That comes apparent when the \nwhole life cycle of PTFE is considered. The lifecycle of fluorinated polymers, including emissions, is shown \nin Figure 1.2 and a more general lifecycle of material flows in a CE is shown in the Figure 8.3 below. The \nfollowing areas of concern are identified. \n\n\u2022 Production: in the production of PTFE hazardous processing aids are used, such as Gen-X, which \ncan be released during the production, formulation or use phase (down-the-drain release from \nconsumer products) or during incineration (Section 4.9). \n\n\u2022 Use and biosphere recovery of products in the biological cycle: in a CE products are developed for \ncirculating either in a biological cycle (consumption products) or a technical cycle (service \nproducts). Consumption products in this context are those at are literally consumed during their \nlifecycle through (physical) degradation or abrasion. Examples of biological-cycle products which \nmay contain PTFE include lubricants, cosmetics and paper products. The use of PTFE in these \ncauses the release of PTFE to the environment and thus does not allow its safe degradation and \nnutrient recovery (biosphere recovery). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 82 \n\n\u2022 End-of-life treatment and recycling (technical cycle). First of all, the PTFE polymer has very strong \nchemical bonds which are not easily broken when heated. Recycling techniques used for \nconventional thermosetting plastics such as polyethylene cannot, therefore, be applied for PTFE. \nThere are some innovations to tackle this issue, for example, the university of Bayreuth has \ndeveloped a depolymerization process in cooperation with InVerTec and the 3M Dyneon company \n( 39 ). It uses pyrolysis to decompose perfluorinated polymers into gaseous monomers. After \ncleaning the latter, they are then fed back into the manufacture of new materials; a pilot plant \nwas built in 2015, however its current status is unclear. To the best knowledge of the authors of \nthis chapter, there are no other industrial recycling facilities for PTFE in operation. \n\n\u2022 The collection of PTFE polymers is challenging because it is widely used as part of a multi-layered \ncomplex products such as seals, membranes and films. Another widespread application of PTFE is \nas surface treatment or coating in which it is irreversibly connected with the base material, such \nas textile fibres. This could also hinder the recycling of the base material. Heating PTFE causes toxic \nfumes, therefore recycling techniques using higher temperatures may result in increased risks for \nworkers. \n\n\u2022 The incineration of fluoropolymers has great GHG emissions potential. \n\nIn Figure 8.3 so-called R-strategies are shown along the material flows, R1 to R6. These are developed to \nreduce the consumption of resources and materials in product chains and make the economy more \ncircular. The R-strategies typically present a range of strategies ordered from high circularity (low Rnumbers) to low circularity (high R-numbers), as a rule of thumb. These elaborate on the Ladder van \nLansink, a tool for the priority setting of waste treatment methods (Potting et al., 2017). A more detailed \nexplanation can be found in the report by Kishna et al. (2018) (only in Dutch) or for example in the study \nconducted by Morseletto et al. examining which targets can facilitate the transition to a CE (Morseletto, \n2020). Since PTFE is difficult and costly to either recycle (R5) or repair/remanufacture (R4), using this \nmaterial could hamper circular potential, as shown in Figure 8.3. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.3. A schematic view of possible flows of materials in a circular economy. \n\nSource: van Bruggen et al. (2021) \n\n \n39 https://www.plasteurope.com/news/DYNEON_t230856/ (accessed July 2021) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 83 \n\nThese above mentioned considerations and R-strategies are not part of the framework for the criteria to \nidentify and group polymers for registration/evaluation under REACH and their impact assessment \n(European Commission. Directorate General for Environment. et al., 2020), but should be taken in account \nwhen the use of PTFE is assessed in a CE. For a low carbon and toxic-free economy the R-strategies could \nalso provide valuable insights. \n\n8.4.4 Risk management phase \n\nIn a recent report by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) several \nrecommendations for the management of SVHCs in a CE have been made (van Bruggen et al., 2021; \nBeekman et al., 2020). These recommendations could also apply in a more general sense to other \nsubstances of concern including polymers. The Institute acknowledges that the economy is still \npredominantly linear and that a transition to a CE is needed. This transition provides opportunities for the \nmanagement of substances of concern and the monitoring of their use. There are three challenges. \n\nThe first is the need to share information about substances throughout the entire product chain. In a \ncircular economy products and materials, including the substances they contain, are used as inputs for a \ncircular loop. Consequently, it is crucial that there is access to information across the product chain about \nthe substances used and their safety. Currently, this information is available at the production phase of \nfluorinated polymers, but lost further down the chain. \n\nThe second challenge is for various parties in the chain to take responsibility for the safe use and re-use of \nsubstances in materials and products. Manufacturers have a responsibility for safe and sustainable design. \nThis implies that products are designed with the aim of safe use and re-use depending on their \npredetermined application. Moreover, users and companies further down the chain have a responsibility \nfor safe use and recycling and they must be enabled to take it. \n\nAs becomes clear from the description of the different phases of the IRGC Framework in the governance \nof substances in a CE, communication and stakeholder participation is needed in all phases of the process. \nThe description above shows that this also holds for the processes needed for risk management in a CE. \nAlthough the IRGC framework is not specifically designed for one, the communication and stakeholder \nparticipation in the framework support the challenges identified. \n\nThe third and final challenge concerns the responsible management of substances in a CE, when phasing \nout is impossible or no longer possible. Within these substances, a distinction is made between: \n\na. legacy substances: those that are no longer allowed in new products but are still present in \nproducts in circulation, such as the presence of PFOA in existing sprinkler installations; \n\nb. essential uses: for certain applications \u2013 certainly in the short and medium term \u2013 substances of \nconcern are necessary because of their specific functionality and therefore cannot be phased out \ncompletely; \n\nc. as yet unknown substances of concern: harmful effects usually only become clear (long) after the \nintroduction of new substances \u2013 as knowledge continues to develop, substances that are not yet \na cause for concern may, in the future, be classified as SVHCs; \n\nd. changes in the use of essential substances of concern due to developments in society: as a result \nof the rapid development of innovations, but also due to changing requirements imposed by \nsociety, there may be shifts in the demand for and supply of substances. \n\nIn Beekman et al. (2020) several examples are given of the above mentioned categories (Beekman et al., \n2020). \n\nThe above mentioned RIVM report also provides an analysis of possible indicators and sources of \ninformation for monitoring SVHCs in a CE. A distinction is made between process indicators and effect \nindicators. Some of these may be operational in the short term because they are based on information \nwhich is currently available. Others call for the active collection of additional information that is currently \nnot available or only partially. To obtain a comprehensive picture of hazardous substances in a CE, it is \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 84 \n\nimportant to start monitoring wherever possible and, at the same time, work on obtaining additional \ninformation that is not yetavailable. In a sequel report, a method for the monitoring of hazardous \nsubstances (Dutch, ZZS) in a CE is proposed (van Bruggen et al., 2021). \n\nMonitoring fluoropolymers, or PFAS, in a CE is necessary because of environmental and possible human \nhazards as mentioned in Section 4.1.3, and because of related GHG emissions over their lifecycle as shown \nin this report. To make just considerations on their human and environmental impacts of material/product \nflows, transparent data is essential. Probably several indicators are needed and identified knowledge gaps \nalong the lifecycle of fluorinated polymers (Table 9.1) should be filled as soon as possible. \n\n8.4.5 PTFE use in solar photovoltaic panels \n\nPTFE has many applications including use in renewable energy applications (Sections 6.1; 7.3; and 7.5). For \nexample, many solar photovoltaic (PV) panels have a backsheet coated with PTFE. The PTFE on the \nbacksheet is difficult to recycle which hampers the circular possibilities of a solar PV panel. The backsheet \nmaterial can also be from glass or (bio)PET alternatives, which do not need a PTFE coating. Using glass \nmight initially be more expensive, but it improves the recyclability of the panel significantly, and thereby \nits circular potential, decreasing the overall environmental burden. Significant GHG are produced in the \nproduction and end-of-life treatment of the PTFE in solar PVs, just like in a linear economy. This does not \nfit well with the aim of a low carbon economy minimising emissions of GHG. Next to that, difficulties to \nproperly recycle or reuse the PTFE makes it difficult to keep it in different product cycles, without being \nwasted. And, as already mentioned, the widespread use of PTFE is a real challenge and difficult to justify \nin a toxic-free economy. The transition towards renewable energy is obviously necessary but the \nperspective of the whole system should be considered all along the way. Sustainable applications should \nbe able to be circular and toxic-free over their entire lifecycles. This holds especially for such non-crucial \nparts as a solar PV backsheet for which circular design is already an option (Contreras-Lisperguer et al., \n2021). \n\nTo realize the EU Green Deal ideals of a circular, low carbon and pollutant-free economy, renewable energy \nsolutions should be safe and sustainable by design (see the CSS) (EC, 2020). Using a material like PTFE in \nsolar PV solutions seems not to be in line with these ambitions. \n\nExamples of (truly) sustainable energy production provide a link between the concept of essential use and \nthe concepts of a low-carbon, circular and toxic-free economy. Benefits and burdens of PTFE use can only \nbe compared by performing an integrated assessment covering the environmental and human impacts \nduring the whole lifecycle. \n\n8.5 Applying the concept of essential use in the risk governance process \n\n8.5.1 The concept of essential use in the European Chemical Strategy for Sustainability towards \ntoxic free environment \n\nThe concept of essential use has been introduced in CSS, a document of the European Commission (EC, \n2020) providing a long-term vision for the EU chemicals policy. The CSS suggests the adoption of a generic \napproach to risk management of particularly harmful chemicals used in consumer products unless their \nuse is deemed to be essential. Specific attention is given to the use of PFAS due to their ubiquitous use \nand global exposure which is considered to lead to expected yearly health related costs of EUR 52-84 billion \n(Goldenman et al. 2019). \n\nIn the CSS, the European Commission proposes a ban of PFAS manufacture and use within Europe, \nexempting those uses that are considered essential from a societal perspective (EP, 2021). This, obviously, \npresupposes that criteria of essentiality can both be defined and operationalized in a non-ambiguous way. \nRegarding the definition of and possible criteria for defining essentiality, the CSS refers to the Montreal \nProtocol, a multilateral environmental agreement for phasing-out ozone-depleting substances, in which \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 85 \n\ncriteria for essential use have been specified and applied to a few exceptional cases (Protocol, 1987) (40). \nSpecifically, the Protocol states in Decision IV/25 that \u201ca use of a controlled substance should qualify as \n\u2018essential\u2019 if and only if (i) it is necessary for the health, safety or is critical for the functioning of society \n(encompassing cultural and intellectual aspects); and (ii) there are no available technically and \neconomically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment \nand health\u201d (Figure 8.4). \n\n \n\nFigure 8.4. Criteria for essential use of chemicals as specified in the Montreal Protocol. \n\nSource: Montreal Protocol (1987). \n\nThis implies that exemptions from control measures such as bans lead to societal benefits because of the \nessentiality and must be balanced against the consequences of such exemptions, in particular the costs of \nswitching to safe(r) chemicals or technologies and negative impacts due on-going emissions. Identifying \nthe use of a chemical of concern as essential is, therefore, a sufficient but not a necessary condition for its \nongoing use. The obvious need for balanced decision making has also been adopted in REACH (ECHA, 2011; \n2008), under which detailed information about alternative substances and technologies is mandatory in \norder to come to an informed decision about authorisation \u2013 the formal approval to continue one or \nseveral uses of a SVHC for a defined period) \u2013 and is used in the decision-process to assess the benefits \nand costs of the proposed restriction \u2013 the enforcement of control measures to eliminate the risks from \nproducing, manufacturing or marketing a substance \u2013 of chemicals. \n\nFor PFAS in particular, Cousins et al. (2019) suggested to distinguish essential from substitutable and nonessential uses. While the first two categories differ only with regard to the availability or lack of alternative \nsubstances and technologies, the latter category denotes uses that are \u201cpurely driven by market \nopportunity\u201d (Cousins et al., 2019). Similar to the Montreal Protocol, they assume chemical uses \ncontributing to health and safety, for example occupational medical clothing, are likely to be essential. \nDental floss or ski waxes, on the contrary, are considered non-essential because these uses do not \ncontribute to health and safety purposes. In contrast to the Montreal Protocol, Cousins et al. (2019) do \nnot consider the economic and technical feasibility (functionality) of alternatives, and the potential \nenvironmental implications of alternative chemicals or technologies. \n\nSo far, there is no consensus on the criteria for determining essential use, and how to distinguish essential \nfrom non-essential ones of chemicals in consumer products. While criteria such as health and safety have \nalready been adopted in the Montreal Protocol and are also likely to receive broad acceptance for risk \ngovernance of harmful chemicals in consumer products, it is largely unclear whether there are other \ncriteria reflecting societal preferences or values considered essential. In addition, it is unclear what criteria \ncould identify uses that are critical for the functioning of society. Other relevant questions are who should \ndecide on these criteria, and how to assess whether or not one or several criteria are met. Moreover, it \nhas been recognised that societal opinions about what defines the use of a harmful chemical as essential \n\n \n40 https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol/ \n\n\u2022 It is necessary for health\n\n\u2022 It is necessary for safety\n\u2022 It is necessary for other highly relevant \n\npurposes\n\n\u2022 It is critical for the functioning of society\n\n\u2022 There are no technical and economically \n\nfeasible alternatives\n\u2022 There are no alternatives/substitutes \n\nwhich are acceptable from the standpoint \n\nof environment and health\n\u2022 There are no alternatives/substitutes that \n\nprovide the necessary technical function \nand performance\n\nAND\n\nBenefits side of chemical use Cost side of chemical use\n\nhttps://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol/meetings/fourth-meeting-parties-montreal-protocol/decisions/decision-4\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 86 \n\nor critical are probably not static but can change over time and are influenced by culture (Bouman et al., \n2021, EuropeanCommission, 2020). Addressing these issues is, therefore, not trivial because, obviously, \nthe identification of criteria is value-driven and the consequences of an implementation of any criteria can \nhave substantial impacts on society. Note that these challenges are not new, and different scientific \ndisciplines, including social psychology and economics, have proposed methodologies of how the \nunderlying challenge of value, preference elicitation and prioritization, can be approached (Schwartz, \n2017; Schwartz, 2012; Dietz et al., 2005; Cameron et al., 2002; Fischhoff, 1996). \n\nWhile discussing the practical implementation of the concept of essential use for risk governance of \nfluorinated polymers does not seem not meaningful in the absence of relevant criteria, it is possible to \ndiscuss possible implications of using the concept in the risk governance process using the risk governance \nframework suggested by the IRGC as reference. In particular, the implications of essential use \nconsiderations implemented early or late in the risk governance process are included. \n\nOne possible option for improving current risk governance and legislation, such as REACH, of fluorinated \npolymers is the implementation of the essential use concept in the risk management procedure. The IRGC \nframework could be used as a reference with the aim of providing a balanced overview of the implications \nof applying the concept of essential use. \n\n8.5.1.1 Pre-assessment phase \n\nAn inventory of the uses of fluorinated polymers can be conducted during the pre-assessment phase. \nAssuming that criteria reflecting a societal consensus on essential uses of fluorinated polymers can be \ndefined, and that these are based on a societal consensus, the uses which are, according to these criteria, \nnot essential, can be identified. Defining non-essential uses early in the risk governance process implies \nthat time- and resource-demanding follow-up steps such as hazard identification, exposure/vulnerability \nassessment and risk characterisation (first part of the appraisal phase) may no longer be required for these \nuses. Furthermore, an assessment of impacts could become redundant. The expectation is that this will \nsimplify and accelerate the risk governance process. Hence, filtering out some uses of fluorinated polymers \nearly in the risk governance process may be resource saving and accelerate risk management decision \nmaking about these substances. It should be noted, however, that considering uses of fluorinated \npolymers to be non-essential could also imply that possible benefits of these uses will be lost. This, \nhowever, occurs at the expense of in-depth insights into positive and negative impacts of such uses. In \nother words: non-essentiality criteria define a use to be socially irrelevant from the outset. This implies \nthat the spheres of understanding and deciding (Figure 8.2) that are traditionally well delineated will \nbecome entangled. \n\n8.5.1.2 Appraisal phase \n\nIf non-essential uses are excluded in the pre-assessment phase, a detailed assessment of concerns would \nthen focus on essential uses only in the appraisal phase of risk governance. A concern is a multidimensional concept and includes a proper understanding of stakeholder perceptions and a systematic \nanalysis of socio-economic impacts of the use of fluorinated polymers. It is important to note that impacts \ndo not only arise from an on-going use of fluorinated polymers, but can also emerge from implementing \nrisk management measures, for example through the use of alternative substances or technologies. \nConsequently, identifying fluorinated polymer uses that are deemed to be essential does not overcome \nthe need to assess and balance different types of impacts in order to approve a continued use. In \nparticular, essentiality is not a cutoff criterion for unbound continued use. Rather, acknowledging that \ncriteria of essentiality reflect the benefits side of chemical use (i.e. the societal goals or values to which a \ncertain use contributes), these benefits must be contrasted with the negative impacts of a use on human \nhealth, the environment or the economy. Likewise, assessing costs and impacts of potential alternative \nsubstances and technologies remains crucial to stimulate innovation towards safe(r) alternatives on one \nhand, and to prevent regrettable substitution on the other. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 87 \n\nAnother option is to introduce criteria of essential use slightly later in the risk governance process; in the \nappraisal phase. The question is, then, in what way criteria of essential use can complement or support \nthe assessment of concerns and socio-economic impacts. Under REACH, socio-economic analysis (SEA) has \nbecome a well-established toolbox for conducting such assessments for REACH authorisation and \nrestriction procedures, but also beyond (Garc\u00eda-Ayll\u00f3n, 2019; Georgiou et al., 2018; Pery et al., 2013). \nAdopting a social welfare perspective, SEA is a comprehensive and comprehensible assessment toolbox \nthat seeks to assess and compare all impacts with an expected welfare effect. In applications for \nauthorisation, SEA is informed by an analysis of alternatives (AoA), in which applicants have to identify \navailable alternatives and provide an assessment of their technical and economic feasibility and the time \nscale for the implementation of possible alternatives (ECHA, 2021). In reality, however, impacts have not \nalways been straightforward to quantify and to monetise. Specifically, environmental impacts have often \nbeen assessed qualitatively only due to a lack of data and a lack of methodological integration of the \navailable information about chemical properties into economic methods (Gabbert and Hilber, 2020). While \nin the absence of quantitative data the use of qualitative reasoning is a legitimate way forward, it still \nrequires that the key characteristics of a concern, such as high or extreme persistence, are appropriately \ntransported in the overall balancing of impacts. Similarly, the quality of AoA\u2019s have often been a matter of \ndebate since applicants have not always been able to convincingly show that alternatives were lacking, or \nnot feasible from a technical or economic point of view (Navin-Jones, 2019). This led to criticism of some \ndecisions on granting authorisation to chemicals, and of exemptions from restrictions (Tickner and Jacobs, \n2016), as it was argued that these uses were not necessary for social health and safety. This implies that \nthere is probably scope for improvement of specific components in SEAs. Environmental impact \nassessment in SEAs, for example, could be strengthened by developing integrated methods linking \nenvironmental data and assessments using economic methods (Gabbert and Hilber, 2020). This requires, \nfirst and foremost, close interdisciplinary collaboration. \n\nWhere it is possible to address all relevant impacts quantitatively, for example, by means of a cost-benefit \nanalysis, it is debatable whether the underlying efficiency argument of welfare economics is always the \nbest or only argument for deciding about chemicals\u2019 use. In law and ordinary moral reasoning, the \navoidance of harm, the benefits of risk management measures, can have priority over the provision of \ncosts (Geistfeld, 2019; Keating, 2018,). Within the welfare economic SEA approach such preferences can \nbe reflected by attaching higher weight to the benefits compared to the costs involved in taking measures \nto avoid risks and, ultimately, damage. \n\nPrioritising the avoidance of harm may be regarded as the added value of essential use in comparison to \nexisting regulatory frameworks. This holds predominantly for those regulatory frameworks which lack a \ntransparent, method-based approach for assessing and balancing impacts such as a SEA, for example the \nEuropean Biocidal Products Regulation (41). It can also reflect different normative perspectives on how to \nmanage the risks arising from chemicals\u2019 use. Research on expert roles in policy advice illustrates that \nthere exist different interpretations of precaution, and can therefore also reach different conclusions on \nhow to deal with risk and uncertainty (Spruijt et al., 2016; Silva and Jenkins\u2010Smith, 2007; Weiss, 2003). This \ndepends on the decision context and the specific problem at hand. By including the concept of essential \nuse in regulatory frameworks, in particular for most hazardous substances in a CE, the (societal) voice of \nthose who prefer to act on the side of caution may be strengthened. \n\n8.5.1.3 Characterization and evaluation phase \n\nIn the risk evaluation phase, the evidence based on the risk and concern assessment is combined with a \nthorough evaluation of other factors which have not already been included in the analysis of concern. Such \nfactors can include societal values, economic and political considerations provided that they have not \nexplicitly been addressed in the assessment of concerns. Risks can be acceptable (no risk reduction \nneeded), tolerable (because of benefits, but risk reduction measures are needed) or intolerable (risks \nshould simply be avoided). Again, criteria of essential use can provide information about basic, \n\n \n41 EUR-Lex - 32012R0528 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu) \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012R0528\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 88 \n\nundisputable social values. If applied in the evaluation phase of the risk governance process, the concept \nof essential use does not impact the hazard, risk or impact assessment process. Rather, it can provide an \nalert to policy-makers to explicitly consider these values when adopting risk management decisions. \n\n8.5.1.4 Risk management phase \n\nBased on the considerations above, Figure 8.5 illustrates two options for the implementation of the \nconcept of essential use. The first option (Figure 8.5a) requires an a priori definition of criteria, based on a \nsocietal consensus. If applied early in the risk governance process, this might help to reduce resources \nrequired for a hazard, risk or impact assessment, and might speed up decision making. At the same time, \nthis approach will lead to less information about hazardous effects, risks and impacts of chemicals. \nFurthermore, regular and EU-wide update-assessments of essentiality criteria will be needed to ensure \nobjectivity and relevance of the concept over time. \n\nIn Figure 8.5b criteria of essential use are defined after the regulatory assessments. The benefit of such an \napproach could be that the concept of essential use is only needed for uses without good alternatives; \nmany issues might already have been solved in the socio-economic assessment in the appraisal phase. This \nwill answer the needs of those who prefer precaution over the balancing of positive and negative impacts \nin risk management, as it corrects undesirable outcomes of a SEA. Moreover, with this order it is possible \nto keep the distinction between the understanding and deciding spheres in risk governance. The \ndisadvantage is that this is a case-by-case approach in which the assessment of hazards, risks and impacts \nis not accelerated. \n\nFigures 8.5a and b illustrate two possible options for the implementation of the concept of essential use. \nOther options, including parallel or iterative assessments, could be explored. As shown, the way the \nconcept of essential use is implemented, will affect other parts of the management of the risks of \n(hazardous) chemicals. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.5a.

Adding essential use (in yellow) after regulatory assessments. \n\n8.6 Discussion and Conclusion \n\nThis chapter discussed key elements of risk governance of fluorinated polymers in a CE and reflected on \npossible options for applying the concept of essential use. \n\nThe IRGC framework supports the idea that the inclusion of stakeholders during all phases of the \ngovernance process is needed in a CE. This need is amplified by the assessment of PTFE using the proposed \ncriteria for evaluation of polymers of concern. In there, only the possible hazards of the polymer during \nthe use phase are assessed. It shows that this is too shallow in the framework of a CE. Therefore, the whole \nlifecycle should be assessed, including, for example, persistency and leakage to the biosphere. To realise \nthe EU Green Deal ideals of a circular, low carbon and chemical pollution-free economy, the benefits and \nburdens of, for example, PTFE use could only be assessed using an integrated assessment. This should \ncover the environmental and human impacts of the chemical\u2019s entire lifecycle, including GHG potential.  \nAn integrated assessment also provides a link between the concept of essential use and the concepts of a \nlow-carbon, circular and toxic-free economy. \n\nLinking the concept of essential use to risk governance, it is concluded that there can be different options \nin implementing criteria of essential use, assuming that they have been defined unambiguously. \nSpecifically, criteria can be applied at an early stage, even prior to a case-by-case hazard, risk or impact \nassessment. This can help to reduce resources, time and, ultimately, costs because chemicals in nonessential uses can be removed from the market immediately. The assessment of hazards, risks and socioeconomic impacts will, then, focus on those chemicals which are part of essential uses. Well-defined \ncriteria of essential use could, therefore, provide more opportunities for risk governance of fluorinated \npolymers than are currently used in the EU. This also implies, however, less information and data about \nhazards, risks or impacts for chemicals in non-essential uses. There can, therefore, also be arguments in \nfavour of using criteria for essential use at a later stage of the risk governance process. Given this tradeoff, decision making on what route to take requires a thorough assessment of all impacts that can be \nexpected under either route. The discussion also highlights that criteria of essential use cannot not \novercome the need for assessing the impacts of possible regulatory decisions on harmful chemicals. \nFurthermore, while applying the concept of essential use may strengthen the inclusion of societal norms \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 90 \n\nand perspectives, its operationalisation largely depends on the specification of suitable criteria of \nessentiality or non-essentiality. Finally, assuming those criteria have been defined, regular and EU-wide \nupdates of societal preferences on essential uses are needed to ensure the objectivity and relevance of \nthe concept in the long-run. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 91 \n\n9 Key gaps in knowledge \n\nIn previous chapters the impacts of fluorinated polymers along their lifecycles have been evaluated mainly \nbased on data from literature. Fluorinated polymers may currently have important uses related to \nrenewable energy and increasing the durability and performance of products that create benefits for \nsociety. As illustrated in the report, however, the fluorinated polymer lifecycle also shows risks for the \nenvironment and human health, including some related to climate change impacts, which question their \noverall benefits. At this stage the information is rather limited on both the benefits and the risks, but the \nseverity of the potential impacts, including the immensely high GWP of fluorinated gases, warrants further \nstudies on lifecycle emissions. These would help to assess whether fluorinated polymers contribute or \nblock goals of a circular, toxic-free and low-carbon economy, and whether uses really can be considered \nessential. Reliable information is needed on flows, amounts, markets, exposures to human and the \nenvironment, replacement alternatives, and economic aspects related to different use areas for potential \naction on risk governance of fluorinated polymers at different stages. Knowledge gaps along the lifecycle \nhave been collated in Table 9.1. \n\nKey gaps in knowledge and regulations, and need for action were identified as follows. \n\n\u2022 Data streams on feedstock and intermediate chemicals at product or at least industry level in \nEurope, as well as for products imported into Europe. \n\n\u2022 Studies/research/monitoring on substances (feedstock, synthesis by-products, impurities and \ndegradation products) that are emitted from all types of activities along the lifecycle of fluorinated \npolymers (production, manufacturing of products, incineration/thermal degradation/wastewater \ntreatment, etc.). Key knowledge gaps are analyses of volatile fluorinated gases and oligomers. \n\n\u2022 Research on degradation pathways of these fluorinated substances, to assess to which extent \ndegradation products with high GWP are formed. Degradation during production, use, end-of-life \nand in the environment are relevant for such studies. \n\n\u2022 Studies to assess whether the GWP can be calculated based on the emissions along the lifecycle \nof a chemical and not only on the chemical itself, as it is done now. \n\n\u2022 More systematic studies on emissions of FTOHs and other PFAS from, for example, wastewater \ntreatment plants and manufacturing sites. \n\n\u2022 Research and demonstration of technologies to recycle fluorinated polymers from waste, both \nduring the production phases and from end-of-life products. Demonstrations would have to \nconsider how recycling is done in practice, including for wastes shipped outside Europe. \n\n\u2022 Systematic and in-depth analyses on benefits and risks associated with the use of fluorinated \npolymers in different applications. Potentially, tools and criteria, which currently are being \ndeveloped for ensuring safe and sustainable design, can be used in combination with a framework \nfor essential versus non-essential uses. Fluorinated polymers could serve as a test case for such \nstudies. \n\n\u2022 Research and development of alternatives for the replacement of fluorinated polymers in product \ndevelopment which do not use, produce or incidentally form substances of concern along their \nlifecycles. Safe and sustainable by design assessments could be applied to ensure that benefits \nand risks related to potential replacements are assessed. \n\n\u2022 Labelling of products containing fluorinated polymers, to enable safe waste management of endof-life products. \n\n\u2022 Awareness raising among various stakeholders, including product designers, for consideration of \nmaterial choices, authorities and enforcement bodies, and consumers. \n\n\u2022 Studies to assess to what extent current chemical risk management can consider lifecycle \nassessments, for multiple impacts across numerous policy domains, and whether updates of both \nchemicals, product, waste, environmental and F-gas regulations are needed to consider such \nsystemic impacts. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 92 \n\nTable 9.1.

Supplementary information on production of HF and environmental \nrisks in fluorspar extraction \n\nA1.1 From acid-grade fluorspar to hydrofluoric acid \n\nThe excavated ore, either from open pit or underground mines, are concentrated by flotation techniques. \nThe ore is grounded to fine particles, for example below 150 \u00b5m. The process is conducted in a series of \ncells that successively concentrates the ore from the feed material (CaF2 concentrations in the feed \ndepends on the deposit, in the literature examples of 30\u201340% are mentioned) to a minimum of 97.0% CaF2 \nin the final concentrate. The water in the final product is then removed in a thickener and a rotary drum \nfilter. Tailings generated from flotation (non-recovered ore material remaining) are usually disposed of in \ntailings ponds as an aqueous slurry. In the tailing ponds the settled water is recycled to the plant for reuse. \n(Fluorine Forum 2019; Kiptanui, 2015). \n\nAs mined, fluorspar ore contains host rock and other inert impurities, together with varying amounts of \nlead, silver or zinc ores. The minerals that are not wanted together with impurities including also \nunextracted fluorine end up in the tailings ponds. An example of flows processed per operating days at \nCavendish Mill (Fluorine Forum 2019) are: \n\n- typically 1 310 tonnes per day of polymetallic fluorspar ore containing 28% CaF2 is processed \n(impurities: 1.79% lead); \n\n- 250 tonnes of acid grade fluorspar concentrate are produced per day (together with 20 tonnes of \nlead, 40 tonnes of barytes and 300 tonnes of crushed stone aggregate are formed as by-products); \n\n- about 700 tonnes of tailings are generated per day containing 5% CaF2 in coarse fraction (250 \ntonnes/day) and 12% CaF2 in fine fraction (450 tonnes/day). \n\nAfter flotation, the acid grade fluorspar is transported to plants for the production of HF. In the process, \nthe fluorspar is reacted with sulphuric acid (H2SO4) in an endothermic process to form HF. The hot solid \ncalcium sulphate residues are removed and neutralised at the opposite end of the HF reactor. Gypsum is \nsold to the building industry for use as a floor-levelling material, building blocks and as a retarder in the \ncement industry. (BUSS ChemTech, n.d.; Eurofluor, n.d.) \n\nA1.2 Environmental and health impacts from extraction of fluorspar \u2013 examples \n\nSustainable sourcing is recognised as important in the EU in the manufacture of products starting from \nraw material extraction and it takes into account environmental and health concerns as well as social and \neconomic issues. Uncontrolled mining activities, such as small-scale unregualted mining and a lack of use \nof tools for protecting of health and safety, are also linked to the lack of environmental protection \nmeasures. Google Maps\u2019 images of Mongolia show dust deposition ranging several kilometres downwind \nof mining areas, and also evidence of large animal herds using tailings ponds as their main source of \ndrinking water (Baatar and Grayson, 2009; Grayson, 2009). \n\nA special health impact relates to the intake of drinking water with ahigh fluoride content from the ion \nexchange processes and the weathering of the rock. At mining sites, dust formation related to mining \nactivities (for example, spillage and tailings) increase the exposure of human and animals, although, in the \nliterature, this is only reported for coal rather than fluorspar mining. For example, in Mongolia fluoride \nconcentrations around 2 mg/l in drinking water (42) occur in concentrations which cause health problems \nsuch as dental fluorosis \u2013 in several areas near deposits about half of the children have dental fluorosis \u2013 \nand skeletal fluorosis, which is not curable. Elevated fluoride may also lead to intellectual deficits that can \nbe considerable (Grandjean, 2019; Grayson et al., 2016). \n\n \n42 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends for fluoride concentration in drinking water should not exceed 1.5 mg/l \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 115 \n\nA special concern also relates to the stability of tailings. A few acciditents involving leackage from tailings \nponds have been reported. In 1985, a tailings dam of the Prestavel fluorite mine, near Tesero (Trento) in \nnorthern Italy, failed, causing a disastrous mudflow involving 180,000 m3 of semi-fluid tailings which \nrapidly flowed over 4.2 km along the Stava Valley until it reached the river. In this catastrophe, 268 lives \nwere lost and 20 people injuried (Luino et al., 2012; Chandler et al., 1995). Another, tailings pond accident \nhappened 2007 at the Derby fluorine mine in UK where a failure in a tailings dam caused a release of 20 \n000 m3 tailings, slightly increasing concetrations in soil immediately beneath the tailings deposit (Anon. \n2007). \n\nThe host rock of fluorspar may contain impurities, such as lead, arscenic and zinc, that ends up in the \ntailings, along with non-extractive fluorine remains. Tailings are disposed in tailings pond; typically tailings \nare pumped as a slurry to huge tailings ponds from which leaks may occur into the surrounding \nenvironment. It is also possible that the tailings from fluorspar are acid generating (43) which affects the \naquatic ecosystem and produce contamination and even health effects on humans and livestock. It is \nimportant that ponds are covered when they are full to avoid risk of dust spreading into the environment. \n\nUnderground fluorite mining produces a relatively large volume of polluted water that need to be removed \nfrom the mines during the extraction operation. If these effluents are discharged into a water body \nuntreated, the water body may become polluted with heavy metals and fluoride. In Asturias situated in \nnorthwest Spain each year, for example, approximately 200 000 m3 of wastewater from a fluorspar mine \nis discharged into a nearby stream, which results in fluoride concentrations of up to 4.8 mg/l (Roque\u00f1\u00ed et \nal, 2005). \n\nThe faulty exploitation of some Chinese deposits that has caused some mine closures due to \nenvironmental concerns is mentioned in the SCRREEN report (Karhu et al., 2018), but without further \ndetails. \n\nThe following are examples of environmental and health impacts connected with heavy metal pollution \npresented in recent literature. \n\n\u2022 Spain: Forj\u00e1n et al. (2019) found that the former and current fluorspar mining on the northern \ncoast of Spain has resulted in increased levels of mercury in soils and sediments near the mine as \na result of the inappropriate disposal of processing waste. \n\n\u2022 Kenya: increased levels of fluoride have been found in animal meat and plants around a fluorspar \nmine in Kenya \u2013 the exposure was assumed to result from poorly treated wastewater from the \nmine (Kibet et al., 2019). Fluorite mining there has had major impacts on the physical environment \nwith changes in topography and vegetation cover. \n\n\u2022 Tunisia: an old fluorite (CaF2) and barite (BaSO4) mine is located in Hammam Zriba, northern \nTunisia. As a result of the wind erosion of the tailings and their subsequent wind transport, \nextreme concentrations were measured in soils near to the tailings dumps: 5% barium, 4% \nstrontium, 7% sulphur, 1% fluorine, 0.8 % zinc and 0.2% lead. Concentrations of the major \npollutants decrease with distance, but they were high even in the farthest samples, situated 2 km \ndownstream from the mining wastes dumping area (Djebbi et al., 2017). \n\n\u2022 Pakistan: Rashid et al. (2018) concluded that the groundwater in villages near a fluorspar mine was \nnot fit to drink. Of analysed groundwater samples, 62.2 % exceeded the WHO limit value of 1.5 \nmg/l for drinking water. The elevated concentrations, typically 1.5\u20133 mg/l, were due to the \nweathering of rock and ion exchange processes. \n\n \n43 Acid generation occur when sulphides in the tailings are oxides to sulphuric acid and there is a lack of neutralising minerals. Acid \n\nmining drainage (AMD) is produced when sulphide-bearing material is exposed to oxygen and water. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 116 \n\nAnnex 2.

A non-exhaustive list of of different international and European \nregulations on PFAS \n\nInternational and EU legislation provides a means of controlling PFAS pollution and protecting the \nenvironment and human health. Table A10 provides a (non-exhaustive) summary of different international \nand European legislation on PFAS. Since the detection of PFAS in human and environmental samples in the \n1970s, European Directives and Regulations have provided indirect protective measures by establishing \ngeneral rules for a range of PFAS, particularly PFOA and PFOS. These include the 1986 Sewage Sludge \nDirective (86/278/EEC); the 1998 Drinking Water Directive (DWD) (98/83/EC); the 2000 Water Framework \nDirective (WFD) (2000/60/EC); the 2004 Food Contact Materials Regulation (No. 1935/2004); the 2004 \nPersistent Organic Pollutants Regulation (No850/2004 in 2004); and the 2006 Groundwater Directive \n(2006/118/EC). \n\nFurthermore, the EU legislative restrictions, including amendments of previous frameworks as well as \nfuture strategies, specifically mention PFAS. The main legislative documents are the following. \n\n- In 2008, EC No 1272/2008 Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and \nmixtures (the CLP Regulation), the WFD (2008/98/EC) and Environmental Quality Standards \nDirective (EQSD) (2008/105/EC). \n\n- In 2010, the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) (Directive 2010/75/EU), covering the \nmanagement of the PFAS emissions from industrial sources. \n\n- In 2011, the Plastic Materials Regulation (No 10/2011). \n- In 2013, the Directive 2013/39/EU, which amended the WFD and the EQSD, provided harmonised \n\nguidelines for risk assessment and monitoring of priority substances. \n- In 2017, first REACH restriction on PFOA. \n\nTable A10. Overview of some of European Economic Area legislation covering PFAS. \n\nRegulation Description How PFAS are regulated \n\nEuropean Regulation (EC) No. \n1272/2008 on classification, \nlabelling and packaging of \nsubstances and mixtures (the CLP \nRegulation) \n\nThe CLP Regulation harmonises the \ncriteria for classification (CLH) of \nsubstances and mixtures, and the rules \nfor labelling and packaging of these \nhazardous substances and mixtures. The \nclassification of a substance can also \ndetermine how substances are covered \nunder other \u2018downstream\u2019 legislation.  \n\nA few PFAS (e.g. PFOA, PFDA, PFNA) \nare subject to harmonised \nclassification under the CLP.  \n\nThe Public Activities Coordination \nTool (PACT) \n\nProvides an overview of the substancespecific activities being undertaken by \nauthorities under the REACH Regulation \nand the CLP Regulation. \n\n21 different PFAS species are listed \non the PACT list.  \n\nCouncil Directive 98/24/EC on the \nprotection of the health and safety \nof workers from the risks related to \nchemical agents at work (the \nChemical Agents Directive (CAD)) \n\nOutlines the minimum requirements for \nthe protection of workers\u2019 health and \nsafety arising, or likely to arise, from the \neffects of chemical agents in the \nworkplace or the use of chemical agents \nat work. Indicative occupational \nexposure limit values (IOELVs) are set at \na European Economic Area (EEA) level.  \n\n10 individual PFAS are covered by \nthe CAD. \n\nPlant Protection Products \nRegulation (EC) No 1107/2009 \n\n Several PFAS (approximately 37) for \nactive substances in plant protection \nproducts for which the CLH process \nhas been finished or is still ongoing. \nThree of those 37 are listed as being \nactive substances in plant protection \nas well as biocidal products.  \n\nBiocidal Product Regulation (EU) No \n528/2012 and amendments \n\n 11 biocidal active substances \ncontain an aliphatic CF2- or CF3- unit \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 121 \n\nRegulation Description How PFAS are regulated \n\n(PFAS). Nine of these substances are \ncurrently approved as biocidal active \nsubstances and include the product \ntypes PT18 (insecticides), PT08 \n(wood preservatives), PT14 \n(rodenticides), PT07 (film \npreservatives), PT09 (fibre, leather, \nrubber and polymer preservatives) \nand PT10 (building material \npreservatives) and/or PT 21 \n(antifouling agents). \n\nDirective 2008/98/EC \n(the Waste Framework Directive) \n\nLays down the measures to prevent or \nreduce the adverse impacts of the \ngeneration and management of waste \nby reducing resource use and improving \nefficiency of use. The properties of \nwaste which render it hazardous are \noutlined in Annex III. \n\nSeveral PFAS (including PFHxS, PFBA, \nPFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA and PFBS) \nmeet the criteria for properties of \nwaste which render it hazardous \nunder Annex III of the WFD. \n\nDirective 2013/39/EEA as regards \npriority substances in the field of \nwater policy (the Water Framework \nDirective) \n\nSets environmental quality standards \n(EQS) for priority substances listed \nunder the WFD. \n\nPFOS and PFOA are listed as priority \nhazardous substances and have set \nEQS values. \n\nDirective 98/83/EC on the quality of \nwater intended for human \nconsumption (the Drinking Water \nDirective) \n\nEU Member States to set quality \nstandard values for the parameters that \nare set in Annex I, be that microbial or \nchemical. Regular monitoring is a \nrequirement of this Directive, as is \nremedial action. \n\n>70 individual PFAS species covered \nby the DWD. \n\n \n\nREACH: Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \n\nThe European chemicals legislation REACH includes two complementary regulatory instruments for \nmanaging the risks of hazardous chemicals: (a) authorisation, which is a formal approval to continue a \nspecific use of a substance being classified as an SVHC (45) for a defined period, and (b) restriction, which \nis the adoption of measures to reduce or eliminate the risks from production, manufacture and marketing \nof a substance at an European-wide level. An authorisation is initiated by companies, who can apply for \npermission to continue using an SVHC beyond a pre-defined end date. Restriction procedures can be \ninitiated by Member States\u2019 regulatory authorities or by the ECHA at the request of the EC and can be \napplied to any substance, including, but not necessarily, SVHCs. For both regulatory instruments the \nEuropean Commission takes the final decision on adopting risk management measures, based on the \nwritten opinions of the ECHA\u2019s RAC and SEAC. \n\nThe EU restricted the industrial manufacture and use of PFOS and then PFOA under the REACH Regulation \n(No 1907/2006, No 522/2009; Commission Regulation 2017/1000). On 4 July 2020, based on the SVHC \nCandidate List, restrictions on the use, import and production of PFOA, its salts and derivatives came into \neffect with thresholds specific to their applications (No 2019/1021, No 2020/784). \n\nThe SVHC Candidate List also includes other PFAS (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTDA) due \nto their vPvB or PBT properties. PFHxA and PFHxS, the latter used as alternative to PFOA, have been \nproposed as candidates for the list under the REACH restrictions. Two more PFAS were proposed for \neventual inclusion in the Restriction Annex XIV of REACH within the SVHC Candidate List: PFBS and 2,3,3,3- \ntetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propionic acid, its salts and acyl halides (HFPO-DA), which have been \nused as substitutes of PFOS and PFOA, respectively (ECHA, 2020; 2020b). Further safety measures to \n\n \n45 SVHCs are chemicals which are classified as one of the following (a) carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction; (b) \n\npersistent, bioaccumulative or toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB), (c) endocrine disrupters; or \nsubstances that (d) give \u201crise to an equivalent level of concern\u201d (EC 2006, Article 57). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 122 \n\nprotect from hazardous substances, including PFOA, PFNA, PFDA and APFO, have been established by the \nCLP Regulation (No 1272/2008) that aligns the European system of classification and labelling rules to the \nGlobally Harmonised System (GHS). \n\nOther REACH restrictions on PFAS include the following. \n\n\u2022 In October 2017 the German and Swedish authorities proposed restricting the manufacture, \nmarketing and use of perfluorocarboxylic acids with 9\u201314 carbon atoms (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, \nPFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTeDA). This regulatory procedure is completed and the restriction will \nenter into force in February 2023. \n\n\u2022 A restriction proposal for PFHxS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, C6) was submitted by the \nNorwegian authorities in April 2019 and was discussed in ECHA\u2019s RAC and SEAC. The final \nRAC/SEAC Opinion was published in autumn 2020. \n\n\u2022 In December 2019, a German proposal to regulate PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid, C6) was \nsubmitted and was discussed in the ECHA committees. \n\n\u2022 ECHA has registered an intention to submit a restriction 1 October 2021 for the use PFAS in firefighting foams. \n\nThe POPs Regulation EC 850/2004 \n\nThe EU has implemented the POPs Regulation (EC 850/2004, recast under Regulation EC 2019/1021) which \nacts to implement the provisions of the Stockholm Convention across EEA Member States. \n\nPFOS was originally included in the restricted substances list of REACH. However, since its addition to the \nStockholm Convention in 2009, it has been regulated under the POPs Regulation. PFOS, its salts and \nperfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride (PFOSF) are listed under Annex I of the POPs Regulation, specifying the \nfollowing exemptions for unintentional trace contaminants (UTCs): \n\ni. substances or preparations (<10 mg/kg); \nii. semi-finished products or articles, or parts (<0.1 % by weight calculated with reference to the mass \n\nof structurally or micro-structurally distinct parts that contain PFOS or, for textiles or other coated \nmaterials, if the amount of PFOS is lower than 1 \u03bcg/m2 of the coated material). \n\nPFAS in sector-specific legislations \n\nEU Industrial Emissions Directive \nThe Industrial Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU) regulates pollutant emissions from large \nindustrial installations in the EU, including emissions of PFAS from sites where they are produced or used. \nIndustrial activities which exceed production thresholds listed in the IED\u2019s Annex I must obtain a permit \nfrom the competent authorities in the relevant Member State. Sector 4 of Annex I covers the chemical \nindustry (46), including the facilities that are currently producing fluorochemicals and fluorinated polymers. \nReleases of PFAS to the environment can also occur during the manufacture of products in which PFAS are \nused. Some of these activities are also listed in the IED\u2019s Annex I: for example, the production of textiles, \npulp, paper and cardboard. \n\nThe permits are based on the best available techniques (BATs) described in BAT Reference Documents \n(BREFs). The Commission adopts the BAT conclusions as Implementing Decisions and Member States use \nthem as a reference to define the permit conditions. In particular, the BAT associated emission levels (BAT\n \n46 The parts of Annex I Sector 4 that are relevant for PFAS are: \n4.1 Production of organic chemicals such as\u2026 \n\n(f) halogenic hydrocarbons,\u2026 \n(h) plastic materials (polymers, synthetic fibres and cellulose-based fibres), \u2026 \n(k) surface-active agents and surfactants. \n\n4.4 Production of plant protection products or of biocides. \n4.5.

Annex II of the IED lists the polluting substances for which ELVs must be set in \nthe permits and it indirectly covers some PFAS (47). In addition, Article 14(1)a of the IED requires ELVs to \nbe set in permits \u201cfor other polluting substances, which are likely to be emitted from the installation \nconcerned in significant quantities, having regard to their nature and their potential to transfer pollution \nfrom one medium to another\u201d. \n\nWaste treatment facilities are covered by the IED and these can emit PFAS. The BAT conclusions for waste \ntreatment (48) address PFOA and PFOS, but not other PFAS. Permits are given to waste treatment plants \non condition that they implement the obligations within four years of the publication of a BAT conclusion. \nAuthorities can consider setting emissions limits for all other PFAS as well as for PFOS and PFOA. \n\nEU regulation on food-contact materials \nSeventeen categories of FCM exist and fluorinated polymers are relevant to at least food plastics, coatings, \npaper and board, waxes, inks and elastomers. Five of the 17 uses, including food plastics, have specific \nregulations. The 12 other materials are so-called non-harmonised materials. The EU Plastics Regulation on \nFood Contact Materials (EU 10/2011) is a positive list which covers monomers and polymer production \naids as well as migration from the final polymer article. This includes non-intentionally added substances \n(NIAS) at levels above the threshold of toxicological concern, which currently is set at 10 \u03bcg/kg food. These \nsubstances go through authorisation by the EFSA, based on hazard and risk criteria which are more than \n30 years old (Muncke et al. 2017). While CMR and persistent chemicals in general should be avoided in \nFCM, many are allowed due to old authorisations or if it can be shown to be likely, for example, by \nmigration modelling (Brandsch et al., 2015; Simoneau et al., 2011), that migration to food will not occur in \namounts of toxicological concern. Modelling can be applied if the assumptions are fulfilled, for instance, \nthat the substances in question are homogeneously distributed in the polymer, but in practice these \nassumptions may not be fulfilled. The FCM Regulation including the Framework Regulation (EC) No. \n1935/2004, the Good Manufacturing Practices Regulation (EC) No. 2023/2006, the Plastics Regulation (EU) \nNo. 10/2011 are currently being revised. Limit values related to either specific migration or total migration \nwill finally be set, or a limit of non-detectability is set \u2013 a default is currently defined as 10 \u00b5g/kg food. \n\nExamples of fluorinated polymers used in FCMs are metal coatings for non-stick pans, and baking and \nkitchen utensils used by consumers or in industrial food production. Fluorinated elastomers are typically \nused in tubing, membranes, baking trays and conveyor belts in industrial food production. Per- and \npolyfluorinated polyether polymers, according to the ECHA definition, are used in oil pumps and as \nlubricants in food production facilities. They, and fluorinated side-chain polymers, are also used as coatings \nand sizing agents in paper and board single-use food packaging and as food kitchen utensils such as bowls \n(Lohman et al., 2020; Dimzon et al., 2015; Trier et al., 2018; Trier et al. 2011, K\u00e4rrman et al., 2019). \n\nEU Regulation on cosmetics \nRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products lays out the rules that cosmetic products must comply \nwith if they are to be made available on the market. Annex II lists the substances that are prohibited for \nuse in cosmetics; PFOS and PFOA and their salts are prohibited, although they are found as impurities in \nsome products. All prohibited substances are included in Annex II of the Cosmetics Regulation: \nCosing_Annex II_v2 (49). \n\nDetergents \nDetergents are typically intentional mixtures of surfactants, consisting of a hydrophic (water repellent) tail \nand a hydrophilic (water soluble) polar head. These detergent mixtures are made up of so-called \nhomologue series which vary in the lengths of their hydrophobic tails. When the hydrophobic tail are \nchains of (monomer) repeat units, they qualify as polymers and are exempted from REACH (Krafft and \n\n \n47 Annex I includes PFAS identified as CMRs and PBTs. \n48 Commission Implementing Decision 2018/1147 of 10 August 2018. \n49 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/cosing/pdf/COSING_Annex%20II_v2.pdf \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 124 \n\nRiess, 2015). The Regulation on Detergents (EU 648/2004) and its amendments set requirements and \ndescribe methods to test detergents\u2019 ability to biodegrade initially (primary degradation) and ultimately \n(also called mineralisation). Since 2012, the Regulation also limits the content of phosphates, a nutrient \naffecting water systems, but the regulation neither assesses other impacts on human or environmental \nhealth, nor impacts along a detergent\u2019s lifecycle. \n\nFluorinated detergents/cleaning agents may be used as graffiti removers, and PFPEs have been used as \nspreading/wetting agents in floor detergents and waxes (Gl\u00fcge et al., 2020). \n\nEuropean-Pollutant Release and Transfer Register \nThe European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) (50) makes emission data reported by \nMember States on major industrial activities publicly accessible. It covers emissions from the activities \ndefined in Annex I of the E-PRTR Regulation (51), which largely equates to Annex I of the IED. Some of these \nactivities are sources of PFAS related to fluorinated polymers, for example, in the chemical industry, \nsurface treatment of metals, waste and waste water management, and the production of textiles and \nleather. \n\nEU Regulations on waste \nWaste are classified as hazardous or non-hazardous (52). The waste classification has several implications. \nThere are numerous EU Regulations setting special requirements for waste defined as hazardous, for \nexample, the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) requires permits for the export/import of hazardous \nwaste both within EU and between EU and OECD countries beyond the EU. Waste classified as hazardous \ncan only be disposed of in hazardous waste landfills meeting the acceptance criteria. Furthermore, the IED \nand the Environmental and Impact Assessment Directive concern the management of hazardous waste. \n\nF-gas Regulation \nThere is a specific regulation on fluorinated GHGs (EU) No 517/2014). Since the mid-1990s ODS have been \nsubstituted by certain F-gases, in particular HFCs. Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014 aims to reduce 2030 \nindustrial emissions by 70% compared to 1990. This reduction is to be realised by three means. \n\n1. The gradual phase-down of the quantities of HFCs used by means of quotas. The phase-down only \napplies to HFCs and not to perfluorocarbons (PFCs) or SF6. \n\n2. Prohibitions on use and placement on the market of F-gases, insofar as is technically feasible and \nmore climate-friendly alternatives are available. \n\n3. Continuation and expansion of the scope of regulations concerning leak tests, certification, \ndisposal and labelling. \n\nAnnex I Section I of the F-gas Regulation lists a number of HFCs, whereas Section 2 lists a number of PFCs \nthat may overlap with the current restriction proposal under development. \n\nSpecifically, HFC-23 is a known by-product from fluoropolymer production (HCFC-22), as also described in \nChapter 4. Twenty-seven fluorinated ethers and one perfluorinated polyether are also listed as GHGs \nwhich potentially could be used or formed during the lifecycle of fluorinated ether polymers, such as the \nPFPEs. \n\nChemicals Strategy for Sustainability \nTaking a forward-looking perspective, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability towards toxic-free \nenvironments under the European Green Deal pays special attention to PFAS, considering numerous cases \n\n \n50 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/industry/stationary/eper/legislation.htm \n    https://prtr.eea.europa.eu/#/home \n51 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1583400375088&uri=CELEX:32006R0166 \n52 Hazardous waste is a waste that due to its (intrinsic) chemical or other properties poses a risk to the environment and/or human \n\nhealth. The classification is primarily based on the European List of Waste (2014/955/EU) or on its hazardous properties. The \nEuropean Commission Regulations Nos. 1357/2014 and 2017/997 define the properties for hazardous waste classification \nreferring to assessment methods developed in CLP. \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=LEGISSUM:l32025\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 125 \n\nof environmental contamination (COM(2020) 667 final). Therefore, the strategy adopted a PFAS group \napproach under relevant legislation for water as well as banning them in fire-fighting foams and other nonessential uses. Further aims include enhanced policy dialogues and international forums, support for the \ndevelopment of innovative remediation methodologies and safe PFAS substitutes. \n\nGLOBAL LEGISLATION AND MAJOR LEGISLATION OUTSIDE EUROPE \n\nhis section covers the most relevant global-scale legislation on PFAS. \n\nStockholm Convention and Persistant Organic Pollutants Regulation \n\nThe Stockholm Convention on Persistant Organic Pollutants is an international treaty that aims to \neliminate or restrict the production and use of these substances in order to protect human health and the \nenvironment. \n\nThe POP Regulation (EC 2019/1021) transfers the resolutions of the Stockholm Convention into EU \nmeasures/law. \n\nCurrently, the most horizontal and widest legally-binding PFAS regulations of are in the Stockholm \nConvention. At global level, the Convention imposed restrictions (Annex B) on the use of PFOS (53), its salts \nand PFOSF in specific products (Decision SC-4/17) in 2009, and in 2019 included PFOA (54), its salts and \nrelated compounds for elimination from specific uses (IISD, 2019). After being placed on the POPs list in \n2009, there was an increase in the number of countries that put legal and administrative measures in place \nto control PFOS production, import, export and use. Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid(PFHxS), its salts and \nrelated compounds have been proposed for listing in the Annex A of the Convention without specific \nexemptions (Stockholm Convention, 2019). Potential toxicity of PFAS precursors has also been highlighted \nby the OECD (OECD, 2007). \n\nMontreal protocol \n\nThe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is the landmark multilateral \nenvironmental agreement transferred in Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 that regulates nearly 100 manmade chemicals referred to as ODS. The protocol regulates production, import, export, placing on the \nmarket, use, recovery, recycling, reclamation and destruction of ODS. Adopted on 15 September 1987, the \nProtocol is to date the only UN treaty that has been ratified by all UN Member States. \n\nPredominantly CFCs and HCFCs are covered by the Montreal Protocol, ranging from C1-C3 as core, partly \nor fully halogenated. HCFCs are gases used worldwide in refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam \napplications, but they are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. They are both ODS and powerful \nGHGs: the most commonly used HCFC is nearly 2,000 times more potent than CO2 in terms of its GWP. \n\nThe quantitative limits and allocating quotas for substances controlled under EC Regulation No 1005/2009 \nare updated yearly by means of a decision which lists the amounts, the addressees and the quota per \ngroup of companies. The latest ones are Decisions (EU) Nos. 2019/2079 and 2018/2029. A number of \nsubstances that are used as process agents are derogated from the restrictions. Thus, substances such as \nchlorofluorocarbon 113 (CFC113) and HCFC22, which are used as intermediates in the production of \nfluoropolymers, are not phased out. \n\n \n53  The Stockholm Convention covers PFOS, salts and PFOSF. In the EU POPs Regulation, the definition of the scope is \n\n\"Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives (PFOS) C8F17SO2X (X = OH, metal salt (O-M+), halide, amide, and other \nderivatives including polymers)\". \n\n54 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/784 of 8 April 2020 amending Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. \n\nhttps://www.unenvironment.org/ozonaction/what-we-do/refrigeration-and-air-conditioning\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 126 \n\nThe Montreal Protocol also makes important contributions to the realisation of the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. \n\nOverall, the Montreal Protocol phased out the use of ozone-depleting CFCs except for certain essential \nuses, and also defined the concept of essential use in Decision IV/25 (55). As a result, the Montreal \nProtocol's concept of essential use has been put forward as an approach for reducing exposure to PFAS by \nphasing out all non-essential uses. \n\nUnited States \n\nUntil very recently, PFAS have been largely unregulated at the federal level. Several US states have, \nhowever, set their own drinking-water guideline levels for PFOA and PFOS (56). The Interstate Technology \nand Regulatory Council (ITRC) indicated the significant variation in PFAS regulations by identifying the \nstates that have different guideline for PFOA and/or PFOS levels in drinking- and groundwater from US \nEPA\u2019s health advisories (HAs) (57). From 2006 to 2015, the US EPA worked with eight major chemical \nmanufacturers to voluntarily phase out production and use of so-called long-chain PFAS and their \nprecursors (PFOA Stewardship Program) (U.S. EPA 2020a). The eight companies participating in the PFOA \nStewardship Program met its goals (58; 59) At the federal level, the US EPA set a non-enforceable lifetime \nHA level for PFOA and PFOS, individually or combined, of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water in \n2016, (US EPA 2020b). This lifetime HA is based on the latest information on health effects for cancer and \nother diseases. The HA is not a legally enforceable federal standard and is subject to change as new \ninformation becomes available. That action was criticised for having no enforcement mechanism, for only \naddressing two compounds and for promulgating a maximum PFAS concentration that does not \nadequately protect human health. Some states have decided to set lower advisory levels while others have \nimplemented enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) at the state level for specific PFAS \nchemicals. \n\nIn 2019, US EPA released its National PFAS Action Plan to provide both short-term solutions and long-term \nstrategies to address this important issue. This Plan is designed to support the Safe Drinking Water Act \n(SDWA), which addresses PFAS in drinking water. In addition, the PFAS Action Act of 2019 requires the US \nEPA to establish destruction and disposal guidance for a range of materials, including landfill leachate, \nbiosolids, and \u201csolid, liquid, or gas waste streams\u201d from facilities that manufacture or use PFAS (60). The \nlegislation requires that, over a five-year period, the US EPA reviews all other PFAS chemicals and decides \nwhether to list them under Superfund. This is designed to investigate and clean-up sites contaminated \nwith hazardous substances (61). \n\nIn February 2020, the US EPA proposed regulating PFOA and PFOS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In \nJune 2020, a PFAS Significant New Use rule (SNUR) issued under Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) came \ninto force affecting the importation of PFAS. \n\n \n55 United Nations, Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Montreal, Canada, 1987 \n56  Abunada, Z., Alazaiza, M.Y. and Bashir, M.J. 2020. \u2018An Overview of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the \n\nEnvironment: Source, Fate, Risk and Regulations\u2019.

The \nidea behind the P-sufficient approach is that the persistence of PFAS is a sufficient basis to warrant \nregulation regardless of other hazard traits such as the chemicals\u2019 bioaccumulation potential or toxicity. \n\nCanada \n\nCanada has implemented a combination of regulatory and voluntary actions to reduce the risks from \ncertain PFAS. The Canadian Government has been involved in developing regulations and guidance for \ncertain PFAS since the early 2000s. Several federal departments are involved in different aspects of this \nwork. Significant PFAS work is carried out under the Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan (FCSAP) which \nis largely related to the PFAS resulting from aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) use. The FCSAP program \ndevelops guidelines and guidance to assess and manage federal PFAS-contaminated sites. \n\nThe Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) is another program with significant involvement in the assessment \nand management of certain PFAS. The CMP has an environmental monitoring and surveillance program \nfor air, water, sediment and biota that provides data on certain PFAS to support risk assessment and risk \nmanagement tools. \n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Health Canada (HC) are jointly responsible for \nassessing chemical substances in Canada to determine their risks to the environment and human health, \nand develop risk management instruments to address the identified risks, including through regulation. \nHealth Canada recently published maximum acceptable concentrations (MACs) for PFOS (63) and PFOA (64) \nas well as drinking water screening values (DWSV) for other PFAS. \n\nIn 2006, Canada launched their Action Plan for the Assessment and Management of Perfluorinated \nCarboxylic Acids and their Precursors. For their regulatory approaches, Canada has prohibited the \nmanufacture, importation, use, sale, and offer for sale (65) of four fluorotelomer-based substances and \nPFOS with some exemptions. \n\nIn 2008, the Government of Canada published regulations for PFOS and its salts that prohibit the \nmanufacture, importation, sale, offer for sale and use of PFOS or products containing PFOS. At the time, \nthere were some exemptions for their continued use by selected sectors at reduced concentrations.

These regulations are under review with the objective of removing or further limiting \nexemptions for specific uses. \n\nIn 2018, the Canadian Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water and the FederalProvincial-Territorial Committee on Health and the Environment released a technical guideline document, \nwhich reviewed and assessed all identified health risks associated with PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. \nIt incorporated available studies and approaches and took into consideration the availability of appropriate \ntreatment technology. Based on the review, the drinking water guideline for PFOS and PFOA was set at a \nMAC of 0.6 \u00b5g/l (600 ppt) and 0.2 \u00b5g/l (200 ppt) based on the general population. \n\nIn June 2019 Transport Canada allowed airports to use PFAS-free firefighting foam, which shows a more \nprecautionary approach as it targets the whole class of PFAS. \n\nCanadian federal guidelines or screening values to protect human health are now available for 11 PFAS, \nwhile values to protect ecological receptors are available for PFOS. \n\nAustralia \n\nPFAS are not manufactured in Australia. The country\u2019s approach to risk reduction is a combination of \nregulatory, policy and voluntary approaches focused on reducing the importation and use of some PFAS, \nsuch as long-chain non-polymer PFAS, and on preventing and responding to PFAS contamination \nconsistently, using best practice. \n\nThe PFAS National Environmental Management Plan (NEMP), January 2020, from the National Chemicals \nWorking Group of the Heads of EPAs Australia and New Zealand (HEPA) and Australia\u2019s Department of the \nEnvironment and Energy (DoEE), provides nationally agreed guidance on the management of PFAS \ncontamination in the environment. The NEMP is an appendix to the Intergovernmental Agreement on a \nNational Framework Responding to PFAS Contamination and is designed to achieve a clear, effective \ncoherent and nationally consistent approach to the environmental regulation of PFAS. \n\nThe NEMP reflects the current state of knowledge and is updated regularly to provide an evidence-based \napproach that will be adapted to reflect increasing scientific knowledge relevant to environmental \nregulation of PFAS. The plan mainly provides guidance about PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and their direct and \nindirect precursors, as these are the most widely studied and recognise them as primary indicators of a \nbroad range of PFAS, including short-chain and other long-chain PFCA and PFSA. \n\nAustralia will continue to participate in the Stockholm Convention\u2019s processes and to address any domestic \nimplementation requirements that may result if PFHxS or other PFAS are listed.

In countries such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, PFAS are essentially unregulated \nand not monitored. Japan has taken measures to regulate PFOA, PFHxA, PFHxS and PFOS in manufacturing \nwith no maximum levels for any PFAS set for drinking water water in the country. Additionally, PFOS and \nits salts are listed in Class I Specified Chemical Substances under the Chemical Substances Control Law \n(CSCL). \n\nIn 2008, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in China released Substances listed under the \nHigh Pollution, High Environmental risk Product Catalogue, which includes high temperature melting \nmembrane fluorine resin coating used on non-stick cookware, kitchenware and food processing \nmachinery, based on the potential residual PFOA in the products to establish financial and environmental \nprotection priorities. \n\nIn 2011, the National Development and Reform Commission in China issued an Industrial Reconstructing \nGuide Directory Restriction on the production of PFOS and PFOA and support for research and \ndevelopment on alternatives to these substances. In 2014, the MEP issued Announcement No.[2014]21, \nbanning production, transportation, application, imports and exports of PFOS, its salts and PFOSF, except \nfor specific exemptions and acceptable uses. \n\nSince 2013, South Korea addressed PFOS, its salts and PFOSF as restricted substances under the Persistent \nOrganic Pollutants Control Act. Under the Act, any manufacture, import, export and use of PFOS, its salts \nand PFOSF are restricted except for specific exemptions and acceptable uses defined in the Stockholm \nConvention. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 130 \n\nAnnex 4.

New and legacy chemicals continue to be released into Europe\u2019s environment, adding to the total chemical burden on Europe\u2019s citizens and ecosystems. Early identification of emerging risks is one of the activities of the European Environment Agency (EEA). This briefing summarises the known and potential risks to human health and the environment in Europe posed by a group of very persistent chemicals, the per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS).\nPFAS are a group of more than 4 700 man-made chemicals (OECD, 2018), the two most well-known of which are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (Box 1). PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique chemical and physical properties, including oil and water repellence, temperature and chemical resistance, and surfactant properties. PFAS have been used in firefighting foams, non-stick metal coatings for frying pans, paper food packaging, creams and cosmetics, textiles for furniture and outdoor clothing, paints and photography, chrome plating, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Very limited information is available regarding which specific PFAS are used in which applications and at what levels in Europe.\nPFAS are a group of organic chemicals that contain a stable (unreactive) fluoro-carbon segment. Polyfluorinated PFAS contain both fluoro-carbon and hydro-carbon segments where the non-fluorinated part can degrade and ultimately form perfluorinated PFAS acids, such as PFOA and PFOS. While the long-chain PFAS accumulate in humans, animals and sediment/soil, the short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment (German EPA, 2017, 2018) due to their persistency and high mobility in air and water. The OECD provides further information on groups of PFAS.\nPFAS either are, or degrade to, persistent chemicals that accumulate in humans, animals and the environment. This adds to the total burden of chemicals to which people are exposed (Evans et al., 2016) and increases the risk of health impacts. Of the relatively few well-studied PFAS, most are considered moderately to highly toxic, particularly for children\u2019s development. Figure 1 summarises current knowledge of the health impacts of PFAS.\nSources: US National Toxicology Program, (2016); C8 Health Project Reports, (2012); WHO IARC, (2017); Barry et al., (2013); Fenton et al., (2009); and White et al., (2011).\nPeople most at risk of adverse health impacts are those exposed to high levels of PFAS, and vulnerable population groups such as children and the elderly. Fewer studies have investigated effects on biota (Land et al., 2018). Throughout life, people and animals accumulate PFAS in their bodies. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated the multiple lines of evidence of PFOA and PFOS toxicities, which resulted in significantly lower provisional \u2018safe\u2019 limits, known as the \u2018tolerable weekly intake\u2019 (TWI) (EFSA, 2018). The assessment concluded that a considerable proportion of the European population is expected to exceed the TWI due to intake of PFAS from food and drinking water.\nCosts to society arising from PFAS exposure are high, with the annual health-related costs estimated to be EUR 52-84 billion across Europe in a recent study (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019). The study notes that these costs are likely underestimated, as only a limited range of health effects (high cholesterol, decreased immune system and cancer) linked to exposure to a few specific PFAS were included in the estimates. In addition, PFAS pollution also affects ecosystems and generates costs through the need for remediation of polluted soil and water. Such costs are currently difficult to assess since information on the number and scale of sites contaminated with PFAS in Europe and on how PFAS impact ecosystems is lacking.\nPFAS are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and organisms (Valsecchi et al., 2013) across Europe, and have been detected in air, soil, plants and biota (Houde et al., 2006). Areas around industrial production, manufacturing and application sites have been found to be particularly contaminated by PFAS. This has led to contaminated drinking water around factories in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, and around airports and military bases in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom (IPEN, 2018; Hu et al., 2016). The total number of sites potentially emitting PFAS is estimated to be in the order of 100 000 in Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019).\nGenerally, regulated PFAS have been substituted with other short-chain and polymeric PFAS. Regrettably, several of these \u2018novel\u2019 PFAS and their short chain degradation products are also persistent. In particular, short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment and have been found to contaminate surface, ground- and drinking water (Eschauzier et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016; Gebbink et al., 2017), and accumulate in plants (Ghisi et al., 2019), which may lead to increases in human dietary exposure.\nNovel PFAS are increasingly detected (Xiao, 2017) in European surface waters. PFAS water pollution has been identified in countries across Europe, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as outside the EU. Several PFAS are sufficiently volatile to be considered long-range transboundary air pollutants, implying that emissions outside Europe are transported into Europe where they may accumulate in cold areas such as the Arctic (EEA, 2017). The well-known and regularly monitored PFAS (mainly perfluorinated acids) account only for a fraction of the chemical burden from PFAS present in human blood, the environment and wildlife (Koch et al., 2019).\nWhile both well-known and novel PFAS have been detected in drinking water in non-EU countries (Xiao, 2017; Kabor\u00e9 et al., 2018; Dauchy, 2019), at present there is little monitoring data available in the EU for drinking water. A case study by the World Health Organization (WHO) documents the story of PFAS contamination of the drinking water of 21 municipalities in the Veneto region of Italy. Industrial activity in the area had polluted both surface waters and ground water, as well as the drinking water of approximately 127 000 citizens (WHO, 2017). Monitoring conducted by the authorities of the Veneto Region found PFOS in 63-100 % of the locations sampled and PFOA in 100 % of the sites.\nFor comparison, the European Commission proposed a limit value of 0.1 \u00b5g/L for each individual PFAS in the 2018 recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive. This draft limit value was exceeded by a factor of 130 for PFOS and 66 for PFOA in samples taken in the Veneto Region.\nPFOS and their derivatives are included as a priority hazardous substance under the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2013), with a much lower Environmental Quality Standard (AA-EQS) limit value of 0.65 ng/L (0.00065 \u00b5g/L) in inland surface waters and 0.13 ng/L in seawater. Member States are due to report on compliance with the PFOS EQS by 2021. Samples taken in 2013 in Northern Europe exceeded this EQS in 27 % of river sites and 94 % of Baltic Sea and Kattegat seawater (Nguyen et al., 2017).\nThe main exposure pathways for human and environmental exposures are shown in Figure 2. For the general population, PFAS sources include drinking water, food, consumer products and dust (EFSA, 2018). In food, fish species at the top of the food chain and shellfish are significant sources of PFAS exposure. Livestock raised on contaminated land can accumulate PFAS in their meat, milk and eggs (Ingelido et al., 2018; Numata et al., 2014). Direct exposure may also come via skin creams and cosmetics (Danish EPA, 2018; Schultes et al., 2018) or via air from sprays and dust from PFAS-coated textiles. There is little knowledge on uptake via skin and the lungs, which can be severely affected by PFAS (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 2010; S\u00f8rli et al., 2020). Consumer exposure may also occur via other routes such as via floor, wood, stone, and car polishing and cleaning products. Groups that may be exposed to high concentrations of PFAS include workers and people eating or drinking water and foods contaminated via PFAS treated food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019). Though PFAS are used in drugs and medical equipment, there is little information on exposure via these routes.\nPFAS are transferred in the womb from mother to child and unless exposure decreases with age, the PFAS body burden increases due to bioaccumulation (Koponen et al., 2018). Evidence of internal PFAS exposure in humans is available from several national human biomonitoring studies conducted inside and outside Europe. Men generally have higher PFAS body burdens and serum levels (Ingelido et al., 2018) because they excrete fewer PFAS. For the most regulated PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS, consistent declines have been observed over the past 10-20 years in Europe (e.g. in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden). This decrease in levels in humans is likely to result from reduced exposure as a result of regulatory and non-regulatory action on consumer products, such as food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019) and textiles (Greenpeace, 2017).\nDespite the decreases in long-chain PFAS levels in human blood, concentrations of PFOA and PFOS measured in human blood still exceed the EFSA benchmark dose levels (known as BMDL5). This is particularly true for children and highly exposed sections of the European population (Buekers et al., 2018). The BMDL5 reflect the concentration in blood at which critical effects occur (cholesterol effects for adults and immune-toxicity for children) and are the basis for the provisional TWIs for PFOA and PFOS (EFSA, 2018).\nThe above mentioned human biomonitoring study in the Veneto Region investigated human exposure to PFOA and PFOS in the period 2015-2016 among 257 Italian residents of contaminated areas and 250 residents of background areas (Ingelido et al., 2018). The PFOA blood concentrations of residents of contaminated areas were 9-64 times higher than those of the background population. For PFOS, the levels were 1.4-1.6 times higher. Levels of PFOA in the highly exposed population were 0.2 to 26 times greater than the EFSA BDML5, while for PFOS, the figure was 0.3-1.3 times. EU research projects, such as Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) (Box 2), are currently working to produce a representative picture of PFAS exposure for the European population, as well as investigating links between exposure and health effects.\nIt is difficult for citizens to totally avoid exposure to PFAS. Using PFAS-free personal care products and cooking materials and avoiding direct contact with PFAS-containing products helps to reduce exposure. Decreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS. General and specific guidance to consumers and business on how to find PFAS-free alternatives is provided by consumer organisations and some national institutions (see Danish EPA, German EPA and Swedish KEMI).\nDecreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS\n\u00a9 Engin_Akyurt / Pixabay\nMeasures to reduce PFAS pollution are in place, mainly addressing well-known PFAS substances and their precursors. PFOS and PFOA are listed under Annex A of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), implying that parties to the Convention should \u2018eliminate the production and use\u2019 of the chemicals.\nAt EU level, PFOS is restricted under the EU POPs Regulation (EU, 2019). PFOA and its precursors are currently restricted under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (EU, 2006), including their presence in products made or imported into the EU. This will soon be replaced by a new restriction under the POPs Regulation, which will have more limited derogations, following a decision taken at the Stockholm Convention.\nA number of other PFAS are on the REACH list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs). In June 2019, GenX (a short-chain PFAS substitute for PFOA in fluoropolymer production) was the first chemical added to the SVHC list on the basis of its persistent, mobile and toxic properties posing a threat to drinking water and the environment. Several PFAS are on the Community Rolling Action Plan for evaluation over the coming years. As mentioned above, PFOA and PFOS are priority hazardous substances under the Water Framework Directive (EC, 2017; EU, 2000).\nAcross Europe, several countries have been active in monitoring PFAS in environmental media as well as in humans and products. Some countries have set national limit values for water and soil (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), for textiles (Norway) and for food contact materials (Denmark). Several EU Member States have set drinking water limits for specific PFAS and for groups of PFAS (Dauchy, 2019). In June 2019, Denmark announced a ban on PFAS-treated food contact materials, to enter into force in 2020.\nWith more than 4 700 known PFAS, undertaking substance-by-substance risk assessments and comprehensive environmental monitoring to understand exposure would be an extremely lengthy and resource-intensive process. As a result, complementary and precautionary approaches to managing PFAS are being explored.\nThis includes the regulation of PFAS as a class, or as subgroups, based on toxicity or chemical similarities. The proposal to establish a new \u2018group limit\u2019 value for PFAS of 0.5 \u00b5g/L, in addition to limits for 16 individual PFAS of 0.1 \u00b5g/L in drinking water under the recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive is currently under consideration at EU level. Such measures can be supported by cost-effective and targeted monitoring of PFAS in the environment to provide early warning signals of pollution.\nIn June 2019, the European Council of Ministers (EC, 2019) highlighted the widespread occurrence of PFAS in the environment, products and people, and called for an action plan to eliminate all non-essential uses of PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019).\nThe move towards zero pollution requires that product life cycles are made safer from the start (Warner and Ludwig, 2016), based on the concept of safe-and-circular-by-design (van der Waals et al., 2019). This approach offers opportunities to protect the health of Europe\u2019s citizens and environment at the same time as driving innovation for safer chemicals.\nKissa, E., 2001, \u2018Fluorinated Surfactants and Repellents: Second Edition, Revised and Expanded Surfactant Science Series.

New and legacy chemicals continue to be released into Europe\u2019s environment, adding to the total chemical burden on Europe\u2019s citizens and ecosystems. Early identification of emerging risks is one of the activities of the European Environment Agency (EEA). This briefing summarises the known and potential risks to human health and the environment in Europe posed by a group of very persistent chemicals, the per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS).\nPFAS are a group of more than 4 700 man-made chemicals (OECD, 2018), the two most well-known of which are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (Box 1). PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique chemical and physical properties, including oil and water repellence, temperature and chemical resistance, and surfactant properties. PFAS have been used in firefighting foams, non-stick metal coatings for frying pans, paper food packaging, creams and cosmetics, textiles for furniture and outdoor clothing, paints and photography, chrome plating, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Very limited information is available regarding which specific PFAS are used in which applications and at what levels in Europe.\nPFAS are a group of organic chemicals that contain a stable (unreactive) fluoro-carbon segment. Polyfluorinated PFAS contain both fluoro-carbon and hydro-carbon segments where the non-fluorinated part can degrade and ultimately form perfluorinated PFAS acids, such as PFOA and PFOS. While the long-chain PFAS accumulate in humans, animals and sediment/soil, the short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment (German EPA, 2017, 2018) due to their persistency and high mobility in air and water. The OECD provides further information on groups of PFAS.\nPFAS either are, or degrade to, persistent chemicals that accumulate in humans, animals and the environment. This adds to the total burden of chemicals to which people are exposed (Evans et al., 2016) and increases the risk of health impacts. Of the relatively few well-studied PFAS, most are considered moderately to highly toxic, particularly for children\u2019s development. Figure 1 summarises current knowledge of the health impacts of PFAS.\nSources: US National Toxicology Program, (2016); C8 Health Project Reports, (2012); WHO IARC, (2017); Barry et al., (2013); Fenton et al., (2009); and White et al., (2011).\nPeople most at risk of adverse health impacts are those exposed to high levels of PFAS, and vulnerable population groups such as children and the elderly. Fewer studies have investigated effects on biota (Land et al., 2018). Throughout life, people and animals accumulate PFAS in their bodies. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated the multiple lines of evidence of PFOA and PFOS toxicities, which resulted in significantly lower provisional \u2018safe\u2019 limits, known as the \u2018tolerable weekly intake\u2019 (TWI) (EFSA, 2018). The assessment concluded that a considerable proportion of the European population is expected to exceed the TWI due to intake of PFAS from food and drinking water.\nCosts to society arising from PFAS exposure are high, with the annual health-related costs estimated to be EUR 52-84 billion across Europe in a recent study (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019). The study notes that these costs are likely underestimated, as only a limited range of health effects (high cholesterol, decreased immune system and cancer) linked to exposure to a few specific PFAS were included in the estimates. In addition, PFAS pollution also affects ecosystems and generates costs through the need for remediation of polluted soil and water. Such costs are currently difficult to assess since information on the number and scale of sites contaminated with PFAS in Europe and on how PFAS impact ecosystems is lacking.\nPFAS are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and organisms (Valsecchi et al., 2013) across Europe, and have been detected in air, soil, plants and biota (Houde et al., 2006). Areas around industrial production, manufacturing and application sites have been found to be particularly contaminated by PFAS. This has led to contaminated drinking water around factories in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, and around airports and military bases in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom (IPEN, 2018; Hu et al., 2016). The total number of sites potentially emitting PFAS is estimated to be in the order of 100 000 in Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019).\nGenerally, regulated PFAS have been substituted with other short-chain and polymeric PFAS. Regrettably, several of these \u2018novel\u2019 PFAS and their short chain degradation products are also persistent. In particular, short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment and have been found to contaminate surface, ground- and drinking water (Eschauzier et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016; Gebbink et al., 2017), and accumulate in plants (Ghisi et al., 2019), which may lead to increases in human dietary exposure.\nNovel PFAS are increasingly detected (Xiao, 2017) in European surface waters. PFAS water pollution has been identified in countries across Europe, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as outside the EU. Several PFAS are sufficiently volatile to be considered long-range transboundary air pollutants, implying that emissions outside Europe are transported into Europe where they may accumulate in cold areas such as the Arctic (EEA, 2017). The well-known and regularly monitored PFAS (mainly perfluorinated acids) account only for a fraction of the chemical burden from PFAS present in human blood, the environment and wildlife (Koch et al., 2019).\nWhile both well-known and novel PFAS have been detected in drinking water in non-EU countries (Xiao, 2017; Kabor\u00e9 et al., 2018; Dauchy, 2019), at present there is little monitoring data available in the EU for drinking water. A case study by the World Health Organization (WHO) documents the story of PFAS contamination of the drinking water of 21 municipalities in the Veneto region of Italy. Industrial activity in the area had polluted both surface waters and ground water, as well as the drinking water of approximately 127 000 citizens (WHO, 2017). Monitoring conducted by the authorities of the Veneto Region found PFOS in 63-100 % of the locations sampled and PFOA in 100 % of the sites.\nFor comparison, the European Commission proposed a limit value of 0.1 \u00b5g/L for each individual PFAS in the 2018 recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive. This draft limit value was exceeded by a factor of 130 for PFOS and 66 for PFOA in samples taken in the Veneto Region.\nPFOS and their derivatives are included as a priority hazardous substance under the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2013), with a much lower Environmental Quality Standard (AA-EQS) limit value of 0.65 ng/L (0.00065 \u00b5g/L) in inland surface waters and 0.13 ng/L in seawater. Member States are due to report on compliance with the PFOS EQS by 2021. Samples taken in 2013 in Northern Europe exceeded this EQS in 27 % of river sites and 94 % of Baltic Sea and Kattegat seawater (Nguyen et al., 2017).\nThe main exposure pathways for human and environmental exposures are shown in Figure 2. For the general population, PFAS sources include drinking water, food, consumer products and dust (EFSA, 2018). In food, fish species at the top of the food chain and shellfish are significant sources of PFAS exposure. Livestock raised on contaminated land can accumulate PFAS in their meat, milk and eggs (Ingelido et al., 2018; Numata et al., 2014). Direct exposure may also come via skin creams and cosmetics (Danish EPA, 2018; Schultes et al., 2018) or via air from sprays and dust from PFAS-coated textiles. There is little knowledge on uptake via skin and the lungs, which can be severely affected by PFAS (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 2010; S\u00f8rli et al., 2020). Consumer exposure may also occur via other routes such as via floor, wood, stone, and car polishing and cleaning products. Groups that may be exposed to high concentrations of PFAS include workers and people eating or drinking water and foods contaminated via PFAS treated food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019). Though PFAS are used in drugs and medical equipment, there is little information on exposure via these routes.\nPFAS are transferred in the womb from mother to child and unless exposure decreases with age, the PFAS body burden increases due to bioaccumulation (Koponen et al., 2018). Evidence of internal PFAS exposure in humans is available from several national human biomonitoring studies conducted inside and outside Europe. Men generally have higher PFAS body burdens and serum levels (Ingelido et al., 2018) because they excrete fewer PFAS. For the most regulated PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS, consistent declines have been observed over the past 10-20 years in Europe (e.g. in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden). This decrease in levels in humans is likely to result from reduced exposure as a result of regulatory and non-regulatory action on consumer products, such as food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019) and textiles (Greenpeace, 2017).\nDespite the decreases in long-chain PFAS levels in human blood, concentrations of PFOA and PFOS measured in human blood still exceed the EFSA benchmark dose levels (known as BMDL5). This is particularly true for children and highly exposed sections of the European population (Buekers et al., 2018). The BMDL5 reflect the concentration in blood at which critical effects occur (cholesterol effects for adults and immune-toxicity for children) and are the basis for the provisional TWIs for PFOA and PFOS (EFSA, 2018).\nThe above mentioned human biomonitoring study in the Veneto Region investigated human exposure to PFOA and PFOS in the period 2015-2016 among 257 Italian residents of contaminated areas and 250 residents of background areas (Ingelido et al., 2018). The PFOA blood concentrations of residents of contaminated areas were 9-64 times higher than those of the background population. For PFOS, the levels were 1.4-1.6 times higher. Levels of PFOA in the highly exposed population were 0.2 to 26 times greater than the EFSA BDML5, while for PFOS, the figure was 0.3-1.3 times. EU research projects, such as Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) (Box 2), are currently working to produce a representative picture of PFAS exposure for the European population, as well as investigating links between exposure and health effects.\nIt is difficult for citizens to totally avoid exposure to PFAS. Using PFAS-free personal care products and cooking materials and avoiding direct contact with PFAS-containing products helps to reduce exposure. Decreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS. General and specific guidance to consumers and business on how to find PFAS-free alternatives is provided by consumer organisations and some national institutions (see Danish EPA, German EPA and Swedish KEMI).\nDecreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS\n\u00a9 Engin_Akyurt / Pixabay\nMeasures to reduce PFAS pollution are in place, mainly addressing well-known PFAS substances and their precursors. PFOS and PFOA are listed under Annex A of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), implying that parties to the Convention should \u2018eliminate the production and use\u2019 of the chemicals.\nAt EU level, PFOS is restricted under the EU POPs Regulation (EU, 2019). PFOA and its precursors are currently restricted under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (EU, 2006), including their presence in products made or imported into the EU. This will soon be replaced by a new restriction under the POPs Regulation, which will have more limited derogations, following a decision taken at the Stockholm Convention.\nA number of other PFAS are on the REACH list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs). In June 2019, GenX (a short-chain PFAS substitute for PFOA in fluoropolymer production) was the first chemical added to the SVHC list on the basis of its persistent, mobile and toxic properties posing a threat to drinking water and the environment. Several PFAS are on the Community Rolling Action Plan for evaluation over the coming years. As mentioned above, PFOA and PFOS are priority hazardous substances under the Water Framework Directive (EC, 2017; EU, 2000).\nAcross Europe, several countries have been active in monitoring PFAS in environmental media as well as in humans and products. Some countries have set national limit values for water and soil (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), for textiles (Norway) and for food contact materials (Denmark). Several EU Member States have set drinking water limits for specific PFAS and for groups of PFAS (Dauchy, 2019). In June 2019, Denmark announced a ban on PFAS-treated food contact materials, to enter into force in 2020.\nWith more than 4 700 known PFAS, undertaking substance-by-substance risk assessments and comprehensive environmental monitoring to understand exposure would be an extremely lengthy and resource-intensive process. As a result, complementary and precautionary approaches to managing PFAS are being explored.\nThis includes the regulation of PFAS as a class, or as subgroups, based on toxicity or chemical similarities. The proposal to establish a new \u2018group limit\u2019 value for PFAS of 0.5 \u00b5g/L, in addition to limits for 16 individual PFAS of 0.1 \u00b5g/L in drinking water under the recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive is currently under consideration at EU level. Such measures can be supported by cost-effective and targeted monitoring of PFAS in the environment to provide early warning signals of pollution.\nIn June 2019, the European Council of Ministers (EC, 2019) highlighted the widespread occurrence of PFAS in the environment, products and people, and called for an action plan to eliminate all non-essential uses of PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019).\nThe move towards zero pollution requires that product life cycles are made safer from the start (Warner and Ludwig, 2016), based on the concept of safe-and-circular-by-design (van der Waals et al., 2019). This approach offers opportunities to protect the health of Europe\u2019s citizens and environment at the same time as driving innovation for safer chemicals.\nKissa, E., 2001, \u2018Fluorinated Surfactants and Repellents: Second Edition, Revised and Expanded Surfactant Science Series.

Many of the things \nthat we had taken for granted were suddenly not available to us anymore. The pandemic \ncaught the world by surprise, but, if you had asked a scientist working in a field related to \ninfectious diseases, this was only a matter of time.\n\nOne cannot help drawing parallels between \nthe pandemic, the climate crisis and the \nbiodiversity crisis. Scientists had warned \nus about a pandemic \u2014 there were rather \naccurate scenarios \u2014 but nobody knew \nexactly how it would unfold.\n\nWe cannot paint an exact picture of a world \nthat is two or four degrees warmer. We do \nnot know exactly what the tipping points will \nbe for entire ecosystems. What we do know is \nthat, unless we take decisive action and aim \nfor systemic transitions, the outlook is not \npositive and time is running out. A\u00a0pandemic \ncan, we hope, be controlled in a relatively \nshort period of time. It might prove to be \nmuch more difficult to reverse any damage \ncaused by reaching a tipping point in climate \nchange or in the degradation of nature.\n\nThe links between these fast- and \nslow-moving crises and pollution are \nclear. Cutting air pollution and reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions almost always \ngo hand in hand. Curbing water and soil \npollution would benefit nature. Reducing \nresource use and moving to a circular \neconomy would also reduce pollution.\n\nMany health authorities have warned that \ncitizens with certain pre-existing conditions \nmay be more vulnerable to COVID-19. \nThese pre-existing conditions include \nrespiratory illnesses, which are, in some \ncases, a consequence of, or exacerbated \nby, poor air quality.\n\nAs a result of the harsh lockdown \nmeasures, the concentrations of some \nkey air pollutants dropped dramatically \nin many European cities. These shocks \nwere not wanted \u2014 they are not a model \nfor a well-managed transition \u2014 but \nthey showed that air quality in cities can \nbe improved dramatically by reducing \ncar traffic and changing our current \nmobility\u00a0patterns.\n\nHuman beings and the institutions we have \nbuilt are wired to deal efficiently with clear \nand present danger. Unclear, invisible or \nslow-moving catastrophes are harder for \nus to comprehend and tackle. Pollution is \none such challenge.\n\f\n6\n\nIn most places in Europe, air does not look, \nfeel, smell or taste dirty. Yet, every year, \npoor air quality causes the premature death \nof nearly half a million Europeans. Tap water \nin Europe is generally safe to drink. We can \nenjoy fishing and swimming in many of our \nrivers, lakes and coastal areas. Yet, many \nof Europe\u2019s water bodies are not in good \ncondition. Europe\u2019s soils still suffer from \npollution that was released decades or \ncenturies ago.\n\nThe problems are clear but we should also \nremember that actions and policies to \ntackle pollution have made a difference. \nThe\u00a0number of Europeans dying \nprematurely as a result of poor air quality is \nless than half of early 1990s levels. Europe\u2019s \nindustry is becoming cleaner, with fewer \nemissions to air and water. Advanced waste \nwater treatment covers more and more \ncommunities. Our agricultural practices are \nslowly evolving.\n\nYet, we can and should do much more. This \nwill require the better implementation of \nexisting policies and also ambitious targets \nthat show a path towards climate neutrality, \nzero pollution, circular economy, healthy \nnature, and social justice in this fundamental \nsustainability transition.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the \nEuropean Commission, has set an ambitious \nagenda for her team\u2019s political priorities \nfor the next 5 years. The European Green \nDeal and its zero pollution ambition outline \nactions that reflect European citizens\u2019 \n\ndemand for addressing the climate and \nbiodiversity crises, while ensuring a just \ntransition where people are not left behind. \nThis is an agenda that could have a lasting \nlegacy in Europe.\n\nThe European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) \nwork has shown that our unsustainable \nsystems of production and consumption \u2014 \nespecially those related to food, mobility and \nenergy \u2014 are at the core of our sustainability \nchallenges, including pollution. These \nsystems are deeply integrated into our way \nof life and cannot be changed overnight but \nwe must move in the right direction and our \nambition needs to match our capabilities.\n\nFor the first time in modern history, we have \nthe means to aspire to generating heat and \nelectricity, moving around and growing food \nwithout harmful pollution. We no longer \nneed to accept pollution that affects people \nand the environment as an inevitable side \nproduct of progress.\n\nEurope has shown that we can make \nprogress with strong and binding legislation. \nWhen harmful technologies are banned, we \nfind better ways of doing things. Increasing \nknowledge and putting a steep enough price \ntag on pollution has proven to work. There \nare many policy instruments to choose from \nand, as long as the ambition is right, people \nwill find ways to move in the right direction.\n\f\n\u00a9 Perry Wunderlich, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nThe EEA has a lot of knowledge and \nexpertise to offer on pollution and other \nenvironmental challenges as well as \nsolutions for them. EEA Signals 2020 \nprovides a glimpse of the issues we seek \nto\u00a0address.\n\n\u2018Never again...\u2019 is a phrase that human kind \nhas had to say to itself too often. Yet, this \nconviction of not repeating past mistakes \nand not allowing the same tragedies to \nunfold has also led to movements and \ninstitutions, including the European Union, \nthat have protected individuals and made \nour societies stronger.\n\nThe \u2018Next Generation EU\u2019 recovery package \naims to repair the economic and social \ndamage brought by the coronavirus \npandemic. The package is about next \ngenerations, our future, and about \nreinventing our economy and society in a \nway that respects the limits of our planet \nand ensures people\u2019s long-term well-being.\n\nDespite progress over past decades, the \nEEA\u2019s landmark assessment \u2018The European \nenvironment \u2014 state and outlook 2020\u2019 \nclearly showed that Europe now faces \nenvironmental challenges of unprecedented \nscale and urgency. We must take urgent \naction over the next 10 years to protect the \nenvironment, the climate and people.\n\nHans Bruyninckx\nEEA Executive Director\n\n7\n\f\n20:20\n\nEnergy production and \ndistribution are the main source \nof sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions \n\nand a major source of NOx emissions.\n\nTransport is responsible for around 45 % \nof Europe's emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) \n\nand a significant proportion of the total emissions\nof other key pollutants.\n\nUnsustainable farming practices lead to \npollution of soil, water, air and food, overexploitation\nof natural resources, and biodiversity loss and\necosystem degradation.\n\nWaste production and poor waste management \ncontribute to air pollution and affect ecosystems. \nDump sites, illegal disposal and littering create \nfurther risks, including soil pollution and marine litter.\n\nRoad traffic is the most widespread source\n of environmental noise, with more than\n\n \n\npeople affected \nby harmful levels in Europe. \n\n100 million\n\nof fine particulate matter (PM2.5) \nemissions. \n\nDomestic heating is an important source\nof dust pollution.

Different types of pollutants include chemicals, dust, noise and radiation. These pollutants have \nmany different sources. Some of those sources are diffuse, such as transport or agriculture, whereas \nothers are linked to a specific place, such as a factory or power plant. \n\nSources:  NEDC data viewer1 and LRTAP data viewer2, EEA report - The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 20203, \nEEA indicator - Exposure of Europe\u2019s population to environmental noise4.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-3\f\n20:20\n\nEnergy production and \ndistribution are the main source \nof sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions \n\nand a major source of NOx emissions.\n\nTransport is responsible for around 45 % \nof Europe's emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) \n\nand a significant proportion of the total emissions\nof other key pollutants.\n\nUnsustainable farming practices lead to \npollution of soil, water, air and food, overexploitation\nof natural resources, and biodiversity loss and\necosystem degradation.\n\nWaste production and poor waste management \ncontribute to air pollution and affect ecosystems. \nDump sites, illegal disposal and littering create \nfurther risks, including soil pollution and marine litter.\n\nRoad traffic is the most widespread source\n of environmental noise, with more than\n\n \n\npeople affected \nby harmful levels in Europe. \n\n100 million\n\nof fine particulate matter (PM2.5) \nemissions. \n\nDomestic heating is an important source\nof dust pollution.

EEA Signals 2020 \nlooks at pollution through different lenses related to the Agency\u2019s work and EU legislation.\n\f\n10\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s zero pollution ambition\n\nThe zero-pollution ambition for Europe was announced in the European Green \nDeal, part of the European Commission\u2019s strategy to implement the United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals agenda. Its key aim is to protect citizens and \necosystems by better monitoring, reporting, preventing and remedying pollution. \n\nThe zero-pollution ambition can help the EU further decouple prosperity from harmful \nlevels of pollution, while enhancing EU resilience and strategic autonomy. This \ncan also support a sustainable post-COVID-19 recovery by, for instance: helping to \nmainstream the zero-pollution ambition in recovery efforts; promoting adequate and \ntimely information on the health and economic benefits of acting on pollution; and \nexploring further development of business practices that reduce pollution, create job \nopportunities and reduce social inequalities, as pollution disproportionately affects the \nmost vulnerable\u00a0people. \n\nAs part of the wider zero-pollution ambition, the European Commission has already \nannounced actions to reduce pollution in several Green Deal initiatives, in particular the \nCircular Economy Action Plan, the Biodiversity Strategy and the Farm to Fork Strategy. \n\nForeseen to be published in 2020 and 2021, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability \nand the Zero-Pollution Action Plan will help boost cleaner products and technologies \nacross all relevant economic sectors, prioritising pollution prevention over remediation. \nFollowing an open public consultation, the Zero-Pollution Action Plan is foreseen for the \nfirst half of\u00a02021.\n\nThe Zero-Pollution Action Plan will, amongst other priorities, focus on enhancing \nimplementation of existing and new legislation, revising key pollution control \ninstruments, addressing pollutants of emerging concern, and setting up an integrated \nzero-pollution monitoring and outlook framework. The European Environment Agency \nwill be a key partner in these activities.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/\f\n11\u00a9 Jose Luis Mendez Fernandez, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 11\n\f\n\u00a9 Plamen Hristov, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA12\n\f\n13\n\nImproving air quality \nimproves people\u2019s health \nand\u00a0productivity\nEurope\u2019s air quality has improved significantly over recent decades but pollutants still \nharm our health and the environment. Measures to limit pollution would improve \nour quality of life, save money in healthcare, boost workers\u2019 productivity and protect \nthe\u00a0environment.\n\nEurope\u2019s air is a lot cleaner than it was when \nthe European Union (EU) and its Member \nStates started introducing air quality and \npollution prevention and control policies \nabout half a century ago. European and \nnational policies and local actions have \nbeen able to curb pollution from transport, \nindustry and the energy sector.\n\nDespite this progress, the EEA\u2019s annual Air \nquality in Europe5 assessments consistently \nshow that air pollution still poses a danger \nto human health and the environment. Air \npollution levels in many of Europe\u2019s cities \nstill exceed both the EU\u2019s legal limits and \nthe World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) \nguidelines for the protection of human \nhealth. The tragic consequence of this \nis that, according to the EEA\u2019s estimates, \nevery year about 400\u00a0000 Europeans die \nprematurely because of poor air quality.\n\nAir pollution is the number one cause of \npremature deaths from environmental \nfactors in Europe but it also has \nconsiderable economic impacts. It \nincreases medical costs and reduces \neconomic productivity due to the ill health \nof workers. Air pollution also harms soil, \ncrops, forests, lakes and rivers. Pollutants \neven damage our houses, bridges and \nother built infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, the negative impacts of poor air \nquality are not equally distributed across \nsociety. A recent EEA report6 showed \nthat air pollution, as well as extreme \ntemperatures and noise, disproportionately \naffect Europe\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, \nespecially in Europe\u2019s eastern and \nsouthern regions. In addition to overall \nimprovements, targeted action is needed to \nbetter protect vulnerable\u00a0groups.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/air-quality-in-europe-2019\f\n14\n\nCOVID-19 and air pollution\n\nA decrease in many societal and economic activities during the pandemic led to a \ndecrease in emissions and subsequent levels of certain air pollutants. For example, \nthe use of vehicles declined during lockdowns and this led to lower nitrogen dioxide \nconcentrations in many cities across Europe7.\n\nExposure to air pollution is associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases \n\u2014 both health conditions known to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 and negatively \ninfluence prognosis. Some non-peer-reviewed articles have suggested links between air \npollution and high COVID-19 mortality rates, for example in Italy and the United States, \nbut further epidemiological research is required to clarify possible causal associations.\n\nFind out more: www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore8.\n\nDeeply rooted, systemic problems\n\nParticulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide \n(NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) are the \npollutants that cause the greatest harm \nto human health and the environment \nin Europe. The main sources of these \npollutants are road transport, domestic \nheating, agriculture and industry.\n\nIn cities, where about three out of four \nEuropeans live, road transport is often the \nmain source of air pollution, especially because \ncars emit pollutants at the ground level, close \nto people. In parts of Europe, domestic heating \nwith wood and coal is the most important \nsource of harmful pollutants. Unfortunately, \nthese emissions also increase during winter \nmonths when weather conditions often \nprevent pollutants from dispersing.\n\nWhat is common to the sources of \nair pollutants is that they are deeply \nrooted in our societies\u2019 core systems of \nmobility, energy and food production and \nconsumption. These same systems are not \n\nonly the main sources of air pollutants, but \nalso the root causes of the climate crisis and \nthe rapid loss of biodiversity.\n\nHow we move people and goods around, how \nwe generate heat and electricity, and how we \nproduce and consume our food are, in many \nways, the foundations of our current way \nof life. This is why changing these systems \nis not easy. In many cases, it requires us to \nreconsider the way we have built our societies \nand the way in which we live our lives.\n\nWin-win solutions for cleaner air\n\nThe EEA has worked together with a \nnumber of European cities in a pilot \nproject9 to better understand the \nchallenges to improving air quality at the \nlocal level. The 10 cities that participated \nin the pilot project have, for example, \nexpanded district heating, promoted \ncycling, lowered speed limits and issued \ncongestion charges to improve local air \nquality. Other successful initiatives include \nrelocating industrial facilities, modernising \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-and-covid19/air-quality-and-covid19\f\n\u00a9 Javier Arcenillas, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nhousehold stoves and boilers, using \ncleaner fuels for heating, switching to \ncleaner buses and trams, and introducing \nlow-emission transport zones.\n\nThese measures reduce local air pollution \nand often noise, and they improve \nresidents\u2019 quality of life. Moreover, the \nsame actions cut greenhouse gas emissions \nand, in many cases, save money. Still, \nthe same cities also reported important \nchallenges, especially in engaging with \ncitizens and making the political case for \nmeasures to improve air\u00a0quality.\n\nFor best results, local and regional actions \ngo along with effective national and \nEU policies that often offer substantial \nco-benefits in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions and air pollution at the same \ntime. These co-benefits can be achieved by, \nfor example, improving energy efficiency \nand greening the mobility\u00a0system.\n\nPeople demand clean air\n\nA recent report by the European Court of \nAuditors10 noted that citizens can play a \nkey role in pushing for better air quality. \nTo inform citizens, the EEA gives access to \nnear-real time data and statistics about \nair quality. The EEA and the European \nCommission have also built an online tool, \nthe European Air Quality Index11, which \nallows citizens across Europe to check \ncurrent air quality where they live, work or \ntravel. The index is calculated with hourly \ndata from more than 2\u00a0000 air quality \nmonitoring stations across Europe and \nalso provides health-related information \nand\u00a0recommendations.\n\n15\n\nhttps://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR18_23/SR_AIR_QUALITY_EN.pdf\f\n16\n\nPeople are increasingly interested in the \nquality of the air they breathe, with some \ncitizens taking steps to measure their local air \nquality themselves through citizen science12. \nThe EEA is working together with the European \nNetwork of the Heads of Environmental \nProtection Agencies (EPA Network) on a \nproject called CleanAir@School13, which \ninvolves having children, parents and \nteachers measure pollutant concentrations \naround\u00a0schools.\n\nThe schools that participate in the project \nmeasure nitrogen dioxide concentrations \nwith simple low-cost devices, placing one \nsampler beside the road in front of the \nschool and one in a less polluted area, such \nas the grounds behind the school. The \nproject aims to raise awareness of traffic \nas a source of air pollution and encourage \nparents to shift away from bringing their \nchildren to school by car.\n\nTowards zero air pollution\n\nLocal-, regional-, national- and EU-level \nactions and policies with binding targets \nhave improved air quality in Europe for the \nbenefit of its citizens and the environment. \nMore and more people across the world \nare demanding similar progress. Reducing \nthe number of deaths and illnesses from \n\nair pollution is one of the targets of the \nSustainable Development Goals that aim to \nensure healthy lives and promote well-being. \nA similar target is included for sustainable \ncities and communities. Like the other goals, \nachieving this would bring massive global \nbenefits, including increased productivity \nand reduced medical costs.\n\nThe actions that are necessary to cut air \npollution, both in Europe and globally, are \nlargely the same actions that are necessary \nto address the climate crisis and stop \nthe degradation of nature. We need to \nfundamentally change and decarbonise our \nsystems of production and consumption, \nespecially those related to mobility, energy \nand food.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Air pollution: www.eea.europa.eu/\nthemes/air\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 8 on air pollution: \nwww.eea.europa.eu/publications/\nsoer-2020/chapter-08_soer2020-airpollution/view\n\n\u2022 European Air Quality Index: www.eea.\neuropa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-index\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/assessing-air-quality-through-citizen-science\f\n4-8 %\n\n13-17 %\n\n12-34 %\n\n4-7 %\n\n15-20 %\n\n< 1 %\n\nWHO guidelinesEU limit/target values\n\nPM2.5\n\nPM10\n\nO3\n\nNO2\n\nBaP\n\nSO2\n\n74-78 %\n\n43-48 %\n\n96-99 %\n\n4-7 %\n\n75-90 %\n\n19-31 %\n\nShare of the EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above EU and\nWHO reference values in 2016-2018\n\nMain air pollutants and their effects on human health\n\nParticulate matter (PM) is emitted from many \nsources and is one of the most harmful pollutants to \nhuman health. It penetrates sensitive regions of the \nrespiratory system and can cause or aggravate \ncardiovascular and lung diseases as well as cancers.\n\nGround-level ozone (O3) is an air pollutant that affects \nhuman health, vegetation and materials. Ozone is \nformed when other pollutants react with sunlight.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) are \nemitted from fuel combustion, such as from power \nplants and other industrial facilities. They contribute to \nacidification and eutrophication of waters and soils. In \nthe air, they can cause health problems, such as airway \ninflammation and reduced lung function.\n\nOrganic pollutants, such as Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), \nare emitted from fuel and waste combustion, industrial \nprocesses and solvent use. Substances such as \nhexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \ncan have a range of harmful effects on human health \nand ecosystems.\n\nHeavy metals, such as lead and mercury, are toxic to \necosystems. They are mainly emitted from combustion \nprocesses and industrial activities. As well as polluting \nthe air, they can build up in soils and sediments, and \nbio-accumulate in food chains.\n\nAmmonia (NH3) is emitted mainly from agriculture and \ncontributes to both eutrophication and acidification of \nwaters and soils.\n\nAir quality problems in Europe\u2019s cities\nAlmost all Europeans who live in cities are exposed to air pollution that exceeds the levels set in the \nWorld Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) guidelines for clean air. Air pollution is the greatest environmental \nhealth hazard in Europe and globally.\n\nSource: EEA report - Healthy environment, healthy lives14.\n\n17\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/healthy-environment-healthy-lives\f\n\u00a9 Jacob Kaptein, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA18\n\f\n19\n\nEnsuring clean waters for \npeople and nature\nWater covers more than 70\u00a0% of the Earth\u2019s surface and is essential to all life on our \nplanet. Of all the Earth\u2019s water, 96.5\u00a0% is contained within the oceans as salt water, \nwhereas the remaining 3.5\u00a0% is freshwater \u2014 lakes, rivers, groundwater and ice. Good \nmanagement of this limited and precious resource is indispensable for the well-being of \npeople and nature.\n\nThroughout history, people have settled \nclose to rivers, lakes and coastlines. Rivers \nand streams brought clean water and took \naway waste. As human settlements grew, so \ndid their use of clean water and discharge \nof polluted water. From the 18th century \nonwards, Europe\u2019s water bodies also started \nreceiving pollutants from industry.\n\nWith sewage systems, waste water \ntreatment facilities and the regulation of \npollutants from industry and agriculture, \nEurope has come a long way in reducing \nemissions to water bodies. Nevertheless, \nwater pollution continues to be a problem, \nwith over-exploitation, physical alterations \nand climate change continuing to affect the \nquality and the availability of water.\n\nA mixed picture \u2014 the state of \nEurope\u2019s water bodies\n\nAbout 88\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s freshwater use \ncomes from rivers and groundwater. The \nrest comes from reservoirs (about 10\u00a0%) \nand lakes (less than 2\u00a0%). Like any other vital \nresource or living organism, water can come \nunder pressure. This can happen when \ndemand for water exceeds its supply or \nwhen pollution reduces its quality.\n\nWaste water treatment and reductions \nin nitrogen and phosphorus losses \nfrom agriculture have led to significant \nimprovements in water quality. However, \naccording to the EEA\u2019s most recent data15, \nonly 44\u00a0% of surface waters in Europe \nachieve good or high ecological status, \npartly because of pollution. The situation of \nEurope\u2019s groundwater is somewhat better. \nAbout 75\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s groundwater areas \nhas a \u2018good chemical status\u201916.\n\nMarine environment\nunder threat\n\nThe current condition of Europe\u2019s seas \n\u2014 from the Baltic to the Mediterranean \u2014 \nis\u00a0generally poor, according to the EEA\u2019s \nMarine messages II17 assessment. Despite \nsome positive developments achieved \nthrough regional cooperation, a range of \npressures from historic and current human \nactivities could cause irreversible damage to \nmarine ecosystems.\n\nMoreover, the EEA\u2019s report on \ncontaminants in Europe\u2019s seas18 showed \nthat all four regional seas in Europe have \na large-scale contamination problem, \nranging from 96\u00a0% of the assessed area \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/european-waters/water-quality-and-water-assessment/water-assessments/ecological-status-of-surface-water-bodies\f\n20 \u00a9 Alberto Cob, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nin the Baltic Sea and 91\u00a0% in the Black \nSea to 87\u00a0% in the Mediterranean Sea and \n75\u00a0% in the North\u2011East Atlantic Ocean. The \ncontamination problem is mainly caused \nby synthetic chemicals and heavy metals \noriginating from human activities both on \nland and at\u00a0sea.\n\nSimilarly, the EEA\u2019s report on nutrient \nenrichment and eutrophication in Europe\u2019s \nseas19 showed that eutrophication as a \nconsequence of nutrient losses, mainly \nfrom agriculture, is another large-scale \nproblem, especially in the Baltic Sea and the \nBlack Sea.\n\nCoastal and maritime activities, such as \nfishing, shipping, tourism, aquaculture and \nthe extraction of oil and gas, cause multiple \npressures on the marine environment, \nincluding pollution. Marine litter is present in \nall marine ecosystems, with plastics, metals, \ncardboard and other waste accumulating \non shorelines, the seabed and surface \nwaters. Ships and offshore activities also \ncause underwater noise pollution, which can \nnegatively affect marine life.\n\nTackling water pollution \u2014 waste \nwater and diffuse pollution\n\nMuch has been done across Europe to \nenable the collection and treatment of \nurban waste water. According to EEA data20, \nmost European countries were collecting \nand treating sewage at the tertiary level \nfrom most of their population by 2017. \nStill, in a number of European countries \nless than 80\u00a0% of the population was \nconnected to public urban waste water \ntreatment\u00a0systems.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/nutrient-enrichment-and-eutrophication-in\f\n21\n\nMeanwhile, existing infrastructure \nrequires maintenance and new pressures \nrequire substantial investments, including \nadapting to climate change, providing \nimproved waste water facilities and \ntackling new concerns, such as medicines \nor the so-called mobile chemicals in \nwaste\u00a0water.\n\nIn addition to point source pollution from \nindustry and waste water treatment plants, \nwater bodies also suffer from diffuse \npollution, for example from transport, \nagriculture, forestry and rural dwellings. \nPollutants that are first released to air and \nsoil often also end up in water bodies.\n\nIntensive agriculture\n\nIntensive agriculture relies on fertilisers to \nincrease crop yields. These fertilisers often \nwork by introducing nitrogen, phosphorus \n\nand other chemicals into the soil. Nitrogen is \na chemical element abundant in nature and \nis essential for plant growth.\n\nHowever, some of the nitrogen intended for \ncrops is not taken up by plants. The amount of \nfertiliser applied may be more than the plant \ncan absorb or it may not be applied during the \nplant\u2019s growing period. This excess nitrogen \nfinds its way into water bodies and there it \nboosts the growth of certain water plants and \nalgae in a process known as eutrophication. \nThis extra growth depletes the oxygen in the \nwater, rendering it uninhabitable for other \nanimal and plant species.\n\nPesticides used in agriculture aim to protect \ncrops from invasive pests, ensuring crop \ngrowth. However, these effects can occur \nbeyond the intended target, harming other \nspecies and reducing biodiversity. Often, \nthese chemicals end up in water bodies.\n\nCOVID-19 and water pollution\n\nLower economic activity during lockdowns is likely to lead to lower emissions to water \nfrom industry, while emissions from schools and workplaces are likely to shift towards \nhouseholds. There may be less water stress in specific areas in Europe, depending on \nthe impacts on agriculture and energy production. Reduced tourism is also likely to lead \nto lower emissions to water along European coasts and in other tourist destinations.\n\nFind out more: www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore21.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore/\f\n\u00a9 Erik Mclean, Unsplash\n\nPlastics in the water \u2014 \nsize\u00a0matters\n\nPlastics have become integral to almost \nevery aspect of our lives, and the issue of \nplastics entering our waterways, lakes and \nseas is dramatic and well documented.\n\nClearing visible plastic litter from rivers, \nbeaches and even the sea might still be \npossible but, with time and exposure to \nsunlight, plastic waste fragments into \never-smaller pieces, known as micro- and \nnanoplastics. Waste water treatment plants \ncan filter out most of these tiny particles \nbut the remaining sludge is often spread on \nland, with plastic particles sometimes being \nwashed into water bodies by rainfall. These \nsmallest particles are hardly visible to the \neye and their impacts on nature and our \nhealth are still poorly understood.\n\nMany plastics are also highly adsorbent, \nattracting other contaminants. As noted \nin the EEA report on the state of Europe\u2019s \nseas22, concentrations of contaminants in \npieces of microplastic can be thousands of \ntimes greater than in ambient seawater. This \nexposes marine life to harmful chemicals, \nwhich, in turn, can end up on our\u00a0plates.\n\nTowards zero water pollution\n\nIn the past decades, Europe has made \nsignificant efforts to improve water quality, \ntreat waste water and protect marine and \nfreshwater habitats and species. Today, \nEU policies address a wide range of issues \naffecting water, such as drinking water, \nurban waste water, bathing water quality, \nsingle-use plastics, industrial emissions \n\n22\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/state-of-europes-seas\f\n23\n\nand hazardous chemicals. Overarching \nprogrammes and legislation, such as the \nWater Framework Directive23 and the \nMarine Strategy Framework Directive24, \nstrengthen these specific pieces of \nEU\u00a0legislation.\n\nHowever, efforts to move towards zero \npollution will require a major focus on \nwater as part of the European Green \nDeal\u2019s zero pollution action plan, including \naiming to restore the natural functions \nof groundwater, surface water, marine \nand coastal waters, tackling pollution \nfrom urban runoff, and addressing new \nconcerns, such as microplastics and \nchemicals.\n\nAs one of the key components of the \nEuropean Green Deal, the farm to fork \nstrategy aims to significantly reduce \nthe agricultural use and risk of chemical \npesticides25, the use of antibiotics26 and \nfertiliser losses to the environment, \nfor example through integrated pest \nmanagement and an integrated nutrient \nmanagement action plan. The EU 2030 \nbiodiversity strategy also supports \nsimilar\u00a0objectives.\n\nTo help tackle the plastics problem, the EU \nhas already proposed a plastics strategy27 \nthat aims to \u2018transform the way products \nare designed, produced, used, and \nrecycled in the EU\u2019. Meanwhile, consumer \nattitudes are changing and innovations \nmean that some items previously made \nfrom plastics can now be produced from \ncellulose sourced from recycled paper, \ntextiles, plants or algae.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Water and marine environment:   \nwww.eea.europa.eu/themes/water\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 4 on freshwater: \nwww.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer2020/chapter-04_soer2020-freshwater/\nview\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 6 on the marine \nenvironment: www.eea.europa.eu/\npublications/soer-2020/chapter-06_\nsoer2020-marine-environment/view\n\n\u2022 EEA Signals 2018 \u2014 Water is life: www.\neea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2018content-list\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/index_en.html\f\n2\n\n21\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n+CO2\n\n+CO2\n\n+CO2\n\n5\n\n7\n\n6\n\n75\n\n4\n\n4\n\n1\n\n3\n\nof Europe\u2019s need for drinking\nwater and agricultural activities\nis covered by groundwater\n\n40 %\n\nWaste water\ntreatment\n\nCanals\n\nHigher water temperature\n\nDams\n\nMain problems\n\nChemical pollution\n\nNutrient enrichment and eutrophication\n\nPressures from coastal and maritime activities,\nincluding marine litter and underwater noise\n\nClimate change\n\nMain problems\n\nChemical pollution deposited by air\n\nBuilt alterations\n\nNutrient pollution from agriculture\n\nGroundwater\n\n75 %\nof groundwater areas have good chemical status\n\nSurface waters\n(rivers, lakes and transitional waters)\n\n44 %\nhave good or high ecological status of assessed areas in Europe\u2019s seas have\n\na contamination problem\n\nSea\n\n75-96 %\n\nAcidification\n\n24\n\nState of water in Europe\nWaste water treatment and reductions in nutrient losses from agriculture have led to significant \nimprovements in water quality in Europe.

The presence of chemicals might be the answer. From heavy metals \nto organic pollutants and microplastics, the soil in which we grow our food and the \nland on which we build our homes might be contaminated with different pollutants. \nContaminants are widespread and are accumulating in Europe\u2019s land and soils. How can \nwe tackle this problem?\n\nThe ground below our feet is much more \nthan rocks, soil and silt. Every square metre \ncan be unique in terms of its composition, \nits structure and the life that it contains and \nsupports. Some contain more rocks rich in \ncertain minerals; others are rich in plant \nresidues with pockets of air and water.\n\nSoil is often a neglected domain of biodiversity \nbut even a small patch can teem with life, \nranging from tiny organisms to fungi and \nearthworms, all playing a vital role in the \nfunctioning of the soil ecosystem. It is also in \nthis space that nutrients are turned into forms \nthat plants can take up, allowing biomass to \nform and store carbon. It is also here that our \nprospective drinking water starts its natural \npurification journey towards groundwater.\n\nA local problem?\n\nThe way we use land often introduces \nadditional substances to these unique \necosystems in order to protect selected \ncrops or add nutrients. Pollutants released \nfrom industry, transport and other economic \nactivities can also travel long distances and \n\nreach soils, where they become diluted and \nare temporarily stored. Soil, a component \nof land, is considered polluted when \ncontaminants adversely affect human health \nor the environment.\n\nWith every step we take, we could be \nstanding on top of a very different mix \nand concentration of contaminants in the \nground. The large variation of contaminants, \nsoils, and climatic and land use conditions \nmakes it costly to monitor and assess the \nfull extent of land and soil pollution. What \nwe know is mostly based on field samples \nscattered across countries.\n\nMetals, fertilisers and pesticides\n\nWe need agriculture to grow our food but \nsome unsustainable farming practices \ncontinue to contaminate soils.\n\nPlants need, among other things, nutrients \nto grow and intensive agriculture can \ndeplete nutrients in the soil faster than \nnature replenishes them. Fertilisers work \nby compensating this deficit by introducing \n\nLand and soil pollution \n\u2014 widespread, harmful \nand\u00a0growing\n\f\n28\n\nextra nutrients. Unfortunately, the whole \namount is often not taken up by the plants \nand the surplus that is initially in soil, sooner \nor later, enters lakes and rivers. Once in \nwater, surplus nitrogen often leads to \nexcessive growth of plants and algae, the \ndecomposition of which can severely reduce \noxygen levels in water, harming animal and \nplant species in that ecosystem.\n\nCopper has been used extensively as a \nfungicide in vineyards and orchards for \ndecades. A recent large-scale study29 showed \nthat copper concentrations in vineyards \nwere three times higher than the average \nin European soils. Copper is also added \nto animal feed and is introduced to the \nenvironment when manure is spread over \ngrasslands and other agricultural lands.\n\nCadmium is another highly toxic metal \nfound in mineral phosphorus fertilisers. \nSome \u2018organic fertilisers\u2019, such as sewage \nsludges, manure, compost and bio-waste, \ncan also introduce a broad mix of heavy \nmetals and organic pollutants if they are not \nwell\u00a0regulated.\n\nChemicals from the long-term use of \npesticides are also found in soil samples \nfrom across Europe. Over 80\u00a0% of soils \ntested in one study30 contained pesticide \nresidues, with 58\u00a0% containing two or more \ntypes of residue. \n\nWaste management, industry and \nbeyond the borders\n\nAgricultural practices are far from being \nthe only source of land and soil pollution. \nPoorly managed waste \u2014 both municipal \n\nand industrial waste \u2014 is responsible for \nmore than one third of local contaminations, \nfollowed by industrial activities. Of the \nseveral millions of sites estimated to carry \nout potentially polluting activities in the EU, \ndetailed public information exists for only \na\u00a0fraction31.\n\nLand and soil pollution is also a global \nproblem. Air and water can transport \npollutants, including nitrogen compounds \nand tiny plastic fragments, across the \nglobe and deposit them on land surfaces. \nPollutants are found even on the highest \npeaks and the most remote beaches.\n\nForever they remain and \naccumulate\n\nSome pollutants break down in soil over \ntime but others remain forever. In many \ncases, land and its soils are the final \ndestination where various pollutants end \nup and accumulate over time. The full risks \nof these chemicals and various mixes of \nthem are not fully known. However, based \non sampled sites, we know that land and \nsoil pollution can have significant impacts \non human health as well as soil biodiversity \nand ecosystem health. These pollutants \ncan affect soil organisms and possibly \ncontaminate our food and drinking water.\n\nRemediating contaminated land is difficult \nand expensive, but necessary to clean up \npast pollution. However, local authorities \noften lack the means and tools to manage \nremediation. More than 65\u00a0000 sites have \nbeen remediated in the EU; however, by far, \nmost potentially contaminated sites are still \nleft untouched32.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/science-update/eu-topsoil-copper-concentration-highest-vineyards-olive-groves-and-orchards\f\n\u00a9 Terezie Pol\u00edvkov\u00e1, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nBest solution \u2014 prevention\n\nPrevention remains the most effective and \ncheapest way to ensure healthy soils \u2014 and \ncleaner water and air \u2014 in the long term.

Synthetic chemicals are all around us. Some \nof them, however, can also be very harmful to our health and the environment. How can \nwe limit the negative effects of chemicals that have become a part of our current way \nof\u00a0life?\n\nEvery day, we are surrounded by hundreds \nor thousands of synthetic chemicals. They \nare in our food, clothes, tools, furniture, toys, \ncosmetics and medicines. Our society would \nnot be the same without these substances. \nHowever, despite their usefulness, we know \nmany of these substances can have negative \nimpacts on our health and the environment.\n\nAccording to some estimates, about 6\u00a0% \nof the world\u2019s disease burden \u2014 including \nchronic diseases, cancers, neurological \nand developmental disorders \u2014 and 8\u00a0% \nof deaths can be attributed to chemicals. \nMoreover, these numbers could be growing \nand they take into consideration only a small \nnumber of chemicals whose effect on health \nis well established34.\n\nDangerous cocktails and \n\u2018forever\u00a0chemicals\u2019\n\nMore than 300 million tonnes of chemicals \nwere consumed in the EU in 2018 and \nmore than two thirds of this amount were \nchemicals that are classified as hazardous to \nhealth, according to Eurostat35. Over 20\u00a0000 \n\nindividual chemicals have been registered \nin the EU under the Registration, Evaluation, \nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \n(REACH) Regulation36.\n\nAs these numbers keep growing, it is \nincreasingly difficult to assess all the effects \nthat chemicals have on our health and the \nenvironment case by case. Most studies \nso far have investigated the effects of only \nsingle chemicals and their safe thresholds \nbut people are constantly exposed to \na mixture of chemicals. This combined \nexposure can lead to health effects, even \nif single substances in the mixture do not \nexceed safe levels.\n\nMoreover, persistent chemicals can \naccumulate in human tissues, causing \nnegative health effects after long-term \nexposure. For example, per- and \npolyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS)37 \nare a group of almost 5\u00a0000 widely used \nchemicals that can accumulate over time in \nhumans and in the environment. They are \nan example of persistent organic pollutants \n\u2014 the so-called forever chemicals.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/human/chemicals/emerging-chemical-risks-in-europe\f\n34\n\nPeople are mainly exposed to PFAS through \ndrinking water, food and food packaging, \ndust, cosmetics, PFAS-coated textiles and \nother consumer products. The effects of \nhuman exposure to PFAS include kidney \ncancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, \nliver damage and a series of developmental \neffects affecting fetuses.\n\nUsing PFAS-free products and cooking \nmaterials helps to reduce exposure. General \nand specific guidance on how to find \nPFAS-free alternatives is often provided \nby consumer organisations and national \ninstitutions working on the environment, \nhealth or chemicals.\n\nThe precautionary principle\n\nThe \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 could be translated into everyday words as \u2018better safe \nthan sorry\u2019. It means that, when scientific evidence about something is uncertain, and \nthere are reasonable grounds for concern about harm, decision-makers should err on \nthe side of caution and avoid risks. With chemicals, the development of new substances \noutpaces research on their negative impacts. This is why it is important to proceed \nwith\u00a0caution.\n\nRead more about the precautionary\u00a0principle:\n\u2022 Communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle38.\n\u2022 EEA\u2019s Late lessons from early warnings II39.\n\nEndocrine disruptors\n\nSome chemicals interfere with the \nfunctioning of the body\u2019s hormone \nsystem. Exposure to these so-called \nendocrine disruptors can cause a wide \nvariety of health problems, ranging from \ndevelopmental disorders, obesity and \ndiabetes to infertility in men and mortality \nassociated with reduced testosterone \nlevels. Fetuses, small children and \nteenagers are especially vulnerable to \nendocrine disruptors40.\n\nApproximately 800 substances are known \nor suspected to be endocrine disruptors \nand many of them are present in everyday \n\nproducts, such as metal food cans,  \nplastics, pesticides, food  \nand cosmetics.\n\nEndocrine disruptors include bisphenol A \n(BPA), dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs) and certain types of phthalates. \nPhthalates, for example, are used to soften \nplastic for use in a wide range of consumer \ngoods, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, \ndetergents, air fresheners, lubricating oils, \nfood packaging, clothing, personal care \nproducts and toys.\n\nhttps://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/21676661-a79f-4153-b984-aeb28f07c80a/language-en\f\nDevelopmental effects \naffecting the unborn child\n\nIncreased miscarriage risk\n(i.e. pregnancy loss)\n\nLower birth weight\n\nReduced response \nto vaccines\n\nLow sperm count and mobility\n\nEarly puberty onset\n\nDelayed mammary gland \ndevelopment\n\nObesity\n\nThyroid disease\n\nIncreased cholesterol levels\n\nBreast cancer\n\nInflammatory \nbowel disease\n\n(ulcerative colitis)\n\nKidney cancer\n\nIncreased time to pregnancy\n\nPregnancy induced \nhypertension/pre-eclampsia\n(increased blood pressure)\n\nLiver damage\n\nTesticular cancer\n\nHigh certainty\n\nLower certainty\n\n35\n\nEffects of PFAS on human health\nPer- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of extremely persistent chemicals that are \nused in many consumer products. PFAS are used in products because they can, for example, increase oil \nand water repellence or resist high temperatures. Currently, there are more than 4\u00a0700 different PFAS \nthat accumulate in people and the environment.\n\nSources:  US National Toxicology Program (2016); C8 Health Project Reports (2012); WHO IARC (2017); Barry et al.

Inhaling indoor dust \ncontaminated with phthalates that are \nreleased from plastic products or polyvinyl \nchloride (PVC) furnishings is another. (This\u00a0is \none of the reasons why airing our rooms \nregularly is important.) Children playing with \ntoys that contain these substances are also \nat risk and, since phthalates can also be \nfound in consumer products, such as soaps \nand suntan lotions, exposure can also occur \nthrough the skin.\n\nThe EU has put in place measures to reduce \npeople\u2019s exposure to phthalates by banning \nthe use of some of these substances \nand restricting the use of others in toys, \ncosmetics and food containers. However, \nolder products and furnishings may contain \nphthalates that are now banned, so they are \nstill present in our everyday environment.\n\nMoreover, a recent inspection project \nby the European Chemicals Agency \n(ECHA)42 showed that products imported \nfrom non-EU countries can still contain \nphthalates. China has in recent years put \nin place restrictions on certain phthalates \nin toys and food contact materials but \nrestricted phthalates are still found in many \nproducts imported to the EU from China \nand other, sometimes unknown,\u00a0origins.\n\nConcerted efforts have reduced the \npresence of persistent organic pollutants, \nsuch as dioxins, PCBs and atrazine, in \nEurope\u2019s environment since the 1970s, but \ntheir persistence and the fact that they \naccumulate in the food chain, notably in \nanimal fat, continues to cause concerns43. \nAnother concern is that some substances \nhave been substituted for other, equally \ntoxic chemicals.\n\nRegrettable substitutions\n\nChemicals found to be dangerous have \nsometimes been replaced by other \nsubstances, with a similar structure, \nonly later proven to be just as toxic. \nThese cases are called \u2018regrettable \nsubstitutions\u2019, such as in the case of \nsubstituting bisphenol-A, a chemical \nformerly used in many plastic items \nand in thermal printing paper, with \nbisphenol-S and bisphenol-F44.\n\nhttps://echa.europa.eu/-/inspectors-find-phthalates-in-toys-and-asbestos-in-second-hand-products\f\n~ 500 chemicals\nextensively characterised for \ntheir hazards and exposures\n\n~ 100 000 chemicals\non the market\n\n~ 22 600 chemicals\nwith a use over \n1 tonne per year\n\n~ 4 700 chemicals\nwith a use over\n\n100 tonnes per year\nprioritised in \n\nhazard characterisation\nand evaluation\n\n~ 10 000 chemicals \nfairly well characterised for a\n\n subset of their hazards and exposures\n\n~ 20 000 chemicals\nwith limited characterisation for\n\ntheir hazards and exposures\n\n~ 70 000 chemicals\nwith poor characterisation for\ntheir hazards and exposures \n\nHAZARDS EXPOSURES\n\nRISKS\n\n37\n\nSource: EEA report - The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 202045.\n\nThe unknown territory of chemical risks\nThere are many chemicals on the market and only a small fraction of these have been extensively \nstudied for their risks. Designing safe products with a smaller number of different chemicals is one way \nof reducing potential risks.\n\n37\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer-2020\f\n38 \u00a9 Kai Dahms, Unsplash\n\nThe chemicals we eat\n\nPesticides are another group of chemicals \nthat can harm our health, mostly as a result \nof the consumption of vegetables and \nfruit that have been in contact with them. \nChildren are especially vulnerable, partly \nbecause they eat proportionally more food \nper kilogram of body weight than adults \ndo. Eating organic produce can decrease \nthis pesticide burden but not everyone can \nafford that.\n\nThe EU regulates pesticides under the \nRegulation on Plant Protection Products \nand sets safe limits for pesticide residues \nin food and feed. The latest information \nfrom the European Food Safety Authority \n(EFSA)46 shows that 95.5\u00a0% of food samples \ncollected across the EU in 2018 were \nwithin legal limits. Table grapes and bell \npeppers were among the food products \nthat most frequently exceeded the legal \nlevels of residue. Still, based on the samples \nanalysed, containing both regular and \norganic produce, the probability of European \ncitizens being exposed to dangerous levels \nof pesticide residue is considered low.\n\nNot all chemical substances harmful to \nour health are new. For example, mercury \nis naturally present in the environment \nand has been released in air and water by \nhuman activity for centuries. However, today \nwe know that ingesting mercury can affect \nthe nervous system, kidneys and lungs, and \nexposure during pregnancy can affect the \ndevelopment of the fetus.\n\n38\n\nhttps://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6057\f\n39\n\nPeople are exposed to mercury mainly \nthrough eating large predatory fish, such as \ntuna, shark, swordfish, pike, zander, eel and \nmarlin. This also means that exposure can be \nlimited by dietary choices, which is important \nespecially for vulnerable groups, such as \nexpectant mothers and young children.\n\nFor a more complete picture of human \nexposure to chemicals, there is a need for \ndata on what is in our bodies. This includes \nchemicals that we eat as well as those that \nenter through other exposure pathways. \nThese types of human biomonitoring data \ncan be used to improve chemical risk \nassessments by providing information on \nactual human exposure through multiple \nexposure pathways.\n\nHuman biomonitoring \u2014 measuring our exposure to chemicals\n\nHuman biomonitoring measures people\u2019s exposure to chemicals by analysing the \nsubstances themselves, their metabolites or markers of subsequent health effects \nin urine, blood, hair or tissue. Information on human exposure can be linked to \ndata on sources and epidemiological surveys, in order to inform research on the \nexposure\u2011response relationships in\u00a0humans.\n\nThe European human biomonitoring initiative, HBM4EU47, launched in 2017 and \nco-funded under Horizon 2020, is a joint effort of 30 countries, the EEA and the \nEuropean Commission.\n\nThe main aim of the initiative is to coordinate and advance human biomonitoring in \nEurope. HBM4EU will provide better evidence of the actual exposure of citizens to \nchemicals and the possible health effects to support policymaking. The project has also \nset up focus groups to understand EU citizen\u2019s perspectives on chemical exposure and \nhuman biomonitoring.\n\nUnder HBM4EU, efforts are under way to generate robust and coherent data sets \non the exposure of the European population to chemicals of concern. This includes \nproducing exposure data on 16 substance groups, mixtures of chemicals and \nemerging chemicals, as\u00a0well as exploring exposure pathways and linking exposure to \nhealth\u00a0effects.\n\nVisit: www.hbm4eu.eu\n\nhttps://www.hbm4eu.eu/\f\n40 \u00a9 Sebastian \u0160koi\u0107, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA40\n\f\n41\u00a9 Sebastian \u0160koi\u0107, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 41\n\nChemical effects on nature\n\nSynthetic chemicals released into nature can affect plants and animals. For example, \nneonicotinoids are a type of insecticide used in agriculture to control pests that pose \nrisks to bees, as bees are important pollinators supporting food production. Pesticides \ncan also affect fish and bird populations and entire food chains. In 2013, the European \nCommission severely restricted48 the use of plant protection products and treated \nseeds containing certain neonicotinoids to protect\u00a0honeybees49.\n\nTowards a safer chemical \nenvironment\n\nThe EU has the strictest and most advanced \nrules in the world when it comes to \nchemicals. The REACH Regulation is the \nkey piece of legislation that aims to protect \nhuman health and the environment, \nand the EU has put in place rules for the \nclassification, labelling and packaging \nof\u00a0chemicals50.\n\nThe EU has a body of legislation to regulate \nchemicals in detergents, biocides, plant \nprotection products and pharmaceuticals. \nPolicies limit the use of hazardous chemicals \nin personal care products, cosmetics, \ntextiles, electronic equipment and food \ncontact materials. Limits are also in place \nfor chemicals in the air, food and drinking \nwater. Legislation addresses point source \nemissions from industrial installations and \nfrom urban waste water treatment plants.\n\nStill, there is room for improvement to \ncreate a less toxic environment, and the \nEuropean Green Deal aims to further protect \ncitizens against dangerous chemicals with a \nnew chemicals strategy and by moving the \nEU towards the zero pollution ambition.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Chemicals: www.eea.europa.eu/\nthemes/human/chemicals\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 10 on chemical \npollution: www.eea.europa.eu/\npublications/soer-2020/chapter-10_\nsoer2020-chemical-pollution/view\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_13_708\f\n42\n\nIn\nte\n\nrv\nie\n\nw\n\nProfessor Geert \nVan\u00a0Calster\nUniversity of Leuven\n\n\u00a9 Linz Verendet on Unsplash\n\f\n43\n\nDoes the polluter pay?\nA simple but powerful idea lies at the heart of environmental laws in the EU: the \n\u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle. This principle has been applied in the form of taxes, fines and \nother measures, such as quotas for pollutant emissions and the Environmental Liability \nDirective. We talked to Professor Geert Van Calster about this principle, its benefits \nand\u00a0shortcomings.\n\nWhat is the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 \nprinciple\u00a0about?\n\nThe \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle is a simple \nprinciple based on common sense: the \npolluter \u2014 and this could be the actors or \nthe activity causing the pollution \u2014 should \npay to right the wrong. This could entail \ncleaning up the polluted area or covering the \nhealth costs of the people affected.\n\nHistorically, it has been a very powerful \nconcept to mitigate the negative impacts \nof pollution. It provided a moral and legal \nimperative to take action. In pressing \ncases, it helped formulate policies and \nmeasures, which allowed for decisive action \nto identify pollution sources and their \nliability, reduce pollution levels and provide \nsome compensation to those affected. For \nexample, some economic activities known \nto release pollutants had to install filters \nto reduce pollutant emissions or establish \nsector-wide compensation funds.\n\nBut even in simple cases, where the polluter \ncan be identified, implementation can be \ndifficult. The \u2018culprit\u2019 may be unable to pay \nand the mother corporation or shareholders \ncannot always be held liable for the activities \nof a subsidiary. Not every country has a \n\nwell-established legal framework to handle \nthese cases. Even if they do, a legal process \nis often very lengthy and costly.\n\nMoreover, with time, the principle has \nbeen applied to more complex cases of \npersistent and prevalent pollution, such \nas air pollution resulting from diffuse \nsources, where attributing responsibility and \nimplementation get even more difficult.\n\nHow can we define who needs to \npay whom?\n\nIn diffuse pollution cases, it is not easy to \ntrack and identify the polluter and connect \nit with the people affected. Air pollution \ncan be caused by pollutants released from \ndifferent sources and different locations, \nsome of which may lie across international \nborders. We also need to think about the \npositive outcomes and benefits of these \npolluting activities. These are products and \nservices, such as food, clothes, transport, \nwhich benefit us individually and the society \nas a whole.\n\nFor example, polluting activities outside the \nEU could be affecting local communities but \nthe mother holding could be based in the EU \nand European consumers could be enjoying \n\f\n44 \u00a9 Perry Wunderlich, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nthe products. It is difficult to hold only the \noperator accountable in these cases. The \nwider society often bears the costs.\n\nBut the costs or the harm and the benefits \nare not distributed equally. Lower income \ncommunities or more vulnerable groups \nlike single parent families tend to live closer \nto roads and be more exposed to pollutants \nfrom road transport.\n\nAre there any good examples of \neffective measures?\n\nThere are two different types of \napproaches. The first aims at helping \nthose affected and there are many good \nexamples in Europe. The noise abatement \npanels or similar structures built along \nmotorways can reduce noise levels \nsignificantly and hence the harm to those \nliving there.\n\nThe second type aims at limiting or \npreventing pollution or harmful activities \nin the first place. These could consist of \nimposing taxes, pollution quotas or certain \ntechnological solutions. For example, \nEurope is introducing cleaner fuels or is \ngradually decreasing carbon emissions \nfrom new cars. For some sectors, \nemissions allowances are capped and \ncan be traded. Some of these measures \naim at adjusting the price in such a way \nas to influence consumption behaviour. \nSimilarly, many Member States now charge \nby the quantity extracted or used instead \nof the number of taps, which has changed \nhow we use water substantially.\n\f\n45\n\nAre there any shortcomings in \nthe way we apply the \u2018polluter \npays\u2019\u00a0principle?\n\nUnfortunately, the current system can be \nseen and used as a \u2018licence to pollute\u2019: as \nlong as you can pay \u2014 meaning if you can \nafford it, you are allowed to pollute. This is \nclosely linked to the unequal distribution of \nbenefits and costs of these polluting activities. \nThe inequality issue also lies at the heart of \nglobal climate negotiations, both in terms of \nhistoric emissions (the amount each country \nhas emitted so far) and current emissions per \nperson. In an ideal world, everyone would be \ngiven an equal amount of carbon credit.\n\nThe second main shortcoming is that the \n\u2018payment\u2019 hardly ever covers all the \u2018costs\u2019. \nThe contaminated land in old industrial sites \nmight be cleaned up to allow for people to \nlive there. It is a very costly operation but it \ndoes not necessarily undo the harm done \nto the water bodies or to the people and \nanimals dependent on that water. Costs are \noften limited to operational costs and do not \nreflect the real value of the benefits we get \nfrom nature.\n\nCan we design a system that \ncovers\u00a0the full value?\n\nWe need a coherent and global approach \nthat addresses all the challenges we face \u2014 \nenvironmental degradation, climate change, \nresource use and inequalities \u2014 in the same \nway that the Sustainable Development Goals \ndo. The European Green Deal aims to bring \nsome of this thinking into European policies.\n\nTo cover the real value, we would need a \nmuch more ambitious taxation system, both \nfor corporate and personal tax, designed \nto induce a more sustainable behaviour. \nAnd, costs need to be integrated not only \ndownstream on the consumption side but \nalso upstream on the production side. As \nconsumption and production systems are \nconnected globally, integration requires an \napproach that extends beyond sovereign \nstates\u2019 rules and regulations.\n\nTo be effective, this approach needs to \nbe backed by a governance system with \nregulators that can ensure and enforce a \nlevel playing field with well-defined rules. \nOn the ground, in addition to ambitious \ntaxes and common standards, measures \nlike anti-dumping duties and carbon border \ntaxes as well as a common approach \ntowards environmentally harmful subsidies \nwill be\u00a0necessary.\n\nProfessor Geert Van Calster\nHead of Leuven Law\u2019s department of \nEuropean and international law\nUniversity of Leuven\n\f\n\u00a9 Carolina Pimenta, Unsplash46\n\f\n47\n\nThe challenge of reducing \nindustrial pollution\nIndustrial pollution in Europe is decreasing, thanks to a blend of regulation, developments \nin manufacturing and environmental initiatives. However, industry continues to pollute \nand moving towards zero pollution in this sector is an ambitious challenge.\n\nWe can categorise pollution by where we \nfind it \u2014 in air, water or soil \u2014 or we can \nlook at different pollution types, such as \nchemicals, noise or light. Another way to \nlook at pollution is to go to its sources. \nSome pollution sources are spread out, \nsuch as cars, agriculture and buildings, but \nothers can be better assessed as individual \nemission points. Many of these point \nsources are large installations, such as \nfactories and power plants.\n\nIndustry is a key component of Europe\u2019s \neconomy. According to Eurostat, in 2018, \nit accounted for 17.6\u00a0% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and directly employed \n36\u00a0million people. At the same time, industry \nalso accounts for more than half of the total \nemissions of some key air pollutants and \ngreenhouse gases, as well as other important \nenvironmental impacts, including the release \nof pollutants to water and soil, the generation \nof waste and energy consumption.\n\nAir pollution is often associated with the \nburning of fossil fuels. This obviously applies \nto power plants but also to many other \nindustrial activities that may have their \nown onsite electricity or heat production, \nsuch as iron and steel manufacturing or \ncement production. Some activities generate \ndust that contributes to particulate matter \n\nconcentrations in the air, whereas solvent \nuse, for example in metal processing or \nchemical production, may lead to emissions \nof polluting organic compounds.\n\nIndustrial air emission trends\n\nAir emissions from industry in Europe have \ndecreased over recent years. Between 2007 \nand 2017, overall emissions of sulphur \noxides (SOx) declined by 54\u00a0%, nitrogen \noxides (NOx) by more than one third and \ngreenhouse gases from industry, including \npower plants, by 12\u00a0%51.\n\nThese improvements in environmental \nperformance by European industry \nhave occurred for a number of reasons, \nincluding stricter environmental regulation, \nimprovements in energy efficiency, a \nmove towards less polluting types of \nmanufacturing processes and voluntary \nschemes to reduce environmental impact.\n\nFor many years, environmental regulation \nhas limited the adverse impacts of industrial \nactivities on human health and the \nenvironment. Key EU measures targeting \nindustrial emissions include the Industrial \nEmissions Directive, which covers about \n52\u00a0000 of the largest industrial plants, and \nthe Medium Combustion Plants Directive. \n\f\n48\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading System (EU \nETS), meanwhile, limits greenhouse gas \nemissions from more than 12\u00a0000 power \ngeneration and manufacturing installations \nin 31 countries. The EU ETS covers around \n45\u00a0% of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, despite these improvements, \nindustry is still responsible for a significant \nburden on our environment in terms of \npollution and waste generation.\n\nPublic accountability \u2014 the \nE-PRTR and transparency of \nindustrial emissions data\n\nThe European Pollutant Release and \nTransfer Register (E-PRTR) was set up \nin 2006 to enhance public access to \nenvironmental\u00a0information.\n\nIn essence, the E-PRTR enables citizens and \nstakeholders to learn about pollution in all \ncorners of Europe, who the top polluters \nare and whether or not pollutant emission \ntrends are improving.\n\nThe E\u2011PRTR covers more than 34\u00a0000 \nfacilities across 33 European countries. \nE-PRTR data show, for each facility and \nyear, information concerning the amount \nof pollutants released to air, water and \nland, as well as off-site transfers of waste \nand pollutants in waste water. E-PRTR \ndata are freely available on a dedicated, \ninteractive website52. The website \narchives historical data on releases \nand transfers of 91 pollutants across \n65\u00a0economic\u00a0activities.\n\nMoreover, the E-PRTR is now integrated \nwith wider reporting under the Industrial \nEmissions Directive, including further \ninformation for large combustion plants53. \nTogether with the European Commission, \nthe EEA is currently working on a new \nwebsite to improve access to these data \nand\u00a0information.\n\nCounting the costs of industrial \nair pollution\n\nIn order to account for the external costs \nof air pollution, an individual pollutant\u2019s \nadverse impacts on human health and the \nenvironment are expressed in a common \nmetric, a monetary value, which has been \ndeveloped through cooperation between \ndifferent scientific and economic disciplines.\n\nDamage cost estimates are just that \u2014 \nestimates. However, when considered \nalongside other sources of information, they \ncan support decisions by drawing attention \nto the implicit trade-offs in decision-making, \nsuch as the cost-benefit analyses used \nto inform impact assessments and \nsubsequent\u00a0legislation.\n\nThe EEA estimated in 2014 that the \naggregated cost of damage over the 5-year \nperiod 2008-2012 caused by emissions \nfrom E-PRTR industrial facilities was at least \nEUR\u00a0329 billion (2005 value) and rising54. \nWhat is perhaps even more striking in this \nanalysis is that about half of the damage \ncosts occurred as a result of emissions from \nonly 147, or 1\u00a0%, of the 14\u00a0000 facilities in \nthe\u00a0data set.\n\f\n49\u00a9 Veeterzy, Unsplash\n\nThe majority of the quantified damage \ncosts is caused by emissions of the \nmain air pollutants and carbon dioxide. \nAlthough damage cost estimates \nassociated with heavy metal and organic \npollutant emissions are significantly lower, \nthey still cause hundreds of millions \nof euros in harm to health and the \nenvironment and can cause significant \nadverse impacts on the local scale. The \nEEA is currently working on a new study \nthat will update these\u00a0figures.\n\nReducing industrial pollution \n\u2014 assessment, legislation \nand\u00a0implementation\n\nThe EEA regularly assesses trends in \nindustrial pollution in Europe55 based \non E-PRTR and other data. These \nassessments show that industrial pollution \nhas decreased over the past decade for \nemissions to both air and water. Existing \nand incoming EU policy instruments are \nexpected to further reduce industrial \nemissions, but pollution is likely to \ncontinue to have adverse impacts on \nhuman health and the environment in \nthe\u00a0future.\n\nA strong, growing, low-carbon industry \nbased on circular material flows is part of \nthe EU industrial policy strategy56. The goal \nis to create a growing industrial sector that \ndraws less and less on natural resources, \nreduces pollutant emissions to air, water \nand land, and generates decreasing \namounts of waste.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/ds_resolveuid/IND-446-en\f\n30 Million tonnes (Mt)\nof waste generated in EU (2015)\n\n17 %\ncollected for reuse or recycling (5 Mt)\n\n83 %\nlost (25 Mt)\n57 %\nloss through landfilling and energy recovery\n\nMany other adverse \nenvironmental \nconsequences are \nassociated to the loss\nof plastic materials, \nsuch as  release of \nmicroplastics into the \nenvironment.\n\n1 tonne of plastics \nresults in 2.5 tonnes of \nCO2 emissions from \nproduction and\n2.7 tonnes of CO2 \nemissions if \nincinerated. \n\n+ +\n+ CO2 +\n\nProcess\nlosses in\nrecycling\n\nTypes of plastic waste\n\n16.3 Mt\nplastic\npackaging\nwaste\n\n1-1.5 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom construction\nand demolition \n\n1.2 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom end-of-life\nvehicles\n\n2.4 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom e-waste\n\n50\n\nMeanwhile, other EU legislation sets more \nconcrete air emission reduction targets, \nsuch as the National Emission Ceilings \nDirective57 and the Industrial Emissions \nDirective58, which aim to achieve the \nambitious prevention and reduction \nof emissions, in particular through the \ncontinuous uptake of so-called best \navailable techniques (BATs).\n\nAccording to a recent EEA analysis59, using \nbest available techniques and implementing \nthe more ambitious targets of the \nIndustrial Emissions Directive would result \nin substantial emission reductions: 91\u00a0% \nfor sulphur dioxide, 82\u00a0% for particulate \nmatter and 79\u00a0% for nitrogen oxides. Fully \nimplementing these directives would help \nthe EU achieve environmental objectives, \nsuch as those on air and water quality. \n\nHowever, the emission-related directives \noften act independently and there is \nclear scope for further integration of \nthe environmental objectives into the \nEU\u2019s industrial policy. Moving towards \nzero pollution will require even more \nrobust legislation, implementation and \nmonitoring to ensure that the industries of \ntomorrow are both clean and sustainable.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Industry: www.eea.europa.eu/themes/\nindustry\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 12 on industrial \npollution: www.eea.europa.eu/\npublications/soer-2020/chapter-12_\nsoer2020-industrial-pollution/view\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/reduction/index.htm\f\n30 Million tonnes (Mt)\nof waste generated in EU (2015)\n\n17 %\ncollected for reuse or recycling (5 Mt)\n\n83 %\nlost (25 Mt)\n57 %\nloss through landfilling and energy recovery\n\nMany other adverse \nenvironmental \nconsequences are \nassociated to the loss\nof plastic materials, \nsuch as  release of \nmicroplastics into the \nenvironment.\n\n1 tonne of plastics \nresults in 2.5 tonnes of \nCO2 emissions from \nproduction and\n2.7 tonnes of CO2 \nemissions if \nincinerated. \n\n+ +\n+ CO2 +\n\nProcess\nlosses in\nrecycling\n\nTypes of plastic waste\n\n16.3 Mt\nplastic\npackaging\nwaste\n\n1-1.5 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom construction\nand demolition \n\n1.2 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom end-of-life\nvehicles\n\n2.4 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom e-waste\n\nPlastic pollution\nPlastics have brought many benefits to our daily lives but the problem is that these products never truly \ndisappear.

Loud cars on the street, \na low-flying plane overhead or a nearby train often bring with them annoyance and \nfrustration. However, their impact on our health and environment could be a lot worse \nthan you think.\n\nWe often think about pollution in terms of \nwhere it can be detected: pollution of air, \nwater or soil. However, there are also some \nvery specific types of pollution that harm \npeople and wildlife.\n\nAt least one in five Europeans is currently \nexposed to road traffic noise levels \nconsidered harmful to their health. This \nnumber is even higher in urban areas and \nthe problem is widespread across most \ncities in Europe. Road traffic is by far the \ntop source of noise pollution in Europe, \naccording to a recent EEA noise report61 \nthat looked at noise from roads, railways, \nairports and industry. These sources are in \nline with the Environmental Noise Directive, \nwhich does not cover noise from, for \nexample, domestic activities or neighbours, \nor noise in workplaces.\n\nNoise can be bad for your health\n\nAn estimated 113 million Europeans \nare affected by long-term exposure to \nday-evening-night traffic noise levels of at \n\nleast 55 decibels. In addition, 22 million \nEuropeans are exposed to high levels of \nnoise from railways, 4 million to high levels \nof aircraft noise and fewer than 1 million to \nhigh levels of noise caused by industries.\n\nWhat many people may not know is that \nlong-term exposure to noise, even at the \nlevels we are used to in urban areas, has \nsignificant health impacts. In most European \ncountries, more than 50\u00a0% of people living \nin urban areas are exposed to road noise \nlevels of 55 decibels or higher during \nthe measured day-evening-night period. \nLong-term exposure to this level, according \nto the World Health Organization (WHO), is \nlikely to have negative impacts on health.\n\nThe EEA estimates that long-term exposure \nto environmental noise causes 12\u00a0000 \npremature deaths and contributes to 48\u00a0000 \nnew cases of ischaemic heart disease every \nyear across Europe. It is also estimated \nthat 22 million people suffer chronic high \nannoyance and 6.5 million people suffer \nchronic high sleep disturbance.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-noise-in-europe\f\n54\n\nAccording to WHO evidence, these \nhealth impacts start to occur even below \nthe 55\u00a0decibel noise level for the day\u2011\nevening-night period and the 50 decibel \nnoise level for the night period, which are \nthe reporting thresholds set out by the \nEU\u2019s Environmental Noise Directive62. \n\nTherefore, these numbers are likely to \nbe underestimated. Furthermore, the \ninformation provided by countries under \nEU law do not cover all urban areas, \nroads, railways and airports, nor do they \ncover all sources of noise.\n\n What the EU is doing to reduce noise pollution\n\nPeople\u2019s exposure to noise is monitored under the Environmental Noise Directive \nagainst two reporting thresholds: an indicator for the day-evening-night period (Lden), \nwhich measures exposure to noise levels associated with \u2018annoyance\u2019, and an indicator \nfor the night period (Lnight), which is designed to assess sleep disturbance. These \nreporting thresholds are higher than the World Health Organization-recommended \nvalues and currently there is no mechanism in place for tracking progress against the \nlatter lower\u00a0values.\n\nWildlife is affected too\n\nNoise also has a negative impact on wildlife, \nboth on land and in the water. Noise \npollution can cause a range of physical and \nbehavioural effects on animals and increase \ntheir stress.\n\nFor instance, road traffic noise can make \nit difficult for frogs and songbirds to \ncommunicate with each other, especially \nduring mating season. This can reduce their \nability to reproduce or force them to flee \ntheir habitats.\n\nUnderwater noise from shipping, energy \nproduction, construction and other activities \nis another concern. For example, research \nhas found hearing damage in whales, which \ncan harm their ability to communicate with \neach other and find food.\n\nShh! Quiet please!\n\nEuropean countries have taken a number of \nmeasures to reduce and manage noise levels. \nHowever, it has been difficult to evaluate their \nbenefits in terms of positive health outcomes, \naccording to the EEA\u2019s noise report.\n\nExamples of the most popular measures to \nreduce noise levels in cities include replacing \nolder paved roads with smoother asphalt, \nbetter management of traffic flows and \nreducing speed limits to 30 kilometres per \nhour. Some cities have also implemented \nprojects aimed at masking traffic noise by \nplacing more pleasant-to-the-ear noises, \nsuch as running waterfalls, in city centres. \nThere are also measures aimed at raising \nawareness and changing people\u2019s behaviour \nin using less-noisy modes of transport, such \nas cycling, walking and electric vehicles.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/noise/directive.htm\f\n\u00a9 M\u00e1t\u00e9 Ladj\u00e1nszki, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 55\n\f\n56\n\nA number of cities and regions have also \nput in place so-called quiet areas, most of \nwhich are parks and other green spaces, \nwhere people can go to escape city noise. \nThese areas, the creation and designation \nand protection of which are encouraged by \nEU rules, can bring significant environmental \nand health benefits, according to a 2016 EEA \nreport on quiet areas in Europe63.\n\nHowever, EEA research found issues related \nto the availability of and access to these \nsites, especially in noisier city centres, where \nquiet green spaces are hard to find and not \nreachable within a 10-minute walk from \npeople\u2019s homes.\n\nCOVID-19 and noise\n\nNoise pollution from transport sources, such as road, rail or air traffic, is linked to \neconomic activity. Therefore, a significant short-term reduction in transportation \nnoise levels can be expected as a result of COVID-19-related lockdowns. However, \nenvironmental noise levels are reported over a prolonged period, as health effects \nappear when exposure is long term. As such, a short-term reduction in noise levels \nwould not significantly reduce the annual noise level indicator used to measure the \neffects of noise.\n\nFind out more: https://www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore64.\n\nTurn down the volume\n\nIt is clear that we cannot live without sound \nor noise and reducing noise pollution to \n\u2018zero\u2019 is unrealistic. However, the EU is \nworking to make sure that noise levels \nare reduced so they do less harm to our \nenvironment and health. This is a big task.\n\nIt is already clear that the EU\u2019s 2020 \nobjective on reducing noise pollution, as \ndefined by the EU\u2019s 7th Environment Action \nProgramme65 of decreasing noise pollution \nand moving towards WHO-recommended \nlevels for noise exposure, will not be met. \n\nMany EU Member States will need to do \nmore to take the steps needed to address \nnoise pollution, especially in implementing \nthe EU\u2019s Environmental Noise Directive.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Noise: www.eea.europa.eu/themes/\nhuman/noise\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 11 on \nenvironmental noise: www.eea.europa.\neu/publications/soer-2020/chapter-11_\nsoer2020-environmental-noise/view\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/quiet-areas-in-europe\f\n20 % of the EU population \u2014 one in five people \u2014 live in areas where noise \nlevels are considered harmful to health. \n\nHigh\nannoyance\n\nImpacts of environmental noise in Europe\n\n22 000 000\n\nHigh sleep\ndisturbance\n\n6 500 000\n\nPremature\nmortality\n\n12 000\n\nHeart\ndisease\n\n48 000 Cognitive\nimpairment in \n\n12 500\n\nchildren\n\nNoise pollution\nNoise pollution is a growing environmental concern.

We talked about \npollution and health with Francesca Racioppi, Head of the WHO European Centre for \nEnvironment and Health.\n\nWhat are the most dangerous kinds \nof pollution and their health impacts \naffecting Europeans and their \nhealth\u00a0impacts?\n\nIn Europe (meaning the 53 Member States of \nthe WHO Regional Office for Europe \u2014 more \nthan 900 million people), environmental \nrisk factors still account for 1.4 million \ndeaths per year and these deaths are to \na large extent preventable. More than a \nthird of these deaths are attributable to air \npollution, which is the single most important \nenvironmental risk factor for our health. \nAnother big proportion of pollution harm \ncomes from hazardous chemicals. And, \nunfortunately, every day seven people, \nmostly children, die from diarrhoeal-related \ndiseases so even water quality remains a \nproblem. Even within the EU, in some rural \nareas, we have not yet achieved 100\u00a0% \naccess to clean water and sanitation.\n\nWe still have a long way to go with \nenvironment and health but we can also \nbe very clever in the way we join different \nagendas. For example, addressing air \nquality can mean addressing climate change \nemissions at the same time.\n\nHow did the effects of pollution \non health change in Europe in the \npast\u00a0decades?\n\nIn Europe, the situation has improved \nsignificantly. I was young at the time \nwhen the first legislations were brought \ninto place to fight the acid rains and the \neutrophication of lakes and seawater. \nWe were perhaps the first in some \nindustrial developments that were very \nproblematic and we were also the first \nto be confronted with massive pollution \nand we had to deal with that. We have \nlearned that you need common rules \nto deal with pollution because it knows \nno\u00a0borders.\n\nOf course, now we live in a globalised \nworld and we have to acknowledge that \npollution does not respect continental \nborders either. We have seen some \nissues moving from Europe to other \nregions where some dangerous \nindustrial practices are still allowed, \nso we have a responsibility that goes \nbeyond Europe, a responsibility for \nglobal health and that our policies \nsupport cleaner production.\n\f\n60\n\nDoes air pollution \ninfluence\u00a0the evolution of the \nCOVID\u201119\u00a0pandemic?\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions \nregarding the relation between air quality \nand COVID-19 and it is a topic of current \nscientific investigation. However, there \nare some statements that we can already \nmake. Improving air quality would never \nbe wrong because we know that air \npollution is an important risk factor for and \ncause of respiratory and cardiovascular \ndiseases. People who have these underlying \nconditions have shown increased \nvulnerability to COVID-19 and are at a \nhigher risk of reporting severe\u00a0symptoms.\n\nIn the short term, we have seen an \nimportant reduction of air pollution across \ncities. This reduction is more prominent in \nthe case of nitrogen oxides, a pollutant very \nmuch related to traffic, which is one of the \nactivities most affected by the lockdown \nmeasures. There is a lot of research that \nis going on around this as we are speaking \nand from which we will learn and benefit \nin the future. COVID-19 is an unfolding \ntragedy but, at the same time, it has given \nus a glimpse at unprecedented data that \ncould perhaps help us rethink the way to a \n\u2018new normal\u2019 that can deliver environmental \nand health\u00a0benefits.\n\nCan this crisis be a push towards a \nsustainable economy?\n\nIt is excellent that the European Commission \nhas been working on the European Green \nDeal because it is a very strong commitment \nthat can give a huge leverage to frame the \n\nrecovery in a sustainable manner. There is \nan unprecedented opportunity for this \u2018new \nnormal\u2019 to be a leap towards sustainable \neconomic development and we are \nlooking forward to working towards that in \ncollaboration with the Commission.\n\nWhat would be the easiest methods \nto decrease pollution?\n\nIf we focus on the example of air pollution, we \nneed to address the sectors where it originates \n\u2014 the energy sector, transport, agriculture, \nwaste management and many industries \u2014 \nworking from local to global scales. A lot has \nbeen done over the past decades, but we still \nsee that globally, 90\u00a0% of people are living \nin cities that do not meet WHO\u2019s air quality \nguideline values. This means that we still have \na significant way to go that requires working \nwith the different sectors to see how we can \npromote cleaner and safer transportation \nsystems, for example. For all sectors there are \npositive ways forward.\n\nI think it is also important to acknowledge \nthat the effects of pollution in general, \nand of air pollution in particular, are not \nequally distributed. People who live in more \ndeprived areas, very often live close to \ncontaminated sites or in areas where there \nis a very high flow of traffic. The differences \ncan be large, not only between countries, \nbut also within countries.\n\nWhat is WHO Europe doing in the \nfield of environment and pollution?\n\nFor more than 30 years, our core mission, \nas WHO, is to work with our Member States \nand within countries to support them in \n\f\n61\n\naddressing their environment and health \npriorities. This came up very clearly at the \nlast European Ministerial Conference on \nEnvironment and Health that took place in \nOstrava in 2017. All 53 Member States came \ntogether and agreed to develop national \nportfolios for action on environment and \nhealth. We are at their side, supporting \nthem in identifying the national priorities, \nand then supporting the work in that \ndirection.\n\nAlso, we are continuing the normative work \nof the WHO: our Centre is coordinating \nthe update of the WHO global air quality \nguidelines. Last year we launched the WHO \nenvironmental noise guidelines, providing \npublic health-oriented recommendations \nto support legislation and policymaking for \nstandards in our Member States and at the \nEuropean level.\n\nDo you expect the new WHO \nguidelines regarding noise and the \nforthcoming update on air pollution \nto be adopted by the EU as well?\n\nI hope so. The WHO guidelines provide \nrobust recommendations based on the \n\nmost updated scientific evidence of what \nwe know of the relationship between \nhealth and air pollution or environmental \nnoise. From that point it is a political \ndecision whether to refer to those \nguideline values when setting standards. \nWe know that the European Commission \nrefers frequently to WHO guidelines. For \nexample, the EU Drinking Water Directive \nwas revised based on the health-based \nrecommendations and guideline values in \nthe latest edition of the WHO guidelines \nfor drinking-water quality. Environmental \nnoise guidelines for the European region \nare considered in the revision of the \nEnvironmental Noise Directive. The \ndebate remains open when it comes to \nthe forthcoming update of the global air \nquality guidelines on how they will be \nreflected in European Union policies. We \nhave to respect the political process and \nthe deliberations of the EU and its Member \nStates but we hope that those policies will \npromote and protect health, and we are \nhere to support them.\n\nFrancesca Racioppi\nHead of the WHO European Centre for \nEnvironment and Health\n\f\nExamples of applications\n\nCopernicus, the EU earth \nobservation programme,\nis delivering unprecedented \namounts of environmental and \nclimate data.

The contribution of this source \n\ncategory to the total emissions of dioxins and furans is reported to be 0.2 % (Oslo and Paris \n\nCommission \u2013 Environmental Regulations for the European Community (Osparcom)-Helsinki \n\nCommission \u2013 Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (Helcom)-United Nations \n\nEconomic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Emission Inventory). Crematoria also have the potential \n\nto emit polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), but are unlikely to release significant emissions of \n\nother persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (European Topic Centre on Air Emissions (ETC/AEM)\nCITEPA-RISOE 1997). \n\n2 Description of sources \n\n2.1 Process description \n\nThere are two main types of crematoria depending on the type of support fuel: \n\n\uf0b7 crematoria using gas or oil as support fuel; \n\n\uf0b7 crematoria using electricity as the support fuel. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-1 Flow diagram of the cremation process showing activities included in this \n\nchapter \n\n \n\nStart up fuel\n\n(Natural Gas\n\nor Fuel Oil)\n\nCrematory\n\nPrimary\n\nIncineration\n\nChamber\n\nCrematory\n\nSecondary\n\nCombustion\n\nChamber\n\nEmissions to\n\nAtmosphere\n\nAshes to\n\nDisposal\n\nOperating Fuel\n\n(Natural Gas\n\nor Fuel Oil)\n\nBody and \n\nCasket\n\n1.A 6.D\n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 4 \n\n \n\nCrematories are usually designed with a primary and a secondary combustion chamber (see Figure \n\n2-1). The crematories are usually single-ended units which process one coffin at a time. The coffin is \n\nplaced inside the primary chamber of the crematory at a temperature of about 300\u2013800 \u00b0C. The \n\nprimary chamber is only preheated by the previous cremation. The secondary chamber, however, is \n\npreheated by the support fuel to about 850 \u00b0C. This chapter does not cover the emissions from pre\nheating. \n\nThe primary chamber has burners that are played on the coffin and air lances to break up the \n\nremains and promote combustion. The combustion gases from the primary chamber are then fed \n\nby a series of ducts into the compartmentalised secondary chamber, which is heated with \n\nafterburners and supplied with secondary air to complete combustion and reduce the emissions of \n\ncarbon-based particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and POPs. The secondary \n\nchamber has a residence time for the gases of one to two seconds. \n\nThe cremation process begins by placing the body into a specialised cremation casket or cremation \n\ncontainer that must be combustible, closed, and resistant to the escape of bodily fluids. The \n\ncontainers may be cardboard, fibreboard, cloth covered fibreboard, or traditional finished wood. \n\nThis container, with the body enclosed in it, is placed inside the primary cremation chamber.  \n\nAll substances are incinerated and vaporized except for some bone fragments and any non\ncombustible materials such as prostheses, jewellery, metal hinges, nails, etc. The skeletal framework \n\nis reduced to bone fragments and particles (not ashes), called cremated remains. \n\nThe time required for the cremation to be completed may vary depending upon the type of cremator \n\nand the weight and the size of the person. Generally, cremation time takes between 1.5 and 5 hours, \n\nincluding the cooling period. The cremated remains will weigh approximately four to eight pounds.  \n\nFollowing the cooling period the cremated remains are removed from the chamber using special \n\nbrushes, rakes, and other equipment. Every effort is made to remove all cremated remains. A small \n\nresidue may remain inside the cremation chamber and may result in unintentional combining with \n\nother cremated remains from previous cremations. All non-combustible matter is separated and \n\nremoved from the bone fragments by visible and/or magnetic separation. This non-combustible \n\nmatter will be disposed of by the crematorium in a non-recoverable manner. The bone particles \n\nremoved from the chamber vary in size and shape and may be mechanically processed to reduce \n\nthem to a manageable consistency for placement into an urn (Kubasak, 1996). \n\nAshes are generally mechanically processed to have a more uniform texture and appearance. The \n\nincidental fugitive emissions from this processing are negligible. \n\n \n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 5 \n\n \n\nFigure 2-2 Process scheme for source category 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 Techniques \n\nCremation technology is discussed in (preceding) subsection 2.1 of the present chapter. \n\n2.3 Emissions and controls \n\nThe major emissions from crematories are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, \n\nparticulate matter, mercury, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), other heavy \n\nmetals, and some POPs. The emission rates depend on the design of the crematory, combustion \n\ntemperature, gas retention time, duct design, duct temperature and any control devices. \n\nParticulates such as dust, soot, ash and other unburned particles originate from the cremation \n\ncontainer, human remains, and other contents of the container. Carbon-based organic particulates \n\nshould be removed in the secondary combustion chamber and through proper adjustment and \n\noperation of the cremation equipment. \n\nCarbon monoxide results from the incomplete combustion of the container, human remains, fuel, \n\nand other contents. Carbon monoxide may be minimised through proper adjustment and operation \n\nof the cremation equipment. \n\nSulphur dioxide is produced from the combustion of fossil fuels, container, and contents. The \n\nsulphur content of natural gas and human remains is low, but other fuels may contain a significant \n\nportion of sulphur. \n\nNitrogen oxides are formed by high temperature combustion processes through the reaction of the \n\nnitrogen in air with oxygen. Nitrogen oxide emissions from crematories are low and are not of major \n\nIncineration\n\nChamber\nBody and\n\nCasket\n\nF\nu\n\ne\nl\n\nAshes to\n\ndisposal\n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 6 \n\n \n\nconcern. Control of nitrogen oxides can be achieved through temperature control and burner \n\ndesign. \n\nMercury emissions originate from the dental fillings that may contain 5 to 10 grams of mercury \n\ndepending on the numbers and types used. Mercury may be removed through the use of selenium \n\nsalt in the cremation chamber (Hogland W., 1994) or scrubbers. It should be noted that in some \n\ncountries the use of plastic or other types of fillings are gaining popularity which will reduce the \n\nmercury emissions. \n\nNMVOCs are produced from incomplete or inefficient combustion of hydrocarbons contained in the \n\nfuels, body, and casket. NMVOCs are reduced through the proper use and adjustment of the \n\ncrematory. \n\nDioxins and furans result from the combustion of wood cellulose, chlorinated plastics, and the \n\ncorrect temperature range. Dioxins and furans may be reduced through reduction in the chlorinated \n\nplastics and with sufficiently high temperature and residence time in the secondary combustion \n\nchamber. Reformation of dioxins and furans can be avoided by good design of the flue-gas ducts, by \n\nreducing particulate deposition and avoiding the dioxin and furan reformation temperature window. \n\nMost contaminants except for the heavy metals can be minimised through the proper operation of \n\nthe crematory in conjunction with adequate temperature and residence time in the secondary \n\ncombustion chamber. Sulphur oxide may be minimised through the use of low sulphur fuels such \n\nas natural gas. \n\nHeavy metals except for mercury may be removed through particulate control devices. Mercury can \n\nbe removed by adding activated carbon to the particulate control devices e.g. bag filters. \n\nEmissions may be further reduced through the use of different types of containers such as \n\nfibreboard and cloth-covered fibreboard instead of the traditional finished wood. \n\nWith respect to incineration of animal carcasses, the disposal of animal carcasses by methods such \n\nas to a licensed incinerator or landfill site is likely to cause significantly less pollution. \n\n3 Methods \n\n3.1 Choice of method \n\nFigure 3-1 presents the procedure to select the methods for estimating emissions from cremation. \n\nAn equivalent decision tree is applicable to determine emissions for animal carcass incineration. The \n\nbasic idea is: \n\n\uf0b7 if detailed information is available, use it; \n\n\uf0b7 if the source category is a key category, a Tier 2 or better method must be applied and detailed \n\ninput data must be collected. The decision tree directs the user in such cases to the Tier 2 \n\nmethod, since it is expected that it is more easy to obtain the necessary input data for this \n\napproach than to collect facility-level data needed for a Tier 3 estimate; \n\n\uf0b7 the alternative of applying a Tier 3 method, using detailed process modelling, is not explicitly \n\nincluded in this decision tree. However, detailed modelling will always be done at facility level \n\nand results of such modelling could be seen as \u2018facility data\u2019 in the decision tree. \n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 7 \n\n \n\nThis chapter only provides a Tier 1 approach for estimating emissions from cremation. Some Tier 2 \n\nemission factors are provided for animal carcass incineration.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3-1 Decision tree for source category 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 Tier 1 default approach \n\n3.2.1 Algorithm \n\nThe simpler methodology relies on the use of a single emission factor for each pollutant species, \n\ncombined with activity statistics. The general equation can be written as: \n\npollutantproductionpollutant EFARE \uf0b4\uf03d  (1) \n\nThis equation uses the cremation activity statistics and the Tier 1 emission factors, provided in the \n\nnext section. \n\nThe Tier 1 emission factors assume an averaged or typical technology and abatement \n\nimplementation in the country. In cases where specific abatement options are to be taken into \n\naccount, a Tier 1 method is not applicable and a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach must be used. \n\n \n\nStart\n\nFacility data\n\nAvailable?\n\nAll cremation\n\ncovered\n\nUse Tier 3\n\nFacility data\n\nonly\n\nTechnology \n\nStratification\n\navailable?\n\nUse Tier 2\n\ntechnology specific \n\nactivity data \n\nand EFs\n\nKey source?\n\nGet \n\ntechnology stratified \n\nactivity data \n\nand EFs\n\nApply Tier 1\n\ndefault EFs\n\nYes Yes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nUse Tier 3\n\nFacility data &\n\nextrapolation\n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 8 \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Default emission factors \n\nTable 3-1 presents the Tier 1 default emission factors for cremation for various pollutants from \n\ncrematory stacks for the cremation of a single body and the container. These emission factors have \n\nbeen derived from all available data and information, taking into account the results of an \n\nassessment of emissions factors included in the earlier versions of the Guidebook. Most of the \n\ninformation on the emission factors for this source category is from the US Environmental Protection \n\nAgency emission factor database \u2018WebFIRE\u2019. Information for NOx, CO, NMVOC and SOx is from an \n\nearlier Guidebook version taken from US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, 1996) and CANA \n\n(1993). Information for PCBs and HCB has been included in the assessment as well. \n\nWhere information is available from more than one source, there appear to be large differences in \n\nemission factors for some pollutants between the sources, especially PCDD/F is available by many \n\nsources and in many different magnitudes. These differences may be attributed to different fuels, \n\ndesign characteristics, or due to the limited testing performed to derive the emission factors. \n\nThe emission factors are based on a 55\u201370 kg body, about 65 kg on average and are for the \n\nuncontrolled cremation. Emission factors from US EPA taken from the earlier version of the \n\nGuidebook include a 2 kg cardboard and 1 kg wood container, the same applies for US EPA WebFIRE. \n\nCANA emission factors are averaged from test data in report for cardboard, cloth-covered and \n\nfinished wood containers. \n\nEmissions associated with fuel combustion during the cremation are also included in the emission \n\nfactors. The fuel basis for the cremation emission factors from both the US EPA and CANA are \n\nassumed to be natural gas. Emission factors from WebFire (1992) are based on tests from a propane\nfired crematorium. \n\nThere is a very high uncertainty in the emission factors from cremation, which is affected by: \n\n\uf0b7 the high variability in the operating temperatures; \n\n\uf0b7 the residence time in the secondary combustion chamber; \n\n\uf0b7 the fuels used (fuel oils in Sweden, natural gas in North America). \n\nLarge uncertainties and differences may also be caused by different fuels, design characteristics or \n\ndue to the limited testing performed to derive the emission factors. Especially emissions of mercury \n\ncan show extremely high variations. \n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 9 \n\n \n\nTable 3-1 Tier 1 emission factors for source category 5.C.1.b.v Cremation, cremation of \n\nhuman bodies \n\nTier 1 default emission factors \n\n  Code Name \n\nNFR Source Category 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\nFuel NA \n\nNot applicable HCH, NH3 \n\nNot estimated BC \n\nPollutant Value Unit \n\n95% confidence \n\ninterval \n\nReference Lower Upper \n\nNOx 0.825 kg/body 0.0825 8.25 Santarsiero et al.

Refinements to the Tier 1 emission factors can be carried out using individual \n\nactivity statistics (number of bodies cremated), fuel information (quantity and type), control devices, \n\ncrematory design and types of containers incinerated. Emission testing information can be applied \n\nand prorated to other similarly designed crematoriums based on the activity statistics for the \n\nfacilities.  \n\nThis method involves obtaining information in increasing detail from the following list: \n\n\uf0b7 activity statistics for each crematorium/crematory, \n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 12 \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 design information (operating temperature, control devices, etc.) on the crematory or \n\ncrematories, \n\n\uf0b7 fuel types and quantities used, and impurities (heavy metals), \n\n\uf0b7 numbers and types of containers incinerated, \n\n\uf0b7 emission testing information. \n\nIt is good practice to use the Tier 1 emission factors with the crematory-specific activity data. \n\nEmissions testing data will supersede the use of emission factors. It is good practice to use control \n\ndevice information (type, contaminant removal efficiency) in conjunction with emissions testing data \n\nor emission factors to enhance the quality of the emissions estimation. \n\n4 Data quality \n\n4.1 Completeness \n\nCare should be taken to include emissions from waste incineration either in this source category, or \n\nin the relevant 1.A combustion chapter. It is good practice to check if this is indeed the case. \n\n4.2 Avoiding double counting with other sectors \n\nCare should be taken not do double count emissions from waste incineration. It is good practice to \n\ncheck that emissions not included in this source category (because the heat from the incineration is \n\nrecovered and the waste is subsequently used as a fuel) are reported in the relevant 1.A combustion \n\nchapter. \n\n4.3 Verification \n\n4.3.1 Best Available Technique emission factors \n\nNo specific document is available describing the Best Available Techniques for cremation. However, \n\nthe IPPC Reference Document on Best Available Techniques on Waste Incineration (European \n\nCommission, 2006) may be used for reference. \n\n4.4 Developing a consistent time series and recalculation \n\nNo specific issues. \n\n4.5 Uncertainty assessment \n\n4.5.1 Emission factor uncertainties \n\nEmission factors have a very high uncertainty, due to the limited testing data available. Uncertainties \n\nare also affected by a high variability in operating temperature (650\u2013870 \u00b0C), the residence time in \n\nthe secondary combustion chamber and the fuel used. \n\nEmissions of mercury are directly related to the number and types of dental filling present in the \n\nbody incinerated. Metal fittings and fastenings on the caskets can affect the emissions of other heavy \n\nmetals. \n\f\n 5.C.1.b.v Cremation \n\n \n\n EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2019 13 \n\n \n\n4.5.2 Activity data uncertainties \n\nNo specific issues. \n\n4.6 Inventory quality assurance/quality control QA/QC \n\nNo specific issues. \n\n4.7 Gridding \n\nCrematoria are mainly found in larger cities; therefore the emissions may be prorated using \n\npopulation statistics. \n\n4.8 Reporting and documentation \n\nNo specific issues. \n\n5 Glossary \n\nCrematory The incineration unit within a crematorium in which the bodies are incinerated and the \n\nsecondary combustion chamber in the context of this document. \n\nCrematorium The facility which contain the crematory(ies). \n\nCremation chamber The first chamber within the crematory in which the body is incinerated. \n\nHeavy metals Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, zinc. \n\nPOPs Persistent organic pollutants which include dioxins and furans, PAHs (benzo(a)pyrene, \n\nbenzo(k)fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, PCBs (Nos 126, 169, 77, 118, 105, 123, \n\n114, 156, 157, 167, 189), hexachlorobenzene, . \n\nSecondary chamber A second chamber usually containing an afterburner into which exhaust gases from \n\nthe cremation chamber are fed for odour, PM, and VOC control. \n\nToxic equivalency (TEQ or I-TEQ) A prioritisation system of the major toxic isomers based on the toxicity \n\nof the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin isomer to allow for the calculation of dioxin \n\nand furan emissions in terms of the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin isomer. \n\n \n\n6 References \n\nCremation Association of North America (CANA) (1993).

\nclassification was organised by the European Environment Agency and its European Topic Centre \non Biological Diversity with support from the European Topic Centre on Inland, Coastal and \nMarine Waters to further discuss the proposed revision of level 3 of the classification, to help \nclarify the discriminating factors used at level 3 in order to proceed with the revision throughout \n2021, and to discuss further biotic and abiotic discriminating factors to be used at level 4. \n\nThe main driver of inviting further discussions was the response to the Eionet and expert \nconsultation on the initial proposal held in May & June of 2019. The respondents indicated that \nfurther clarification and revision of level 3 was needed as well as on how biological communities \nwould be addressed in the revision. An NRC EIONET webinar was held on December 8th 2020 \nwith the aim to further explain the revision, provide examples of where biological communities \nfit in the system and also to get more information from the Eionet countries. The outcomes of \nthese discussions, along with the comments received during the 2019 consultation, were used \nas the basis of the expert workshop held on March 16th 2021. \n\nA list of experts covering areas of inland water expertise needed to answer questions or fill in \ngaps in the revision, was compiled. These areas concern expertise in particular habitats and \nbiological communities and the Habitats Directive and/or the Water Framework Directive or \nboth. Eventually, 18 external experts, apart from the organising team were available to \nparticipate in the workshop. These experts come from 12 countries and 16 different universities \nand national environmental agencies across Europe, spanning most geographical regions. \n\n \n\nThe workshop was divided into 3 parts: \n\nSession 1 consisted of a series of presentations to set the context of both the revision and the \nday ahead. The structure of the EUNIS habitat classification and the inland waters group in \nparticular was presented. The Broad Types derived from the national types established for the \nWater Framework Directive were described. The background to the EUNIS inland water habitats \nrevision was presented along with more detailed level examples and data sources to extract \nbiological information. \n\nSession 2 focussed on standing waters and presented both the main questions to be answered \nand proposals for solutions. The topics for discussion centred on the Level 3 abiotic factors, \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 5 \n\nadditional abiotic factors for Level 4, missing types, the distinction of the Mediterranean region, \nthe approach for descriptions of biological communities at level 4 and crosslinking to other \nhabitat typologies. \n\nSession 3 focussed on running waters and described dynamics of running waters and the \ncrosslinking of running waters to other habitat typologies. The topics for discussion were the \nmain abiotic factors at Level 3, the position of \u2018flow\u2019 and other factors in the proposed structure, \nhow to define level 4 and lower levels, the distinction of the Mediterranean region, the \nplacement of floodplains and braided rivers in the wider EUNIS system, how to represent the \ndynamics of river systems in the proposed structure and the description of biological \ncommunities in running waters. \n\n \n\nIn general, new ideas and concepts were discussed in terms of alternative or additional \ndiscriminating factors at both levels 3 and 4 which may be more appropriate or provide added \nvalue. In some cases, it was found that suggested factors (e.g. Environmental Zones) were a \ncombination of discriminating factors already incorporated at level 3, or others (e.g. stream \npower) were based on localised data and modelling which could not be extrapolated to a \nEuropean scale within the scope of this revision. However, these factors may be captured at \nlevel 4 in the proposed system i.e. region or Environmental Zones can be captured if needed and \na current proposed system of describing riffles, runs and pools at level 4 captures elements of \nflow and stream power.  It was acknowledged that these factors could be considered for a future \nrevision of the system. \n \nFor standing waters, it was mainly concluded that ponds/pools would be included as a separate \ngroup at level 3 due to their size and importance to regional biodiversity, timberline would be \nused instead of treeline to distinguish between mid- to high altitude lakes and altitude and \nlatitude would act as a proxy for temperature. Geology as a discriminating factor at level 3 \nreflects the natural trophic status of the water bodies due to the relationship between geology \n(alkalinity) and trophic status. There is no need to incorporate region/biogeographic region as a \ndiscriminating factor at Level 3, since the distinctive factors (e.g. salinity, temporary hydroperiod \nfor Mediterranean standing waters) are already set at level 3. Helophyte habitats will be \nincluded in the wetland habitat group, but will be associated with the descriptions of aquatic \nhabitats at level 4, when and where they occur. Isoetid communities (Littorelletea) are \nconsidered aquatic. Marl lakes/karstic lakes will be identified as a separate habitat type at L3. \n\n \n\nFor running waters, more thought and discussion is needed as to where and how \u2018flow\u2019 is \nincorporated into the structure. The current reference to flow is at level 4 with the description \nof pools, riffles and runs. Region/biogeographic region does not need to be distinguished at level \n3, floodplains and braided rivers will be considered as complexes and will be included as such in \nthe inland water habitat group. \n\n1 Introduction \n\nThe EUNIS habitat classification is a comprehensive and extensive pan-European reference \nsystem to harmonize and facilitate the description and collection of data across Europe through \nthe use of criteria for habitat identification (Davies and Moss 1999; Davies et al. 2004; Moss \n2008, Rodwell et al. 2018). It is hierarchical, as shown below (Fig. 1), and covers all types of \nhabitats from natural to artificial, from terrestrial to freshwater and marine. It aims to \naccommodate habitat types, ranging from highly aggregated types at the European level (Levels \n1 to 3) to more detailed types identified at the regional and national levels (Levels 4 and lower).  \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 6 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1. Indicative example of hierarchical structure of EUNIS habitat classification \n\nSince its creation, EUNIS has undergone only modest change, but the increasing need to support \nEuropean policy on nature conservation with harmonised habitat descriptions ideally underpinned \nby field data led to an initiation in 2012 of an extensive review of the EUNIS habitat classification. \nFor the approaches used to revise EUNIS habitats see Box 1. Habitat groups have been addressed \none by one since then including consultations with EIONET and external experts. Some revised \ngroups have been published in Chytr\u00fd et al. 2020. Whereas a floristic approach was considered \nappropriate for terrestrial EUNIS habitats, which are largely defined by their vegetation, it was \nagreed that a different approach was required for the marine and freshwater habitats. \n\n \n\nFor terrestrial habitats, the revised EUNIS habitat classification makes extensive use of \nphytosociological data, which are available from initiatives such as the European Vegetation \nArchive (EVA, Chytr\u00fd et al. 2016, http://euroveg.org/eva-database). Such data can be also useful \nfor inland water types as can be seen below (Fig. 2). Relev\u00e9s for standing (18 170) and running \n(8 847) waters, as well as helophyte vegetation (46 328) from the littoral zone are included and \navailable in the EVA database. \n\n \n\n               \nFigure 2. Relev\u00e9s for standing and running waters (left) and helophytes (right), extracted from \nthe EVA November 30th 2020. 18,170 for standing and 8,847 for running waters, as well as \n46,328 relev\u00e9s for helophyte vegetation in the littoral zone \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 7 \n\nHowever, as many typologies of rivers and lakes in Europe do not use floristics as the main \ndiscriminating factor, it was decided to look into other existing European typologies that could \nbe used as the starting point, such as the Water Frame Directive types, which are based on a \nlimited number of abiotic discriminating factors (Lyche Solheim et al. 2019). As a broad typology \nderived from the WFD common intercalibration types for lakes and rivers was also being \ndeveloped (ETC-ICM 2015, Lyche Solheim et al. 2019), it was decided to investigate the potential \nfor aligning those Broad types with the EUNIS revision. Various additional data sources can be \nused to describe the biological communities of each habitat e.g. the EVA database for \nvegetation, WISER database for species level information (phytoplankton, macrophytes, benthic \ninvertebrates, fish), and the various Intercalibration Technical Reports under the Water \nFramework Directive with biological information based on a specific water body type e.g. a \nhighland, deep, calcareous lakes in the Alpine region. The following are intercalibration reports \ndescribing other water body types:   Solimini et al. 2014, Gassner et al. 2014, Pall et al. 2014, \nWolfram et al. 2014, Portielje et al. 2014 B\u00f6hmer et al. 2014, Sandin et al. 2014, Hellsten et al. \n2014, Olin et al. 2014, Lyche Solheim et al. 2014, Kelly et al. 2014, Birk et al. 2018, Borics et al. \n2018. \n\n \n\nUsing the discriminating factors from the broad types allows links to be made with Habitat \nDirective Annex I habitat types (i.e. through the relationship between alkalinity and trophic state \nreferred to in the Annex I descriptions). To further describe lower level inland water habitats, \nthe European Red List descriptions can be used as a basis. There is already a strong relationship \nbetween the Red List and EUNIS, and the Red List types will be linked to the broad types via \nEUNIS. These linkages in typologies further connect EU nature and water policies. \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that while the proposed EUNIS structure at level 3 is based on the broad \ntype system, the broad types do not cover all water body types. As all types need to be \nacknowledged in the EUNIS system, the proposed level 3 is a combination of the broad types, \nprevious EUNIS types not included in the broad types and additional types as a result of \ndiscussions from the workshop. \n\n \n\nThe aim of the classification is to be a wall-to-wall classification where all inland water habitat \ntypes can be placed. The habitats can be separated and identified by biological groups \n(characteristic species or species groups) as well as by additional abiotic features at level 4 and \nlower levels. \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 8 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe review of the inland waters group began in 2016 with a scoping study to compare the \ncurrent system with other European typologies: European Red List of habitats, Annex I habitats \nunder the EU Habitats Directive and the Broad Types derived from the Water Framework \nDirective (ETC/BD 2016). Based on this, a first workshop was held in 2018 to look more closely \nat how the current EUNIS system could be represented based on the typology factors used for \nthe Broad Types (ETC/BD 2018). A proposed structure was put to public consultation in 2019, \nthe outcome of which was an evident desire to further look at the structure and the factors used \nto discriminate at level 3 (ETC/BD 2019). Due to Covid 19 and travel restrictions, an expert \nworkshop was delayed in the hope of holding an in-person meeting in 2021. An EIONET webinar \nwas held in December 2020 to further explain the proposed structure and to establish if and \nhow EUNIS is used in the Eionet countries (ETC/BD 2021). Eventually, a virtual workshop was \nheld on March 16th 2021 (Fig. 3). The agenda of the workshop can be seen in Annex 1. The \nrevision of EUNIS inland water habitat group will be developed from EEA, ETC/BD and ETC/ICM \nbased on the outcomes of the studies and meetings mentioned above.   \n\n \n\nBox 1: Approaches used to revise EUNIS habitat classification \n\nThe EUNIS classification is revised down to level 3 through three different approaches: \n\n1) Floristic approach (main approach for terrestrial habitat types but also used in some \nmarine and inland water types), \n\n2) Abiotic approach \u2013 substrate/depth zone/marine region (the main approach for \nmarine benthic types), \n\n3) Abiotic approach \u2013 altitude/catchment size/geology/depth/flow (main approach for \ninland water types). \n\nMost of the habitats can be separated and identified by biological features (characteristic \nspecies or species groups for habitats following approach 1) at level 3 or 4. \n\nIn an entire ecosystem, like a river system, a coastal area or a wetland, the relevant habitat \ntypes may have been revised through one, two or all approaches. It is necessary to look at many \nelements in order to have the full systemic perspective. For example: \n\n\u2022 For a river ecosystem, it would be necessary to select river type and flood plains from the \ninland water habitat group, gravel bars from the sparsely vegetated habitat group and, \ndepending on the extent to which the ecosystem is being looked at, estuaries from the \nhabitat complexes group. A floodplain might also include the grasslands in the floodplain \nfrom the grassland habitat group and the alder forests from the forest habitat group. \n\n\u2022 For a delta ecosystem, it may be necessary to select bog habitat (e.g. calcareous fens) types \nfrom the wetland habitat group, forest types (e.g. Salix alba and Populus alba galleries) from \nthe forest habitat group, grasslands from the grassland habitat group and lakes/ponds and \nrivers/streams from the inland water habitat group. \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 9 \n\n \nFigure 3. Timeline of revision of EUNIS inland water habitat group \n\nThe principles of the proposed EUNIS surface waters revision prior to holding the expert \nworkshop were:  \n\n1. To broadly align the EUNIS inland waters at level 3 with the Broad Types developed from \nLyche Solheim et al. 2019, which are derived from the intercalibration types of the \nWater Framework Directive; \n\n2. To cover other inland water habitats by adding further types where the Broad types do \nnot cover water body types identified in the countries; \n\n3. To include underground inland water bodies that are not considered in the current \nEUNIS inland water habitats; \n\n4. To add smaller water bodies that are not covered by the broad types; \n\n5. To use geology (alkalinity) as a proxy for trophic state as a parameter to describe the \nwater bodies\u2019 natural (pristine or unimpacted) state; \n\n6. The revision should capture differences in all biological communities, not just \nvegetation, where there is a clear difference in at least one part of the taxonomic \nassemblages (e.g. fish, benthic algae, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, phytoplankton, \nzooplankton), this may constitute a different habitat. \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 10 \n\n2 Workshop overview \n\nCareful consideration was put into the identification of experts for coverage of the areas needed \nto answer questions or fill in gaps in the revision. These areas concern expertise in particular \nhabitats and biological communities and to the Habitats Directive and/or the Water Framework \nDirective or both in addition to expertise with inland waters across geographical regions of \nEurope. Eventually, 18 external experts, apart from the organising team were available to \nparticipate in the workshop from 12 countries and 16 different universities and national \nenvironmental agencies (Annex 2) across Europe. \n\n \n\nThe aims of the workshop were to: \n\n\u2022 Clarify rationale behind the proposed structure consulted on in 2019, \n\n\u2022 Address concerns arising out of the consultation and the EIONET webinar, \n\n\u2022 Engage experts with a diverse background covering as many areas of freshwater ecology \nas possible, \n\n\u2022 Get further guidance and direction on proceeding with the level 3 structure, \n\n\u2022 Present and discuss proposed level 4 discriminating factors, \n\n\u2022 Establish the appropriate placement of other abiotic factors to both standing and \nrunning water habitats, \n\n\u2022 Investigate further biological data sources to be exploited. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nEleni Tryfon (EEA) presented an \u2018Overview of the EUNIS habitat classification and European \nclassifications and typologies\u2019, describing the structure of the EUNIS classification system (i.e. \nlevels 1 to 3), the features of the classification system, progress with the revision, the structure \nof the current EUNIS inland water habitat group, challenges and issues with the current structure \nand other inland water habitat typologies. \n\n \n\nAnne Lyche Solheim (ETC/ICM \u2013 NIVA) presented \u2018Broad European Types of Lakes and Rivers: \nRationale, identification and application\u2019. This presentation looked at common issues between \nthe EU Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive, ways to align the Habitats \nDirective and EUNIS inland water types with the Broad Types derived from the WFD, a \ndescription of how the Broad Types were derived, including the descriptors used, and a \njustification for the broad types as an ecologically relevant basis for the EUNIS revision. \n\n \n\nMichelle Watson (ETC/BD \u2013 MNHN) presented the \u2019Revision of EUNIS inland water classification\u2019 \nwhich detailed the background to the EUNIS inland water habitat revision, the development of the \nproposal including the changes between the current and the proposed structure and the final \nproposed list of standing and running water types, issues with the current littoral habitat group, \nthe proposed descriptions of biological communities at level 4, the outcome of the EIONET \nwebinar and data sources to be exploited to describe biological communities at lower levels. \n\n \n\nSession 1 \u2013 standing waters \n\nAnne Lyche Solheim (ETC/ICM \u2013 NIVA) led the discussion on the standing waters session. The \ndiscussion was loosely based around the following questions: \n\n \n\n1. Do you agree with the main abiotic typology factors proposed for level 3?  \n        -If not, should one or more of these factors be supplemented or replaced by others? \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 11 \n\n              -If yes, which factors and why? \n\n2.   Do you agree with the additional abiotic factors proposed for level 4 (size and depth)?  \n           - If not, should one or more of these factors be supplemented or replaced by others?  \n\n              - If yes, which factors and why? \n\n3. Are some important habitat types still missing from the proposal in order to encompass \nyour specific types at the lower levels? \n\n4. Do you support the distinction of the Mediterranean region as a separate geographical \nregion or is that not needed if brackish/saline and temperate lakes/ponds are added at \nlevel 3? Do you agree that the other regions are merged at level 3, and can be further \nspecified at more detailed EUNIS levels? \n\n5. Would you agree that the helophyte vegetation could be moved to a revised Wetlands \nsection? \n\n6.  Would you agree with the proposed approach for descriptions of the biological \ncommunities at level 4 (using European datasets, e.g. WISER or EVA database, WFD \nintercalibration Technical Reports). Are there other databases of use here? \n\n \n\nSession 2 \u2013 running waters \n\nGertie Arts (ETC/BS \u2013 WENR) led the discussion on the running waters session. The discussion \nwas loosely based around the following questions: \n\n \n\n1. Do you agree with the main abiotic typology factors proposed for running waters at \nlevel 3 (altitude, geology, catchment size)? \n\n2. Should flow be included at level 3 or 4? And if at level 3, should it be an additional \nfactor or a replacement? \n\n3. Do you support the distinction of the Mediterranean region as a separate \nbiogeographic region? \n\n4. Should floodplains and braided rivers be added to Habitat complexes or to Sparsely \nvegetated land sections, or be included in the running waters? \n\n5. How to accommodate the dynamics of river systems? \n\n6. Where to include the riparian zone that is temporarily flooded? \n\n7. Description of biological communities. \n\n \n\nThe main themes of the sessions are described in Section 3. As the discussions overlapped \nseveral of the themes identified in the proposed questions, these have been summarised by \ntheme rather than chronologically. For the list of standing water and running water types \nproposed for discussion in the workshop please refer to Annex 3. \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 12 \n\n3 Session 1: Standing waters \n\n3.1 Discussion \n\nBelow is a summary of the main discussions on standing waters during the workshop. In general, \nit was accepted that the proposed level 3 abiotic factors work well for standing waters. It was \nnoted that the concept of \u2018reference condition\u2019 from the Water Framework Directive typology \nwas important as EUNIS needs to describe habitat types in their natural condition. It was also \nargued that the use of the trophic status should not be used as a classification factor as it may \ncommonly result from anthropogenic eutrophication pressures rather than from natural causes.  \nIt was noted that for a habitat to be distinguished from another at least part of the characteristic \nspecies must be different, otherwise it will result in overlapping habitats. It was discussed that \nthere was a need for pragmatism when choosing the discriminating factors at level 3. For other \ntopics discussed no clear agreements were made. \n\n \n\nWhile the discussions below for standing waters are separated into different headings and subheadings, some of these themes and topics overlapped each other during the workshop. \nAdditionally, where themes were common between standing and running waters (e.g. alkalinity, \ngeology) these are discussed in detail only once in the report. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Main abiotic factors at Level 3 \n\n \nSize: \nIt was decided that ponds & pools should be added as a separate type at level 3. This is to give \nthis particular water body type more visibility in the hierarchy. It was proposed to distinguish \nponds & pools with an area of <5 ha. Area is still retained as a separate abiotic factor for all other \nstanding water body types at level 4. This is further discussed in 3.2.2 Additional abiotic factors \nat Level 4. \n \nGeology/Alkalinity: \n\nThe use of alkalinity at level 3 (i.e. geology) was discussed in terms of the link with natural \nnutrient concentration (natural trophic state). A significant positive correlation is shown \nbetween phosphorus concentration and alkalinity in low and moderate to high alkalinity lakes, \nbased on the data compiled in the REBECCA FP6 project1. The relationship described was shown \nfor reference lakes after removing all impacted lakes from the analysis (Lyche Solheim et al. \n2006, 2008). Another large empirical dataset confirming the positive relationship between \nalkalinity and TP emerged from the WISER FP7 project showing a clear correlation between \nalkalinity and phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll, and inverse correlation with altitude based \non multidimensional scaling of data from 1795 lakes and 20 countries, including also \n\n                                                           \n1 The REBECCA project aimed to establish links between the ecological status of surface waters \nand physico-chemical quality elements and pressures from different sources. \n\nDo you agree with the main abiotic typology factors proposed for level 3?  \n-  If not, should one or more of these factors be supplemented or replaced by others? \n\n-  If yes, which factors and why? \n\n \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 13 \n\nMediterranean countries and Eastern European countries (Phillips et al. 2013). Further evidence \nof this positive relationship is given by paleo-ecological data in UK lakes (Bennion and Simpson \n2011). These lines of evidence are the basis for the identification of alkalinity ranges in different \nbroad types, which also reflect equivalent ranges used in the WFD common intercalibration \ntypes for describing biological reference conditions and class boundaries for WFD high and good \necological status.  \n\n \nThere were several discussions, both in the workshop and through correspondence with experts \nafterwards, about the nature of this relationship and its strength across all European lake types. \nOne of the workshop participants commented that there is no fundamental reason for a high \nalkalinity lake to have a high phosphorus concentration and this was demonstrated in a study \nfrom the 1980s in the Canadian shield lakes (D\u2019Arcy & Carignan, 1997) where high phosphorus \nconcentration was due to catchment size and the residence time of phosphorus in soils rather \nthan a high alkalinity concentration. The positive relationship between alkalinity and \nphosphorus was seen as being mostly statistical without a clear reason as to why such a \nrelationship should exist. After the workshop, the chair of the standing waters session suggested \nthat one possible reason may be that the dominating mineral for phosphorus in natural \ncatchments is apatite, which are calcium-phosphate compounds [Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086(OH)\u2082, Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086F\u2082 \nand Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086Cl\u2082]. Another reason can be the relatively high content of alkalinity and \nphosphorus found in marine deposits, which are dominating the catchments in lowland areas of \nNordic lakes, due to the land uplift after the last glaciation.   \n \nIn an ad-hoc meeting with experts after the workshop, there was further discussion about the \napplicability of this relationship to Mediterranean lakes in particular. The positive relationship \nbetween alkalinity and total phosphorus (natural trophic status) as demonstrated via the \nREBECCA and WISER projects included Mediterranean reservoirs, but did not include natural \nlakes from the Mediterranean region. Mediterranean lakes with moderate or high alkalinity can \nsometimes have quite low phosphorus concentration (= naturally oligotrophic state) due to coprecipitation of phosphorus with CaCO3 (but they are not considered to be marl lakes).  These \nMediterranean lakes either need to be identified as a separate type at level 3 or to be captured \nat level 4, as a subtype of calcareous lakes to ensure that the Mediterranean natural lakes with \nhigh alkalinity and low phosphorus can also fit within the system. \n\n \nThe positive relationship between alkalinity and phosphorus, as described above, does not apply \nto karstic or marl lakes. Such lakes have very high alkalinity combined with low phosphorus \nconcentrations due to phosphorus being co-precipitated with calcium-carbonate (e.g. DanenLouwerse et al. 1995). Karstic lakes are to be included as a separate type at level 3. \n \nAltitude: \nThe upper altitude limit is denoted by the treeline in the proposed structure however it was \nsuggested to use the timberline instead. The timberline is a limit beyond which the change in \nclimate is evident.  This would also capture the changes seen when moving from South to North \nin latitude.  \n \nThe altitude threshold of 200m between low and mid altitude lakes was also supported from a \nCentral European point of view.  \n \nLatitude is important to consider in order to account for the change from a cold/wet oceanic \nclimate in North-Western Europe to a warm and dry Continental or Mediterranean climate in \nSouth-Eastern Europe. \n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 14 \n\nIt was discussed whether temperature could be a better discriminating factor than \naltitude/latitude. However, temperature is a complicated variable to incorporate in terms of \nwhat to measure (air or water), how it needs to be measured (min, max, over what time period) \nand how to obtain this information. This applies to running waters as well. Altitude/latitude is \nseen as a proxy for temperature.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Additional abiotic factors at Level 4 \n\n \n\n \nSize: \nThe placement of \u2018ponds\u2019 in the proposed structure was discussed in detail. By strict definition, \nponds are a very different habitat to lakes. Lakes are dominated by fish communities, \nphytoplankton, zooplankton. Ponds can sometimes be without fish and therefore invertebrates \nor amphibians can be top predators, along with phyto- and zooplankton. This difference should \nbe captured in the typology, an option is to include ponds as a separate category to lakes at level \n3. \n \nIt was agreed that <10 ha area is too big as an upper size limit division under which to describe \nponds. Some water bodies can be only 100m2 in size. It\u2019s important that these size classes are \ncaptured even though some of water bodies may not be classified as ponds but actually \nrelatively deep lakes, which has strong implications for their biological communities (e.g. the \nAnnex I habitat 3190 lakes of gypsum karst can occur with small surface areas but be either \nshallow or deep). A size limit of <5ha was discussed, within which further divisions of 1ha, 0.1ha \nand smaller can be distinguished. It was suggested to further divide ponds at level 4 based on \ndystrophic, non-dystrophic, lime pools etc. Dystrophic (humic) lakes are captured already at \nlevel 3 as well as alkalinity (lime lakes).  Differences in depth will be captured at level 4. \n \nIt was noted that there is a difference between pools and ponds, and the title of this group at \nlevel 3 should capture both pools and ponds. In terms of area it was questioned whether there \nis a size cut-off for when a pool should be considered as part of the wetland habitat section. \nThere are small pools of 2x2m present in bog habitats but based on the vegetation present (i.e. \nnon-aquatic) they belong in the wetland habitat section.   \n \nRegarding the placement of ponds/pools, it was suggested to include these as a separate group \nat level 3. It was questioned whether biological communities in ponds and pools react differently \nto altitude and alkalinity than biological communities in lakes, and if this justifies keeping them \nas a separate group at level 3. However, as ponds are smaller and have smaller catchments, they \nare easier to preserve and are important at landscape level. Including them at level 3 would \nensure they stand out as a separate group and remain visible in the structure.  \n \nLinks were provided to further sources of information on ponds, the Ponderful project and \u2018The \nPond Manifesto\u2019 from the European Pond Conservation Network. \n\n \n\n \n\nDo you agree with the additional abiotic factors proposed for level 4 (size and depth)?  \n- If not, should one or more of these factors be supplemented or replaced by others?  \n\n- If yes, which factors and why? \n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://ponderful.eu/\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 15 \n\n3.1.3 Missing types to incorporate \n\n \n\n \n\nMarl lakes are a separate type to be included. This will be captured at level 3 under \u2018karstic \nlakes\u2019.  \n\n \n\nVolcanic lakes will also be their own separate group at level 3. There is much difference between \nMacaronesian, Icelandic and Mediterranean volcanic lakes, this will be distinguished at level 4. \n\n \n\n3.1.4 Distinction of Mediterranean region \n\n \n\n \n\nAs both saline and temporary water bodies are included at level 3, there is no need to distinguish \nthe Mediterranean region at this level. Regional distinction can be at lower levels if it\u2019s useful. \n\n \n\n3.1.5 Placement of littoral habitats \n\n \n\nAlthough isoetids can be considered amphibious vegetation in very small water bodies (ponds \nand pools) in the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, they are submerged and truly aquatic in \nmost of the other lake habitats in all regions, and are therefore considered as aquatic vegetation \nto stay in the inland waters group. The amphibious nature of isoetids in ponds and pools can be \ndescribed at level 3 or level 4. \n\n \n\n \nAn argument to keep the helophytes in the inland water section is that they are already an \nessential part of WFD assessment of ecological status for macrophytes in lakes e.g. in Spain \n(Camacho et al. 2019), and also in Finland and Poland. They are very sensitive to pressures i.e. \nwater level regulation, other hydromorphological pressures, eutrophication pressures etc. and \nare therefore good indicator species in terms of assessment of ecological status under the WFD. \nIt was noted that whichever habitat group the helophytes are placed, they can be linked to the \nappropriate inland water habitats in terms of their descriptions i.e. at level 4. These descriptions \ncan also refer to the functional importance of a habitat to an ecosystem and to other EUNIS \nhabitat groups. It was discussed that helophytes are not always related to water bodies.

Summary of the main topics discussed during the workshop for the standing water bodies \n\nMain abiotic factors at Level 3 \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nPonds/pools to be \nincluded as a \nseparate group at L3 \n \nUpper size limit <1ha \nor <5ha  \n\nPonds are a very different habitat to lakes (e.g. they can be \nrepresented more by invertebrates as the top predators in the \nabsence of fish, used more by amphibians). \n \nPonds also have smaller catchments and are easier to conserve \nand incorporating them at L3 is a good way to protect biodiversity \nat landscape level. This also ensures they are kept visible in the \nproposed structure. \n \nIt is proposed to further divide these based on size and depth at \nL4.  \n \nThe appropriate cut-off size for ponds/pools was discussed i.e. \nwhether 5ha or 1ha could be an appropriate cut-off size. Many \nfish ponds can be over 100ha. It is important to avoid including \nthose which are artificial fish ponds. Area is currently a defining \nfactor at L4 so this water body type will be further divided. \n \nSmall dystrophic pools in bogs are considered as inland waters \nbased on their biological communities. These are totally \nseparated from other water bodies, can be as small as 2x2m area. \n \n\nPonds will be kept as a separate group at L3. \nAlso, to include \u2018pools\u2019 in the title as this will capture the \nsmallest inland standing water bodies. \n \nThe exact surface area increments are to be decided however \n1ha or 5ha was discussed. \n \nIt will be investigated to define further size limits at L4 (e.g. 1ha, \n0.1ha, 0.01 \u2013 0.1ha etc), however it depends on biological \ncommunities being distinguished further based on size classes. \n \n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 18 \n\nWater bodies with small surface areas may also have a wide \nrange of depth e.g. Annex I habitats 3190 Lakes of gypsum karst. \nDepth is already considered as a discriminating factor at L4. \n\nDelineation of the \nboundary for highaltitude water bodies \n \n \n\nAs the climate clearly gets harsher above the timberline it was \nsuggested to use this as the delineation of high-altitude \nwaterbodies rather than the treeline. \n \nThe difference being that treeline means the upper limit of single \nindividual trees, while the timberline is the upper limit of forests. \n\nTimberline is more appropriate and this will be used instead of \ntreeline. \n\nThreshold between \nlow and mid-altitude \nwaterbodies - 200m \n\nThere was general agreement that this an acceptable limit (also \nfrom a Central European perspective). \n\n200m is appropriate for delineation between low-mid-altitude \nwater bodies. \n\nTemperature as an \nindependent \ndiscriminating factor \n\nTemperature by itself will not be included as a separate factor as \nit is often difficult to obtain this information (i.e. should be water \ntemperature and not air temperature) and it varies a lot in space \n(at a scale of a few km2 depending on local topography and \nsize/depth of the lake) and time (at a scale of hours) and it is too \ndifficult to get access to the data. \n \nAltitude/latitude is a good proxy for temperature so it is not \nneeded as a discriminating factor. \n\nTemperature by itself will not be included as a separate factor.   \n\nAlkalinity (i.e. \ngeology) as a \ndiscriminating factor \n \n\nIt was discussed whether the relationship between alkalinity and \nnutrient concentration was statistical rather than there being a \nfundamental reason for this relationship. \nThis relationship (i.e. between low/high alkalinity and low/high \nphosphorus) was shown in reference lakes (REBECCA and WISER \nprojects, as well as from paleolimnology), but does not apply to \nmarl-lakes, karstic lakes where the alkalinity is extremely high \n(because the phosphorus is naturally low due to co-precipitation \nwith CaCO3).  \n\nGeology (i.e. alkalinity) is retained as a discriminating factor at \nL3 as a relationship between total phosphorus (natural trophic \nstate) and alkalinity has been shown in reference lakes (LycheSolheim et al. 2006, 2008, Phillips et al. 2008, Bennion and \nSimpson 2011). This allows a link between the revised EUNIS \nhabitats and the HD Annex I habitat types.  \n \nThe positive relationship between alkalinity and total \nphosphorus may not apply to all Mediterranean waterbodies. \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 19 \n\n \nIt has been shown, in Scandinavia, where the majority of \nEuropean lakes are found, the reason for this relationship is that \nthe bedrock is often siliceous and the natural P-concentration is \nvery low (< 5 \u00b5g/l), while in areas in the lowlands where there are \nmarine deposits (after the last glaciation), the soils have higher Pconcentration and provide naturally more fertile areas, and lakes \nwith higher natural P-concentration (the marine deposit-line is \nca. 200 m altitude in Eastern Norway and Southern Sweden and \nSouthern Finland). Marl-lakes and karstic lakes are proposed as \nseparate types at L3. \n \nSeparately, it was discussed that this relationship may not apply \nto some Mediterranean water bodies e.g. calcareous lakes with \nlow phosphorus concentrations. A system whereby alkalinity \nranges are referred to in level 4 rather than at level 3 may be a \nway to ensure this current system is retailed while allowing these \nspecific lake types to be included in the system. \n\nTherefore, the system should enable these types to also be \nreflected either as a separate type at L3 or a sub-type of \ncalcareous lakes at level 4. \n \n\nAdditional abiotic factors at Level 4 \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nArea as a \ndiscriminating factor  \n\nWater body size (surface area) is important for biodiversity and is \nappropriate to be included at L4. \nPonds/pools are captured as a separate group at L3.  \n \nVery large lakes (> 100 km2) are also identified as a separate type \nat L3 due to their huge water volume and very long retention \ntime. \n  \n\nFurther discussion is needed concerning finer divisions of size \nat L4 for ponds/pools (see the first row on \u2018Main abiotic factors \nat Level 3\u2019 above).  \nThis subdivision depends on whether differences in biological \ncommunities can be identified at further size classes. \n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 20 \n\nDepth as a \ndiscriminating factor  \n\nIt was agreed that depth was an important factor for \ndiscriminating between standing water body types due to \nstratification and mixing patterns influencing the functioning of \nthe lake and its biological communities. Its placement at L4 is \nappropriate. \nDepth was previously included at L3 in an earlier version of the \nstructure. However, based on the multiple depth classes to be \nconsidered this resulted in a large number of types at L3, \ntherefore depth was moved to L4. \nWater retention time is also described alongside depth at L4. \n\nDepth and water retention time to be included at L4. Depth \nincrements were suggested but not decided upon. Ponds will \nalso be further divided by depth at L4. \n\nDistinction of Mediterranean region \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nInclusion of the \nMediterranean \nregion at L3. \n\nSaline and temporary lakes are represented at L3, which is \nsufficient to distinguish the Mediterranean region water bodies. \nRegions can be included at lower levels if needed. \nThe Metzger (2012) \u2018Environmental Zones\u2019 (i.e. climatic zones) is \nanother factor which could be included at lower levels instead of \nregion (if needed). \n\nRegion is not to be included at L3, but may be considered at L4. \n \n\nMissing types to incorporate \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nMarl/karstic lakes to \nbe included as a \nseparate group at L3 \n\nTo be included as a separate group at L3 (see the L3 row on \nalkalinity above).  \n\nTo be included as a separate group at L3. \n \n\nVolcanic lakes to be \nincluded as a \nseparate group at L3 \n\nThese lakes have a different water chemistry to other standing \nwater bodies in the proposed structure. \nThere are also regional differences i.e. between Icelandic, \nMacaronesian and Italian volcanic lakes. These will be \ndistinguished further at L4. \n\nTo be included as a separate group at L3. \n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 21 \n\nPlacement of ditches \n \n\nIt was not decided if ditched should be kept in standing or running \nwaters. It was suggested to include these in the title of \u2018ponds\u2019 at \nL3 if kept in the standing water group. \nThere was opposition to including then in the EUNIS system at all \nas it was noted that the system needs to describe natural habitats \nwhich would not include ditches. \n\nNo decision is made on the placement of ditches. \n\nPlacement of littoral habitats \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nIsoetids species to \ndescribe aquatic \ncommunities \n\nIt is noted that in the Mediterranean, Isoetes histrix is found on \nwet outcrops in spring and live in dry soil for most of the year. \nIsoetids in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions can be \namphibious in very small lakes, ponds and pools. However, in \nother lake types, the isoetids are more submerged.  \n\nIsoetids are indicator species that are sensitive to \neutrophication and should be kept as aquatic vegetation and \ndescribed in the inland standing water habitats. \n\nHelophytes to be \nincluded in wetlands \n\nThis proposal is based on reed beds often occurring separately \nfrom water bodies i.e. wetland depressions in the landscape. If \nthese are included only in the inland waters, it will result in many \nnon-aquatic habitat types. Finland and Poland use these as part \nof WFD ecological status assessment for macrophytes in lakes \nand would prefer to keep them in inland waters. \n \nIt was suggested to move the helophytes to the wetland habitat \ngroup and refer to it in the inland water habitats descriptions. \n\nHelophytes to stay in the wetland habitat group. \n \n \n\nPlacement of \namphibious habitats \n\nThis is still an ongoing discussion in relation to the revision of the \nEUNIS wetland habitats group. \n\nTo be further investigated in conjunction with the discussion on \nhelophyte habitat placement. \n\f\n \n\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 22 \n\n \n\n4 Session 2: Running waters \n\n4.1 Discussion \n\nBelow is summarised the discussions from the workshop on running waters. Clear decisions or \nagreements were not made for all topics discussed. In general, it was discussed that variables \ndriving the form and function of river habitats should be more evident at level 3 e.g. a factor to \nmeasure the energy of the water course and its ability to move sediment around. This should \nalso reflect the dynamics of the systems. It was discussed that describing at level 3 anything \nbeyond what is already used is too detailed e.g. stream power, flow etc. The issue with \ndescribing flow in the EUNIS system is that it changes with location and with time, there many \nways to define and measure flow-related variables (i.e. different variables, e.g. current velocity, \nslope, flow, gradient, level of braiding or meandering). Flow dynamics should be incorporated \ninto the system in a way that can be measured and observed at a pan-European scale. Another \nproblem with flow-related variables is that they are often modified by man due to \nhydromorphological alterations (e.g. hydropower, transport, urbanisation, drainage). \n\n \n\nIt was noted from one participant that EUNIS needs to inform biodiversity policy whereas the \nBroad Types inform water policy. The European Red List of habitats was suggested as a good \nstarting point to describing inland water habitats at a lower level. As there is already a strong \nrelationship between the Red List and EUNIS, incorporating the Red List allows for a link to be \nmade with the broad types, which further allows EU nature and water policies to be linked. The \nBroad Types are based on purely natural abiotic factors that are important to explain natural \nbiological variability. \n\n \n\nWhile the summary of discussions below is separated into different headings, many of these \nthemes and topics overlapped each other during the workshop. Additionally, where themes \nwere common between standing and running waters (e.g. alkalinity, geology) these are \ndiscussed in detail only once in the report (i.e. in Section 3 above). \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Main abiotic factors at Level 3 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Zones: \nIt was discussed which \u2018climate\u2019 element was most appropriate to incorporate at level 3. The \nMetzger et al. 2012 \u2018Environmental Zones of Europe\u2019 was suggested as a discriminating factor \nto include at Level 3 (Fig. 4). The zones are based largely on the parameters described at level 3 \ne.g. geology as well as the climatic components, which have a direct relationship to the flow. \nThey are represented by a composite measurement linked to each zone. This factor was also \nuseful as a descriptor of habitat types in the AMBER project in conjunction with slope, catchment \nsize, geological classification, Strahler order. \n \n \n\nDo you agree with the main abiotic typology factors proposed for running waters at level \n3 (altitude, geology, catchment size)? \n\n \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 23 \n\n \nFigure 4. Metzger et al. (2012) showing the \u2018Environmental Zones of Europe\u2019 \n\nShape/form: \nIt was discussed that an indicator of size (form and shape) is needed at level 3. Catchment area, \nwhich is already accounted for, can capture the size of a river system. The opposite view was \nalso presented i.e. that other factors, such as climatic factors (e.g. Environmental Zones) should \nbe represented at level 3, with factors describing shape and form at lower levels. \nLevel 4 in the proposed structure describes riffles, pools and runs, which describe the form and \nfunction of a river system. However, this system is considered as too fine a scale to be described \nat this level i.e. a riffle and a pool can occur a few meters away from each other. The UK is \ninvestigating GIS modelling to describe form, in very general terms, across reaches of rivers (see \nBox 2 in section 4.1.2 below). \nIt was suggested that the Environmental Zones could be incorporated at level 3 or level 4, as \nbiogeography is already incorporated. It was suggested that geology is better described at level \n4 i.e. to have an abiotic, physical, functional typology at level 3, then water chemistry and other \nvariables at level 4. However, it has been shown that factors such as geology (alkalinity), altitude \nand catchment size, stream order, are relatively good descriptors of biological relationships at a \ncoarse scale (and also reflected in the Environmental Zones). Additionally, the parameters used \nneed to be independent of human influence, an example of this is altitude and geology and \ncatchment size. Factors like flow and stream power are not free of human influence. \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 24 \n\n4.1.2 Inclusion of flow at Level 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nFlow:  \nFlow is an important factor to include when describing a river system as it is a way of capturing \nthe hydraulic energy in the river system that is responsible for shaping it i.e. through moving and \nredistributing sediment and hence largely determining the geomorphological form of the river. \nIt was discussed that to consider hydraulic energy there is a need to consider flow as well as \ncurrent velocity, and that the pattern of flow velocity and its amplitude (high versus low velocity) \nis more important than the mean or average velocity.  Whereas \u2018flow\u2019 is an indication of river \nsize, \u2018velocity\u2019 is \u2018something that organisms experience\u2019.  \n \nHowever, as flow is subject to human interference, this makes it difficult to incorporate in the \nsystem e.g. altering flow for dams, irrigation etc. While it was noted that direct measurements \nof flow are very detailed to incorporate at level 3, it was suggested that modelling flow could be \nan option. A system whereby GIS modelling can be used to generate unimpacted reference \nconditions (a necessity of describing habitats in the EUNIS system) could be considered in the \nfuture. Such a system is being developed in the UK (please see Box 2 in \u2018Stream power\u2019 below). \nHowever, this would require access to Europe-wide datasets, which are not available at the \nmoment. This analysis is also beyond the scope of this revision. \n \nThe proposed structure as it stands includes a more simplistic reference to river flow at level 4 \nin the form of riffles, pools and runs (described in more detail in \u2018Dynamics & scale\u2019 below). \n\u2018Stream power\u2019, related to flow and velocity, is described in more detail below. \n \nStream power:  \n\u2018Stream power\u2019, which is currently used in predictive modelling in the UK (with the aim of \npredicting habitats at different scales), was discussed as a possible discriminating factor at level \n3. The modelling looks at the changes in reference stream power on a longitudinal basis along \nthe entire river network and aims to relate this to changes in habitat character (using the \ngeomorphic types of the Red List of habitats). It can be use to describe the shape of the habitat, \nthe impact of hydraulic energy on redistributing river sediment thereby describing the \nfunctioning of a river system. It can also capture climate and catchment information.  \nIn more detail, the GIS modelling aims to predict the likelihood of a specific reach of river of \nhaving a specific flow and substrate, such as high current velocity with big stable substrate, low \nvelocity with finer substrates etc. This gives a picture of how sediment is generated and how it \nis moved around a river system. \n \nThe modelling process accounts for artificial factors as much as possible i.e. where natural flow \nis manipulated. However, the dataset would need to be modelled across Europe to be useful in \nthis context. See Box 2 below for more information on using stream power in the UK context. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShould flow be included at level 3 or 4? And if at level 3, should it be an additional factor \nor a replacement? \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 25 \n\nBox 2: A UK perspective on abiotic characterisation of the European Red List river/stream \ntypology and its relevance to the EUNIS review \n\nThe Red List typology includes a small set of hydraulic/geomorphic river/stream types from \nEUNIS Level 3 that provides a holistic basis for describing habitat character which relates to \ndistinctive biological assemblages. Variations in habitat generated by water chemistry \n(particularly alkalinity/hardness) can be seen as a secondary source of variation, often \ninvolving the substitution of related species according to water chemistry preferences. \n\nKey river/stream types are as follows: \n\n\u2022  Red ListC2.2a  Permanent non-tidal, fast, turbulent watercourse of montane to \nalpine regions with mosses \n\n\u2022  Red ListC2.2b  Permanent non-tidal, fast, turbulent watercourse of plains and \nmontane regions with Ranunculus spp. \n\n\u2022  Red List C2.3  Permanent non-tidal, smooth-flowing watercourse \n\n\u2022  Red List C2.4  Tidal river, upstream from the estuary. \n\nTo this list can be added dynamic gravel-bed rivers or \u2018active shingle\u2019 rivers, which are \ncurrently only included in the Red List typology as riparian habitats. \n\nSome of these types have strong relationships with Habitats Directive Annex I river types such \nas watercourses with Ranunculion /Batrachian vegetation (H3260) and alpine rivers.  \n\nOn-going modelling work in the UK is looking at how the natural spatial distribution of these \ntypes can be predicted across the UK using environmental variables, with the aim of providing \na simple basis for characterising key variations in habitat provision within rivers/streams. \nModelled distributions can be used to help report on the condition of these different river \ntypes (for example by filtering relevant Water Framework Directive data), stratify monitoring \nregimes and plan conservation strategies. Further modelling work is planned to model the \ndistribution of other Red List river/stream types. \n\nThere are various abiotic variables that can be used in this kind of prediction, all relating to \nhydraulic energy and the ability of river and stream channels erode and deposit sediments of \nvarying coarseness (from boulders all the way down to silts). Any such modelling has to take \naccount of the nested spatial scales of habitat variation inherent in river systems. The aim is \n\nto characterise general habitat \ncharacter at the large-reach scale \n(of the order of a few kilometres), \naccepting that there will be smaller \nscale habitat variation within \nreaches. \n\nThe analysis has focused on stream \npower as a derived attribute that \nreflects the contribution of a \nnumber of environmental variables \nto the hydraulic energy of a \nriver/stream section. There are \nissues with generating estimates of \nstream power that are free of \nanthropogenic influence, but \nanalytical options have been  \n\nFigure 1. Modelling \u2018natural\u2019 longitudinal variation in       chosen to be as free of human \nstream power along the river/stream network (colours    modification as possible. A simple \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 26 \n\nindicate the predicted location of different river/stream   division of reach-scale stream power \n types)                                                                                          values can potentially provide a \n\nreasonable model of the distribution of relevant river/stream types, but to assist with the \nprediction of active-shingle river sections an approach has been adopted that tracks \nlongitudinal changes in stream power down the river network (Figure 1).  \n\nLongitudinal changes in river/stream types have been estimated according to changes in \n\nstream power. Typological boundaries were estimated by reference to the habitat \n\ncharacteristics of a large national dataset of survey sites with low level of anthropogenic \n\nmodification (using the UK River Habitat Survey method). Provisional model outputs are now \n\nbeing ground-truthed (Figure 2) and the model recalibrated to provide a better fit to reality. \n\nModelling is being undertaken at high spatial resolution and then aggregated up to large \n\nreach-scale to provide an output indicating overall habitat character. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Ground-truthing of provisional model predictions \n\n \n\nDynamics & scale: \nLinked to flow and stream power as described above, the incorporation of shape and form at \nlevel 4 was further discussed. The proposed structure already describes riffles, runs and pools, \nwhich, to a degree, captures the flow and form and function river system. However, this system \nwas described as occurring within a very short distance of each other in the river i.e. pools, riffles \nand runs occurring within a few meters of each other in a river, which is a quite detailed scale \nto be described at level 4. While not appropriate for the current EUNIS inland waters revision, \nan example of a broader characterisation at intermediate levels i.e. where river form is \ncharacterised over a distance of a few kilometres rather than meters (as can be the case with \npools, riffles and runs), is seen in (Box 2). A broader system at level 4 would allow the more \ndetailed system of pools, riffles and runs to be described at lower levels (i.e. levels 7 or 8).  \n\n \n\nIt was noted that we are working with phenomena on two different scales: coarse and fine. An \nexample is floodplains, it can be a single habitat but also a complex of different fine scale \nhabitats. The habitats on these two scales can exist within one system e.g. habitats on a coarse \nscale can include habitats on a finer scale as well. Additionally, some habitats, especially in the \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 27 \n\ninland water habitat group, can include finely divided habitats from the other habitat groups. If \nwe accept braided river floodplains or normal river floodplains as a single habitat by themselves \nthen we risk excluding many other fine scale habitats from the system that are already there \ne.g. floodplain forest, floodplain scrub, and which are important to biodiversity. This \u2018nested \nspatial scale\u2019 was discussed with regard to the use of EUNIS in decision making, e.g. restoring \nriver ecosystem through restoring their natural functions. If parts of the ecosystem are \ndisembodied and placed in different habitat groups (e.g. habitat complex group, sparsely \nvegetated habitat group), it undermines the ability of the EUNIS classification to underpin \ndecision making to promote restoration of river ecosystems. An example of this is placing the \nfloodplains and braided rivers in the habitat complex group and not the inland water habitat \ngroup. \n\n \n\n4.1.3 Distinction of Mediterranean region \n\n \n\nAs discussed in the standing waters session, there is no need to distinguish the Mediterranean \nregion at level 3 as tidal, temporary and ephemeral rivers waters are represented as separate \ntypes at level 3. However, in relation to the discussion of Environmental Zones (see 4.1.1), \nincluding this parameter at level 4 will also include an element of regional distinction (See fig. 4, \nEnvironmental Zones map). \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Incorporation of floodplains and braided rivers \n\n \n\n \nFloodplains and Braided rivers: \nNormal floodplains, not including braided rivers, are generally considered as complex of habitats \nand were initially proposed to be included in the EUNIS habitat complexes group. This was due \nto the difference stages of vegetation succession (i.e. advanced, initial development etc). It is \nalso logical in the EUNIS system to include gravel bars in the inland sparsely vegetated habitats \ngroup (i.e. with Epilobium fleischeri and similar species) flooded grasslands in the grassland \nhabitats, Salix forest in the forest habitat group. \n \nThere was disagreement about separating floodplains, braided rivers and gravel bars from the \ninland water habitat group. It was discussed that anything in-channel (braided channels, gravel \nbars) should remain with running waters as they are functional parts of the river ecosystem, and \nin terms of restoration, the entire ecosystem should be considered. In terms of describing a river \nchannel, a braided river is a channel form and should be kept in this group. \n \nIn terms of including floodplains in the habitat complex group, despite being considered a \n\u2018habitat complex\u2019 in themselves, they can still be included in the inland water habitat group. It \nwas noted that there is a need to acknowledge that some habitat types in the inland water \nhabitat group will have the same vegetation as habitat types occurring in other habitat groups \ni.e. contain elements that are described in other parts of the EUNIS system. \n\nDo you support the distinction of the Mediterranean region as a separate biogeographic \nregion? \n\n \n\nShould floodplains, braided rivers and gravel bars be added to Habitat complexes or to \nSparsely vegetated land sections, or be included in the running waters? \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 28 \n\n \nSome of the smaller rivers may not have much of a floodplain e.g. coastal countries where many \ncatchments are very small and/or have rivers that flow off mountains near the coast. Some of \nthe proposed river types at level 3 refer to rivers starting small in the mountains, coming down \nto having large floodplains in the lowlands, which may not be the case with some rivers. There \nare other European river types that don\u2019t follow the same order i.e. some are a bit flashier, can \nhave a big floodplain etc. The current typology should capture all these types. \n \nThe recent floodplain typology devised by ETC/ICM was suggested as a way to keep floodplains \nin the running waters group i.e. to be described at level 4 within each river type where \nappropriate. It is based on altitude, slope, width and run-off. \n \nTable 2. Floodplain typology from ETC/ICM 2020 \n\n \n \n\nThere was general agreement that including floodplains and braided rivers in the running waters \ngroup is appropriate. It was also agreed that it\u2019s difficult to deal with these specific habitats and \ntheir placement in the system and there\u2019s a big difference in how the terrestrial and aquatic \nhabitats are dealt with (i.e. it appears to be easier to use abiotic factors to describe inland \nwaters, unlike terrestrial habitats).  \n \nIt was discussed that the EUNIS habitat complexes group could be kept to describe terrestrial \n(and marine) habitats only. The inland waters group will retain habitats generally considered as \na complex (i.e. floodplains and braided rivers).  \n \n\nhttps://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-icm/products/preliminary-assessment-of-river-floodplain-condition-in-europe\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 29 \n\n4.1.5 Addressing temporarily flooded riparian zone \n\n \n\nSee discussion in 4.1.4 above. \n\n \n\n4.1.6 Description of biological communities \n\n \n\n \nNo additional data sources were identified.\n\nWhere to include the riparian zone that is temporarily flooded? \n\n \n\nAre you happy with the proposed approach for descriptions of the biological \ncommunities at Level 4 (using EU-level datasets, e.g. WISER, EVA database, Biofresh, red \n\nList, Intercalibration datasets).  \n\nAre there other databases of use here? \n\n \n\f\n \n\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 30 \n\n4.2 Main messages \n\nBelow is a summary of the main points in relation to the original topic questions asked. While \nsome conclusions were reached, there are still some topics that need further discussion. These \nare listed in the column \u2018General outputs from workshop\u2019.\n\f\n \n\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 31 \n\n \n\nTable 3. Summary of the main topics discussed during the workshop for the running water bodies \n\nMain abiotic factors at Level 3 \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\n\u2018Environmental Zones\u2019 (Metzger et \nal. 2012) and the possible inclusion \nas an alternative discriminating \nfactor at L3 (not to replace a factor). \n \n\n \n\nClimatic factors have a direct relationship with flow (which is \ntoo difficult to characterise/measure). These are missing at L3. \nEnvironmental Zones are based on the factors used at L3 and \nsome climatic factors (e.g. temperature). \nAdditionally, the AMBER project used this (and other variables) \nand found a good relationship with fish communities. \n \n\nL3 needs to incorporate factors independent of human \ninfluence, Environmental Zones meets this criterion. It was \nproposed that this would not replace the current criterion, \nbut complement them. \n \n\nEnvironmental Zones could be seen as a proxy for regions at L4. \n\nThe Environmental Zones were derived from the same \nor similar factors that are already included at L3. This \nwould cause redundancy in the current factors. \n \n\nThere was a discussion to include \u2018regions\u2019 at L4 if \nneeded. However, this was mainly in relation to the \ndistinct hydrology of the Mediterranean region, which \nis being resolved in another way (please see below). \n \n \n\nAn indicator of form or shape is \nneeded at L3 or L4. \n \n \n\nOne view was to include form/shape at L3 and include \nwater chemistry at L4. Catchment area was described as \nan appropriate factor of form, and is already incorporated. \n \n\nAn opposite view was that L3 should be coarser, with \ngeology, altitude, catchment size (and possibly \nEnvironmental Zones). Shape and form should then be \nincluded at more detailed, lower levels. \n\nThe factors that are incorporated in the current system \n(altitude, catchment size and geology) are clear and \nsimple and represent a coarse system, anything more \nthan this is too fine in detail. \n \n \n\nInclusion of flow at Level 4 \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 32 \n\nInclusion of flow in the system, \nincluding its placement in the \nstructure (i.e. at L3 or L4). \n \n \n\nIt was discussed that a measurement describing the \n\u2018function\u2019 of a river system should be incorporated at L3 \nwith flow being an obvious factor. However, it is difficult to \nmeasure/subject to human influences and therefore too \ndifficult to incorporate at this level. \n \n\n\u2018Stream power\u2019 captures the \u2018energy\u2019 of the system i.e. the \nhydraulic energy. It\u2019s an indication of river size, velocity is \nsomething that organisms experience. This drives the \n\u2018shape\u2019 of the habitat and nature/dynamics of substrates. \n \n\nFlow is currently captured at L4 through pools, riffles and \nruns. \n\nStream power, while an appropriate measurement to \ncapture flow, velocity and hydraulic energy, cannot be \nincluded in this revision of EUNIS. The reason being that \nit is based on modelling that has not yet been applied \non a European scale. This can be considered in the \nfuture. However, stream power is strongly modified by \nman in a large number of rivers and is highly variable \nwith time (sometimes from hour to hour due to flash \nfloods or hydropeaking). \n \n\nFlow in general is an issue in terms of how to \ncharacterising it/measuring it. It changes with location \nand time and is subject to human influence.  \n \n\nThe proposed system includes the system of riffles, \npools, runs at L4, which encapsulates flow to a degree. \n\nCurrent L4 discriminating factors: \nRiffles, pools, runs. \n \n \n\nIt was discussed that these are very fine scale habitats and \nwould be more appropriate to include at levels lower than \n4 (e.g. L7 or 8). Further divisions are needed before \ndescribing pools, riffles, rapids and runs.  \n\nFurther investigation needed for L4 factors. \nIt was suggested to place these at levels lower than 4 \n(e.g. L7 or 8). It was questioned what to include at the \nlevels in between, but there was not a clear view on this \nby the workshop participants.  \n \nRinaldi et al. 2016 suggests a system based on basic river \ntypology (BRT) and extended river typology (ERT), this \nwill be analysed in more detail in relation to describing \nL4.  \n\nDistinction of Mediterranean region \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nInclusion of the Mediterranean \nregion at L3. \n\nOriginally proposed as a factor due to water bodies in the \nMediterranean having a more specific hydrological regime to \nthe rest of Europe. \n\nNot to be included as a separate discriminating factor. \nThe inclusion of temporary, ephemeral and saline \nwater bodies at L3 is sufficient to represent the \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 33 \n\ndistinction of Mediterranean water bodies from the \nrest of Europe. \n\nIncorporation of floodplains and braided rivers \n\nTopic discussed Details General outputs from workshop \n\nPlacement of gravel bars in the \nEUNIS system. \n \n\nIt is logical to include gravel bars in the Sparsely vegetated \nhabitat group based on its vegetation i.e. Epilobium fleischeri. \n \nHowever, there was opposition to this as it was felt that \nanything occurring \u2018in-channel\u2019 should be a part of the river, \nit was described as a retrograde step to take gravel bars out \nof the inland water habitat group.  \n\nGravel bars to be moved to the EUNIS Sparsely \nvegetated habitat group. \n \nVegetation that occurs on a gravel bar is not aquatic \nand therefore cannot represent an aquatic habitat. \nThis habitat can, however, be linked to inland water \nhabitats in the habitat descriptions. \n \n\nPlacement of braided rivers in the \nEUNIS system. \n \n \n\nBraided rivers (and floodplains) are habitat complexes due to \nthe different stages of vegetation succession and were \noriginally considered to be a part of the EUNIS habitat \ncomplexes group. \n \nHowever, as a braided river is itself a channel form, it should \nbe included in the inland waters group, at lower levels which \nwill describe more the form of a river. \n\nBraided rivers to be kept as a part of the inland water \nhabitat group. They will be described at L4 or lower. \nThey are part of the floodplain habitat (see Placement \nof floodplains below). \n\nPlacement of floodplains in the \nEUNIS system. \n \n \n\nThis was originally considered for placement in the habitat \ncomplex group (i.e. along with braided rivers). The rationale \nbehind this is the different stages of succession of vegetation \n(i.e. initial, advanced etc).   \n \nHowever, it was discussed that floodplains, braided rivers \nand the extended riparian zone should be a part of the inland \nwater habitat group as they are a functional part of the whole \nriver ecosystem, even if they are more characteristic of a \nhabitat complex in terms of vegetation present. From a \n\nFloodplains will remain with the inland water habitat \ngroup.  \n \nThe inland water habitat group can include complexes \nif the complex includes aquatic habitats. Examples are \nfloodplains and braided rivers.   \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 34 \n\nconservation and habitat restoration perspective, the whole \necosystem is considered in terms of restoring that ecosystem \nto its natural structure and function and keeping floodplains \nas a part of the inland water habitat group ensures the \nconservation rationale for floodplain and riparian habitats \nremains linked to the conservation rationale for the whole \nriver system. In terms of linking to other habitat groups in \nEUNIS system, this can be done through the habitat \ndescriptions at lower levels. \n\f\n \n\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 35 \n\nOverall conclusions  \n\nThe workshop accommodated a much-needed discussion on inland water habitats in general, \neven outside of the EUNIS classification system. Issues touched were how the classification of \nthese habitats is approached from different areas of expertise and the different needs for a \nclassification typology (e.g. for the purpose of habitat restoration potential, additional \ndesignation of protected area, invasive alien species monitoring and for other policy needs). \n\n \n\nWhile the session on standing waters showed the discriminating factors proposed at level 3 to \nbe more straightforward and also with more agreement between participants, the running \nwaters session revealed more differences in opinion to the approaches at levels 3 and lower. It \nwas agreed that flow was a fundamental discriminating factor that defines the shape and form \nof running water bodies, as well as their biological communities, but due to the high variation of \nflow at small spatial and temporal scale this factor would be more suitable at a more detailed \nlevel e.g. level 4. The discussion on running waters also raised more questions about the scale \nat which these habitats are described. One key difference between describing standing water \nand running water habitats is the dynamics of the system and the role this plays in shaping the \necosystem.  \n\n \n\nThis workshop enabled a frank review of the proposed approach. After discussion with the \nexperts some fundamental changes were proposed for the finalisation of the revision. An \nexample of this is the placement of floodplains and braided rivers in the EUNIS inland water \nhabitats as complexes in themselves, rather than being included in the EUNIS habitat complexes \ngroup. The expert group asked the EEA and ETCs revision team to consider how to allow for \ncomplexes to stay as a part of the inland waters group mainly because of the difficulties in \ndescribing, particularly, the running waters types in a satisfactory way. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, several additional factors not previously considered in relation to the revision of \nEUNIS inland water habitats were discussed e.g. Environmental Zones of Europe, stream power. \nThe Environmental Zones incorporate several factors already considered at level 3 and can be \nconsidered for incorporation at level 4, through the differentiation of regions identified by these \nzones. For stream power, while relevant to the discussion and indeed to a possible future \nrevision of EUNIS inland water habitats, it cannot be considered until more work is undertaken \nto roll this concept out across European datasets.  \n\n \n\nThe aim of the workshop was to move a step further in the classification of inland water habitats. \nIt was not to provide a final list of discriminating factors for the revised structure or a final level \n3 structure. However, based on some agreed topics during the workshop. The remaining \nunresolved discussions in tables 1 and 3 will be taken on by experts at EEA, ETC/BD and ETC/ICM \nand final decisions will be made with a view to developing the revised structure by the end of \n2021.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 36 \n\nList of abbreviations \n\nAbbreviation Name Reference \n\n \n\nAMBER Adaptive Management of Barriers in \nEuropean rivers \n\nhttps://amber.international  \n\nBioFresh Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal https://data.freshwaterbiodiversity.\neu/datapolicy \n\nEEA European Environment Agency www.eea.europa.eu \n\nEIONET European Environment Information \nand Observation Network \n\nwww.eionet.europa.eu/countries \n\nETC/BD European Topic Centre on Biological \nDiversity \n\nhttps://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/\netc-bd \n\nETC/ICM European Topic Centre on Inland, \nCoastal and Marine Waters \n\nhttps://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/\netc-icm \n\nEUNIS European Nature Information \nSystem \n\nhttps://eunis.eea.europa.eu/index.js\np \n\nEVA European Vegetation Archive http://euroveg.org/eva-database \n\nREBECCA Relationships between ecological \nand chemical status of surface \nwaters \n\nwww.cordis.europe.eu/project/id/5\n02158 \n\nWISER Water bodies in Europe \u2013 \nIntegrative Systems to assess \nEcological Status and Recovery \n\nhttp://www.wiser.eu  \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttps://amber.international/\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 37 \n\nGlossary \n\nAmphibious vegetation: Vegetation in the littoral zone of lakes/rivers adapted to both the \naquatic and terrestrial environments. These macrophytes have submerged growth forms and \ncan adapt to a period of the year when this zone is running dry by producing emergent growth \nforms e.g. leaves with stomata.  They form part of the ecosystems of aquatic and terrestrial \nhabitats. The littoral zone changes throughout the year for temporary surface water systems. \n\nAquatic vegetation: macrophyte vegetation that can complete their whole life cycle in water \neither submerged-rooted, submerged or floating e.g. Charids, some Isoetids, Elodeids, \nNymphaeids, Lemnids. \n\nBroad types: \u2018Broad Types\u2019 is a generic typology of European water body types whose basis lies \nin the national types of the Water Framework Directive. Through reflecting the natural variability \nin the most commonly used environmental type descriptors i.e. altitude, geology and size the \nBroad types capture 60 to 70% of all national Water Framework Directive types and almost 80% \nof all European river and lake bodies in almost all European countries. The environmental type \ndescriptors reflect most of the natural variability in reference conditions for the biological \nquality elements. The broad types are linked to the Intercalibration types (see below). \n\nHelophyte: emergent plants typical of marshy or lake-edge environments and shores of slowflowing rivers, in which the perennating organ lies in soil or mud below the water table but the \naerial shoots and flowers protrude above the water (e.g. Phragmites australis, the common \nreed, Carex and Typha species). They can grow on muddy land or in water. \n\nIntercalibration types: common types for a regional group of countries based on high similarity \nof national types defined for the Water Framework Directive. For each common intercalibration \ntype, the class boundaries between high and good, as well as between good and moderate \necological status for national indicators of different biological quality elements were \nintercalibrated between the countries sharing the intercalibration type. The aim was to ensure \nthat the good status class boundaries were consistent with the normative definitions in the WFD \nAnnex V for each of the biological quality elements and that they were harmonized between the \ncountries (i.e. showing the same deviation from reference conditions). \n\nLittoral zone: the zone along the lake shore which is subject to water level fluctuations and wave \naction, and where the sediments have sufficient light available for plants. The littoral zone \ncontains typical habitats for both submerged and truly aquatic vegetation (Charids, Isoetids, \nElodeids, Nymphaeids, Lemnids) and amphibious vegetation adapted to aquatic and terrestrial \nenvironments. \n\nRiparian zone: the zone along the river bank which can be subject to flooding and contains \nvegetation adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial environments (e.g. Salix and Alnus species, \nPhragmites and Typha). \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nRevision of the EUNIS inland water habitat group 38 \n\nReferences \n\nBennion, H. & Simpson, G.

Clean air, \nwater and food are essential for sustaining life; natural \nenvironments provide space for recreation, relaxation \nand social interaction; and raw materials feed into \nour production systems to provide the comforts of \ncontemporary life.\n\nAt the same time, environmental pollution is \nunavoidable. We are exposed to pollution in our \nhomes, in our workplaces, in the outdoor environment \nand when we eat, play, sleep, drive, walk, swim or run. \nIn 2012, 13\u00a0% of all deaths in the EU were attributable \nto the environment (WHO, 2016a). These deaths are \npreventable and can be significantly reduced through \nefforts to improve environmental quality.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic provides a stark example \nof the inextricable links between human health and \necosystem health. This novel disease is thought to \nhave emerged in bat populations and subsequently \njumped species to infect humans in a seafood and \nanimal market. The emergence of such zoonotic \npathogens is linked to environmental degradation and \nhuman interactions with animals in the food system. \nOther factors, such as exposure to air pollution \nand social status, seem to affect transmission \nand mortality rates in ways that are not yet fully \nunderstood.\n\nThe current situation\n\nThe state of the environment in Europe is negatively \naffecting the health and quality of life of European \ncitizens. The World Health Organization (WHO) \nproduces data periodically on the global burden \nof disease attributable to the environment, with \nthe most recent available data \u2014 published in\u00a02016 \n\u2014 indicating that there were 630\u00a0000 deaths \nattributable to the environment in the EU in 2012. \nThe burden of environmental disease is unevenly \nspread across Europe, with the percentage of deaths \n\nattributable to environmental factors ranging from a \nlow of 9 % in Norway and Iceland to 23\u00a0% in Albania \nand 27\u00a0% in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Environmental \npollution is linked to a range of disease outcomes, \nincluding cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory \ndisease and neurological disorders. Living with these \ndiseases reduces quality of life, with more than \n20 million healthy life-years lost because of disease \nattributable to\u00a0poor-quality environments in the \n28 Member States\u00a0of the EU (EU-28) in 2012.\n\nPeople are exposed to multiple environmental \nstressors at any one time, which combine and in some \ncases act synergistically, causing impacts on health. \nIn particular, air pollution and high temperatures \nare known to act synergistically, leading to increased \nmorbidity and mortality. The urban environment is \ncharacterised by the presence of multiple stressors, \nwith people in cities being more exposed to air \npollution, noise and chemicals while also having \nless access to green space than people in rural \nenvironments.\n\n\u2022 Air pollution is the principal environmental factor \ndriving disease, with around 400\u00a0000 premature \ndeaths attributed to ambient air pollution annually in \nthe EU. Poor indoor air quality related to the burning \nof solid fuels results in nearly 26\u00a0000 premature \ndeaths annually across the EEA-39 (1). There is early \nevidence to suggest that long term exposure to air \npollution may increase susceptibility to COVID-19, \nwith further research needed.\n\n\u2022 Noise is the second most significant environmental \nrisk, with exposure to environmental noise causing \n12\u00a0000 premature deaths annually and contributing \nto 48\u00a0000 new cases of ischaemic heart disease.\n\n\u2022 The health impacts of climate change are complex \nand include the immediate dangers of extreme \nweather events, such as heatwaves, extreme \ncold and floods, as well as changing patterns of \nvector-borne and water- and food-borne diseases. \n\nExecutive summary\n\n(1) The EEA-39 includes the 33 member countries of the EEA plus six collaborating countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, \nNorth\u00a0Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo (under UN Security Council Resolution\u00a01244/99)).\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n7Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nHeatwaves are the deadliest type of extreme \nweather across Europe as a whole, with urban areas \nparticularly affected because of the heat island \neffect. Under current global warming scenarios, \nadditional deaths due to heatwaves could reach \nover 130\u00a0000 per year. Heavy precipitation, floods, \nrising sea levels and heatwaves as well as long-term \nclimatic shifts present threats to infrastructure, food \nproduction and other economic activities. Other \nknock-on effects of climate change, for example \nbiodiversity loss, will have indirect impacts, such \nas reduced agricultural productivity and a lower \npotential for identifying plant-based medicines.\n\n\u2022 A wide range of chronic diseases is associated \nwith exposure to hazardous chemicals, with the \nWHO estimating that 2.7\u00a0% of global deaths are \nattributable to chemical exposure. However, the \ntotal burden of chemicals on health in Europe is \nunknown, since understanding of the exposure of \nthe European population to chemicals is limited. \nThere are also knowledge gaps regarding the effects \nof exposure to mixtures of chemicals that act \nsynergistically and the effects of long-term exposure \nto endocrine disruptors.\n\n\u2022 Exposure to electromagnetic fields in Europe is both \npoorly understood and anticipated to increase. \nWhile there are well-defined acute health effects of \nexposure to certain electromagnetic fields, including \nsymptoms such as nerve and sensory organ \nstimulation and the heating of tissues, there is little \nevidence regarding the health impacts of long-term \nexposure for the general population.\n\n\u2022 Water pollution can have an impact on health \nvia contaminated drinking water extracted from \ngroundwater or surface water or contact with \ncontaminated bathing waters, as well as through \nindirect exposure through the consumption of \nfish containing bioaccumulative pollutants, such \nas mercury. The quality of bathing water across \nEurope is consistently high, driven by the successful \nimplementation of EU policies. European bathing \nwater provides an excellent opportunity for people \nto relax and exercise in clean natural environments.\n\n\u2022 Drinking water quality is also consistently high \nacross the EU, according to the parameters \ncurrently monitored. The possible presence \nof emerging pollutants that are not currently \nmonitored in drinking water is a concern. There is \nalso a concern regarding the quality of water from \nsmall supplies and private wells, although this \nrepresents a small proportion of the total supply.\n\n\u2022 Releases of antibiotics via urban waste water \ntreatment plants can significantly accelerate the \nemergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. \nInfections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria \nare estimated to cause 25\u00a0000 deaths in the \nEU every year.\n\nEnvironmental health inequities\n\nThe most vulnerable people in our society are hardest \nhit by environmental stressors. Socially deprived \ncommunities are exposed to a higher burden of \npollution, with citizens in poorer European regions \nexposed to high levels of air pollution and noise and to \nhigh temperatures. Poorer people, children, the elderly \nand people with ill health are more negatively affected \nthan others by environmental health hazards. Higher \nlevels of exposure to environmental stressors and the \ngreater burden of health impacts exacerbate existing \nhealth inequities.\n\n\u2022 Poorer people are disproportionately exposed to air \npollution and extreme weather, including heatwaves \nand extreme cold. This is linked to where they live, \nwork and go to school, often in socially deprived \nurban neighbourhoods close to heavy traffic. \nDilapidated buildings allow outdoor air pollution \nto enter, are harder to keep at a comfortable \ntemperature and are more likely to be damp and \nmouldy.\n\n\u2022 For noise, the evidence is mixed, with exposure \nlinked to local factors, in particular road traffic \nlevels. In some cities, wealthier neighbourhoods \nare located in city centres, characterised by high \nnoise levels, while other city centres suffer social \ndeprivation.\n\n\u2022 With regard to chemicals, the patterns of \ninequalities in exposure can vary, depending on \nthe chemical, and are influenced by behaviours \nsuch as\u00a0product use, dietary preferences and \nsmoking, as\u00a0well as housing quality. However, no \ngroups escape chemical exposure, with exogenous \nchemicals detected in the blood and urine of over \n90\u00a0% of pregnant women and children sampled in \na\u00a0pan-European study.\n\n\u2022 Socially deprived people, children, the elderly and \nthose with ill health are less resilient in terms of \ncoping with or avoiding climate hazards, given that \nthey have fewer resources to heat or cool their \nhome and reduced mobility when faced with rising \nflood waters. Disadvantaged social groups take \nlonger to recover and restore their homes from the \n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n8 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nimpacts of floods and suffer greater mental health \nimpacts.\n\n\u2022 Certain groups are particularly sensitive to \nenvironmental stressors, including children, \npregnant women, the elderly and those suffering \nfrom ill health. In particular, exposure to certain \nhazardous chemicals during critical windows of \ndevelopment in foetuses and young children can \nlead to irreversible effects. High proportions of \npregnant women and children in European cities \nare exposed to air pollution and noise levels above \nhealth-based guidance values.\n\nGreen solutions offer a triple win \n\u2014 benefiting the environment, health \nand\u00a0society\n\nProtecting and restoring our environment, in \nparticular within cities, can deliver positive outcomes \nfor those living, working or spending their free time \nin these places. Green solutions, such as expanding \nhigh-quality green and blue spaces in urban areas, \noffer a 'triple win' by mitigating environmental pollution \nand supporting biodiversity, improving the health \nand well-being of urban populations and fostering \nsocial cohesion and integration. High-quality natural \nenvironments are a tool for disease prevention, \nreducing exposure to environmental stressors and \npromoting exercise, relaxation and social interaction \nin\u00a0support of health and well-being.\n\n\u2022 Reducing environmental pollution and creating \nhealthier environments will yield significant benefits \nfor the health of European citizens. While there are \nsome gaps in our knowledge regarding the health \neffects of environmental stressors, the evidence \nbase is sufficiently robust to justify taking action to \ntackle pollution today.\n\n\u2022 In addition to reducing the number of premature \ndeaths, access to healthier environments will also \nreduce the prevalence of health conditions that \naffect our daily quality of life, such as cardiovascular \ndisease, stroke, asthma, hypertension, dementia, \nstress and heat exposure.\n\n\u2022 High-quality natural environments offer health \nbenefits through physical activity, relaxation \nand restoration and social cohesion, and by \nsupporting the functioning of the immune system. \nThese pathways deliver improved mental health \nand cognitive function, reduced cardiovascular \nmorbidity, reduced prevalence of diabetes, \nimproved maternal and foetal outcomes and \noverall\u00a0reduced mortality.\n\n\u2022 Green and blue spaces in local neighbourhoods \nprovide particularly significant health and \nwell-being\u00a0benefits for low-income and deprived \nurban populations and can support the integration \nof marginalised social groups.\n\n\u2022 There is significant variation in the accessibility of \nurban green spaces across Europe, which is linked \nto urban structure. Socially deprived groups tend \nto have reduced access to urban green space, with \nhigher house prices in greener residential areas \nbeing a factor that drives unequal access.\n\n\u2022 Green infrastructure can mitigate environmental \nstressors. Green and blue spaces offer cooling \neffects to tackle the urban heat island effect, and \nalleviate flooding. More stable urban temperatures \nreduce energy requirements for buildings. Green \nspaces can also reduce noise, particularly in built-up \nareas.\n\nIntegrated approaches to environment \nand health\n\nTraditional approaches to the environment and health \nhave predominantly focused on individual hazards \nin compartmentalised environmental media. Today, \nthere is recognition that the dynamic between the \nenvironment, health and well-being is complex, with \nexposure to multiple stressors leading to combined \neffects, mediated by social status. The upstream drivers \nof environmental degradation are interconnected and \nmay themselves have an impact on public health. For \nexample, dependency on vehicular transport leads to \nsedentary lifestyles and associated ill health, as well as \nemissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases.\n\nBehaviour, diet and consumer choices play a significant \nrole in mediating exposure to some environmental \nstressors and are influenced and sometimes \nconstrained by socio-economic status. For example, \nfuel poverty is linked to the use of solid fuels for indoor \nheating and cooking, leading to poor indoor and \nambient air quality.\n\nAnother challenge emerges from the fact that \nthe drivers of environmental degradation may be \ndislocated in time and place from health outcomes. \nThis is the case for climate change, emissions of \ntransboundary pollutants \u2014 in particular persistent \norganic pollutants \u2014 and biodiversity loss. Such \nissues require coordinated international action, \ncomplemented by local efforts to raise awareness \nand support adaptive measures to reduce exposure \nto environmental stressors. Examples may include \nproviding advice to local communities on avoiding \n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n9Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ngrowing vegetables in contaminated soil or promoting \ngreen space to mitigate the local effects of climate \nchange. Similarly, integrated policies on urban \ntransport and mobility can create multiple benefits, \nsuch as improving air quality, reducing noise exposure, \nincreasing the availability of green spaces, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and increasing activity levels \nthrough cycling and walking for leisure and commuting.\n\nThe unequal impact of environmental pollution and \ndegradation on socially deprived communities and \nvulnerable groups needs to be systematically addressed \nacross policy domains. Universal measures to deliver \noverall reductions in exposure to environmental \nstressors for the general population can be \ncomplemented by measures targeted at groups known \nto be vulnerable in terms of their increased exposure, \nincreased sensitivity or reduced resilience. At\u00a0European \nlevel, options to target socio-environmental inequalities \nthrough the EU Cohesion Fund and the European Social \nFund exist, since environmental inequalities follow \nthe pattern of socio-demographic inequalities across \nEurope. At the local level, integrating environmental \nhealth concerns into welfare policies, health policies, \nand urban planning and housing policies can help to \nreduce the vulnerability and exposure of the population.\n\nHealth policies can also directly tackle the \nenvironmental, economic and social determinants \nof health, with the potential to reduce the burden of \ndisease in the long term. In 2016, only 3\u00a0% of health \nexpenditure was allocated to disease prevention. \nThere is significant potential to reduce mortality \nand morbidity linked to environmental conditions \nby raising awareness among exposed communities, \nmitigating environmental stressors, supporting healthy \nbehaviours, facilitating choices to use cleaner fuels \nand providing access to high-quality environments, \nin\u00a0particular for socially deprived communities.\n\nThe need to tackle the upstream drivers \nof environmental degradation\n\nAt the same time, human activity continues to damage \nthe European environment. Unless we make some \nfundamental changes to the key societal systems \nthat drive environmental and climatic pressures, \n\nthe prospects for our society are not positive. These \nkey systems include our food, energy, mobility and \nproduction systems, as well as our consumption \npatterns and ways of life. Given the inherent links \nto human behaviour and consumption patterns, new \ncitizen science initiatives provide a useful means of \ngathering data, engaging the public, and increasing \nawareness and action at the local and individual level.\n\nThe European Green Deal represents a sea change in \nthe European policy agenda and sets out a sustainable \nand inclusive strategy to improve people's health \nand quality of life, care for nature, and leave no \none behind. This includes a 'zero pollution Europe' \nambition to protect citizens' health from environmental \ndegradation, including air pollution, water pollution, \nnoise and chemicals. This is complemented by the goal \nof achieving climate neutrality by 2050, an ambition \nthat will require action across a range of systems and \npolicy areas. Finally, the transition should be socially \njust, leaving nobody behind.\n\nAchieving these goals at European level will require \nan integrated approach, with environmental and \nsustainability considerations being systemically \naddressed across policy areas. There are conflicting \npolicy objectives, even within the environmental \ndomain, where trade-offs need to be resolved. For \nexample, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nthrough the use of renewable biomass or through \nenergy-efficient buildings with reduced ventilation \ncan increase exposure to ambient and indoor air \npollution. Pharmaceuticals are used extensively to \nsupport good health, while their release into the \nenvironment can have an impact on ecosystems, \nand, in the case of antibiotics, generate antimicrobial \nresistance. More broadly, economic growth is the \nprincipal means of poverty alleviation, but it is \ncurrently driven by unsustainable consumption \nand production, the root\u00a0cause of environmental \ndegradation.\n\nThe integration of environmental health concerns \nacross a broad range of policy domains is critical to \nbringing about the changes needed to reduce exposure \nto environmental stressors and to fully realise the \nbenefits that nature offers to support the health and \nwell-being of the European population.\n\f\nHealthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe10\n\nCOVID-19 \u2014 considerations for environmental health  \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic provides a stark example \nof the inextricable links between human health and \necosystem health. This novel disease is thought to have \nemerged in bat populations, subsequently jumping \nspecies to infect humans in a seafood and animal \nmarket. The emergence of such zoonotic pathogens \nis linked to environmental degradation and human \ninteractions with animals in the food system. Other \nfactors, such as exposure to air pollution and social \nstatus, seem to affect transmission and mortality rates \nin ways that are not yet fully understood.\n\nAside from the emergence of COVID-19, other \ndimensions of our environment and our social \norganisation interplay with COVID-19 in ways that are \nnot yet fully understood. These include environmental \nand social factors that influence human vulnerability \nand susceptibility to the disease, and in turn the \nenvironmental consequences of measures taken by \nsociety to manage the outbreak. It is clear that water, \nsanitation and hygiene facilities are key to preventing \nthe spread of COVID-19, with waste water monitoring \nemerging as an effective tool for tracking the circulation \nof the virus.\n\nThe emergence of COVID-19 \n\nIn December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of \nunknown origin was identified in Wuhan, China. The \nvirus was subsequently identified and named severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), \nwith the resulting disease labelled coronavirus disease \n2019 (COVID-19). The cluster was associated with a \nseafood and animal market, suggesting the disease \nwas zoonotic in origin, meaning that it was transmitted \nto humans from animals. Zoonotic diseases emerge \nwhen a human is infected with novel microorganisms \ntransferred from an animal reservoir, with transmission \noften occurring via an intermediary host, such as insect \nvectors or domesticated animals (UNEP, 2020). \n\nThe exact origin and natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 \npresently remains unknown, although bats have been \nconsidered likely suspects given the high prevalence \nof coronavirus in wild bat populations and similarities \nwith the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (Wu, Y.C., et al., \n\n2020). SARS-CoV-2 is the third known zoonotic \ncoronavirus to infect humans in recent years. An \nearlier coronavirus, SARS-CoV, appeared in late 2002, \ntransmitted to humans via masked palm civets. It \ncaused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome (SARS) that spread out of China to affect \n26 countries (WHO, 2020a). In the second instance, \nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus \n(MERS-CoV), which was transmitted to humans via \ndromedary camels, was detected in the Middle East \nin 2012 and spread to 27\u00a0countries (WHO, 2019a). \nBoth viruses are believed to have originated in bats \n(Mackenzie and Smith, 2020).\n\nAbout 60\u00a0% of human infectious diseases are of \nanimal origin (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, \n2005), while three quarters of new and emerging \ninfectious diseases are transmitted to humans from \nanimals (Taylor et al.,\u00a02001). These include viruses \nresponsible for significant global mortality, such as \nthe human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) HIV-1 \nand HIV-2 that cause acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) and emerged from wild primate \npopulations, the Rift Valley fever virus that jumped \nfrom infected livestock to humans, as well as \ninfluenza viruses that have emerged from domestic \nanimals, in particular pigs and poultry, such as bird \nflu and swine flu. Other zoonotic diseases associated \nwith particularly high fatality rates include the Ebola \nvirus, Hantaviruses and Nipah virus (Wolf et al., 2005). \nIn the mid-fourteenth century, the bubonic plague \nkilled a third of Europe\u2019s population, caused by the \nbacteria Yersinia pestis and transmitted to humans \nfrom rodents via fleas (UNEP, 2020).\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, the \nmost commonly reported zoonoses in humans \nwere campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, Shiga \ntoxin-producing Escherichia coli and Yersiniosis, all \nof which have reservoirs in domesticated animals \nwith transmission to humans associated with the \nconsumption of contaminated food of animal \norigin. Of note, a large increase in human West Nile \nvirus infections was reported in Europe in 2018, \ntransmitted via the bites of mosquitos that had fed \non infected wild birds (European Centre for Disease \nPrevention and Control, 2018).\n\nCOVID-19 \u2014 considerations for environmental\nhealth\n\f\nCOVID-19 \u2014 considerations for environmental health  \n\n11Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nNovel viruses have emerged from intensive systems of \ndomestic livestock rearing, where human and animal \npathogens circulate and in some cases amplify. The \nintensive production of animal protein involves rearing \nconcentrated populations of genetically similar animals \nin close proximity, often in poor conditions, fostering \nvulnerability to infection (UNEP, 2020). More than 50\u00a0% \nof zoonotic infectious diseases that have emerged since \n1940 have been associated with measures to intensify \nagriculture, including dams, irrigation projects and \nfactory farms (Rohr et al, 2019). \n\nThe use of land to produce animal feed is a key \ndriver of deforestation (Nepstad et al., 2014). There \nis a clear link between tropical deforestation and the \nemergence of zoonotic viruses from reservoirs in \nwildlife. Forest clearance for roadbuilding, mining and \nagriculture, along with the hunting of wildlife for meat \nand traditional medicine, and the use of wildlife as \npets, all result in a greater frequency of human-wildlife \ninteractions that can provide a launch pad for novel \nhuman viruses (Dobson et al, 2020). Land use change, \nincluding the conversion of natural ecosystems for \nagriculture or urban development, has been found \nto impact species diversity and abundance, favouring \nanimal species that act as reservoirs for zoonotic \n\ndisease, in particular rodents, bats and passerine birds. \nAs such, global changes in land use are expanding \nthe interfaces between people, livestock and the \nwildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease (Gibb et al, 2020) \n(see\u00a0Figure 0.1). \n\nIn their recent report, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme and the International Livestock Research \nInstitute (2020) identify seven major anthropogenic \ndrivers of zoonotic disease emergence, including: \n\n\u2022 Increased demand for animal protein;\n\n\u2022 Unsustainable agricultural intensification;\n\n\u2022 Increased use and exploitation of wildlife;\n\n\u2022 Unsustainable utilisation of natural resources \naccelerated by urbanisation, land use change and \nextractive industries;\n\n\u2022 Travel and transportation;\n\n\u2022 Changes in food supply chains;\n\n\u2022 Climate change.\n\nFigure 0.1 Zoonotic disease transmission at the interface between humans, livestock and wildlife\n\nSource: Adapted from Jones et al.

Recognising the potential for zoonotic disease \nto spill across these compartments, the management \nof human and ecosystem health requires an integrated \napproach built upon knowledge created through \nmulti-disciplinary collaboration. There is a need to \nimprove our understanding not just of the pathogens \nthat cause disease, but also the complex environmental \nand social dimensions that influence the spread of \ndisease. Increased surveillance of zoonotic disease \nacross different habitats is needed to understand \nthe role that environmental degradation plays in \ndriving disease emergence. Finally, the severity of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic should renew efforts to address \nthe drivers of emerging infectious disease, in particular \nthe structure of the food system and demand for \nanimal protein (UNEP, 2020).  \n\nVulnerability and susceptibility \nto\u00a0COVID-19\n\nResearchers are exploring the role that air \npollution may play in influencing the severity of \nCOVID-19. Exposure to air pollution is associated \nwith cardiovascular and respiratory disease, both \npre-existing health conditions identified as risk factors \nfor death in COVID-19 patients (Yang et al., 2020). As \nsuch, long term exposure to air pollution might be \nexpected to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in \nindividuals, with previous studies having, for example, \ndemonstrated a role for exposure to particulate \nmatter (PM) in worsening the impact of respiratory \nviruses (Sciomer et al., 2020).\u00a0 \n\nSome recent studies have explored the evidence for \nlinks between air pollution and high mortality rates for \nCOVID-19. An Italian study argued that since long-term \nexposure to air pollution, including PM, ozone (O3) and \nsulfur dioxide (SO2), weakens the immune defences \nof the upper airways, this would facilitate entry of \nthe SARS-CoV-2 into the lower airways resulting in \ninfection with COVID-19. They therefore suggest \nthat air pollution should be considered a co-factor in \nthe high level of fatality in Northern Italy (Conticini, \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02020).\n\nAn additional study significantly correlated air \npollution over the past 4 years with cases of COVID-19 \nin up to 71\u00a0Italian provinces and suggested that \nchronic exposure provides a favourable context for \nthe spread of the virus (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020). \nA\u00a0US study explored associations between long-term \n\nexposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and an \nincreased risk of death from COVID-19 in the US, and \nfound a small increase in concentration (1 \u03bcg/m3) \nto be associated with an 8\u00a0% increase in the death \nrate (Wu, X., et al., 2020). In follow up, a similar study \nfrom the Netherlands investigated the relationship \nbetween long-term exposure and COVID-19 in 355 \nDutch municipalities and found a 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m3\u00a0 increase in \nPM2.5 concentrations to be associated with an increase \nin the death rate of between 13\u00a0% and 21.4\u00a0% (Cole, \net\u00a0al., 2020). Finally, an English study found deaths from \nCOVID-19 to be more common in highly polluted areas, \nalthough the correlation between the risk of death and \npollution weakened as the disease spread out of urban \nareas. The analysis found that long-term exposure to \nPM2.5 could increase the risk of contracting and dying \nfrom COVID-19 by up to 7\u00a0%. Of note, over one third \nof the patients that died from COVID-19 suffered from \npre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease \n(Office for National Statistics, 2020).\n\nOf relevance, an earlier study assessed the influence \nof long- and short-term exposure to air pollution \non mortality rates in China during the 2003 SARS \noutbreak and demonstrated a positive association \nbetween air pollution and fatality. Patients from \nregions with poor air quality were twice as likely to die \nas those from regions with low levels of air pollution, \nwith associations found for both long- and short-term \nexposure (Cui, Y. et al., 2003). \n\nThere are, however, a number of significant limitations \nwith these early studies and so findings need to \nbe interpreted with care. Such limitations include \nthe frequent lack of reliable and consistent data on \nmortality rates in different regions, and challenges \nin effectively controlling for numerous confounding \nfactors, such as government measures to control \ntransmission, population structure, international \nconnectivity of the community, and social and \nindividual behaviours such as smoking. Spatial \ncoincidence alone cannot be taken as causality, with \nfurther epidemiological research required to elucidate \npossible causal associations between past exposure to \nair pollution and COVID-19 health impacts.\n\nAn additional public health question, also currently \nbeing researched, is whether particulate matter \ncan transport the virus. In Italy, genetic material \nfrom the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected on PM \nsamples from the city of Bergamo in Northern Italy \n(Setti, et al., 2020). While there are some concerns \nthat air pollution could carry the virus over longer \ndistances and drive infection, at this stage it is not \nknown whether the virus remains viable on pollution \nparticles. Again, further research is required.\n\f\nCOVID-19 \u2014 considerations for environmental health  \n\n13Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nChemical exposure has been indirectly linked to \nvulnerability to COVID-19. Certain chemicals are \nassociated with health impacts such as obesity, \ncardiovascular diseases, immunotoxicity and \nrespiratory diseases that have, in turn, been found \nto increase susceptibility to COVID-19. As such, the \nassumption is that individuals with such pre-existing \nhealth conditions resulting from chemical exposure \nmay have increased susceptibility to COVID-19. In this \ncontext, a recent study has suggested that long-term, \nlow-dose exposure to mixtures of chemicals may lead \nto immunodeficiency in the face of epidemics and \npandemics (Tsatsakis, et al., 2020).  \n\nIn terms of the role of social factors in the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, residents in care homes are \na particularly vulnerable population group. At the \nsame time, emerging evidence suggests that deprived \ncommunities are more likely to contract COVID-19. \nIn a recent Swedish study, 4.1\u00a0% of residents of a \nhigh-income area of Stockholm tested positive for \nSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, in contrast to 30\u00a0% of \nresidents of a low-income area. Possible explanations \nfor the difference include cramped housing \nconditions, working conditions and challenges for \nmigrant communities in understanding public health \nadvice delivered in Swedish (Lundkvist et al., 2020). \nA Spanish study assessed the relationship between \nincome and incidence of COVID-19 in Barcelona and \nfound that districts with the lowest mean income \nhad the highest incidence of COVID-19, with the \nlowest income district exhibiting an incidence 2.5 \ntimes greater than that of the highest income district \n(Baena-D\u00edez et al., 2020). \n\nSeveral factors may increase the vulnerability of \npeople of low socio-economic status, both in terms of \nexposure to the virus and the severity of outcomes. \nIn terms of exposure, poorer people are more likely \nto live in poor quality, overcrowded accommodation, \njeopardising compliance with social distancing \nrecommendations and increasing the risk of \ntransmitting infection. Secondly, poorer people often \nhave jobs that cannot be carried out from home, such \nas working in healthcare, care homes, supermarkets, \nfactories, warehouses, and public transport. Thirdly, \npoorer people are more likely to have unstable work \nconditions and face financial uncertainty due to the \neconomic impacts of the response to COVID-19. \nSuch individuals face significant pressures to \ncontinue working even when ill, in order to safeguard \nhousehold incomes. This can influence the severity \nof outcomes, whereby sustained stress weakens the \nimmune system, increasing susceptibility to a range of \ndiseases (Patel, et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, poorer people \nin urban areas are likely to be exposed to higher levels \n\nof air pollution and noise, associated with respiratory \nand cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension \nrespectively (EEA, 2018a), while hypertension and \ndiabetes are directly associated with poverty. These \nconditions are all risk factors for death from COVID-19 \n(Yang et al., 2020), suggesting that people of low \nsocio-economic status have an increased susceptibility \nto COVID-19 mortality (Patel, et al., 2020). \n\nThere is emerging evidence that ethnicity may play \na role in vulnerability to COVID-19, with black, Asian \nand minority ethnic (BAME) individuals at an increased \nrisk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to \nwhite individuals, and of worse clinical outcomes \nfrom COVID-19 (Pan et al., 2020). The English study \nmentioned above found ethnicity to be strongly \ncorrelated with pollution exposure, with BAME \nindividuals more likely to live in polluted inner-city \nareas than their white counterparts. However, air \npollution was not thought to be the sole driver \nbehind disparities in mortality rates across ethnic \ngroups (Office for National Statistics, 2020). Further \nresearch is required to disentangle the respective \nroles of ethnicity and air pollution in driving COVID-19 \ninfection and mortality rates.  \n\nAcross Europe, particular concern is increasingly \nfocused on the most vulnerable, who may already \nstruggle with pre-existing health conditions and \nhigh levels of stress, and in some cases have limited \naccess to sanitation, making good hand hygiene more \ndifficult. This includes homeless people, migrants and \nasylum seekers living both informally and in reception \ncamps, prison populations and disadvantaged Roma \ncommunities. \n\nPrevention and surveillance \u2013 the role \nof\u00a0WASH\n\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted \nthe essential role of water, sanitation and hygiene \n(WASH) in preventing the spread of COVID-19, with \nfrequent and correct hand hygiene one of the most \nimportant measures to prevent infection. Ensuring \nthe availability of WASH and, in particular, sustained \naccess to hand hygiene facilities in communities, \nhomes, schools, marketplaces, and healthcare facilities \nwill help prevent human-to-human transmission of \nSARS-CoV-2 (WHO, 2020b).\n\nRegarding the question of whether the virus can \nbe transmitted via water, existing research finds no \nindication that SARS-CoV-2 can persist in drinking water. \nTo date, neither untreated nor treated sewage have \nbeen reported as a route of infection (WHO, 2020b).\n\f\nCOVID-19 \u2014 considerations for environmental health  \n\n14 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nMonitoring untreated waste waters is emerging as \na tool in public health surveillance for COVID-19, \nproviding a good indicator of the presence of \nthe virus in a population. Studies in a number of \ncountries have detected fragments of SARS-CoV-2 \nRNA in untreated sewage and sludge (La Rosa, G., \net al., 2020, Medema et al., 2020, Peccia et al., 2020, \nRandazzo et al., 2020, RIVM, 2020). Researchers have \nestablished that the concentration of viral RNA in \nuntreated sewage increases with the level of infection \nin the catchment population (Medema et al., 2020). \nIn addition, results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA \nconcentration in wastewater is a leading indicator of \ncommunity infection, ahead of COVID-19 testing data \nand local hospital admissions (Peccia et al., 2020). As \nan example, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in waste \nwater dating from before the first cases were reported \nin Spain (Randazzo et al., 2020). This suggests \nthat waste water surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can \ncomplement public health data as a sensitive tool for \ntracking the circulation of the virus in urban areas in \nEurope, as well as providing an early warning indicator \nof re-emergence.\n\nIn order to support and coordinate these efforts, the \nEuropean Commission has launched a pan-European \nUmbrella Study to assess the feasibility of developing \na waste water monitoring system for SARS-CoV-2. \nThe activity aims to exchange knowledge and \ndevelop standardised analytical methods and data \ninterpretation to allow for comparison across ongoing \nresearch activities, with 20 countries involved to date \n(JRC, 2020).\n\nImpacts of measures to control COVID-19 \ntransmission\n\nThe lockdown measures put in place to control the \ntransmission of COVID-19 have had implications for \nenvironmental health. The requirement to stay at \nhome can negatively impact on health and mental \nwell-being: the extent to which such impacts may \noccur can depend on the size of the home and the \nnumber of residents, access to personal outdoor \nspace and access to green and blue spaces in the \nlocal area. Wealthier households are more likely to \nhave private gardens and live in leafy suburbs with \naccess to parks. In terms of chemical exposure, the \npandemic-induced confinement increases exposure \nto indoor air pollution. Concerns with the overuse \nand/or misuse of disinfectants and other indoor \nchemical exposure which could also affect health \nhave been raised in certain scientific communities. \nAt\u00a0this stage, there is little hard data to back up these \nsuggestions, and further research is\u00a0required.\n\nIn terms of how lockdown measures have impacted \nenvironmental conditions in Europe, reductions \nin economic and social activities led to significant \ndecreases in certain types of pollution. Across Europe, \nthe lockdown measures resulted in large decreases in \nair pollutant concentrations \u2014 nitrogen dioxide (NO2) \nconcentrations in particular \u2014 largely due to reduced \ntraffic and other activities, especially in major cities. \nThe extent of reductions varied considerably, with \nthe largest reductions of up to 70\u00a0% seen in urban \ncentres in those countries most affected countries by \nCOVID-19 in the spring of 2020, namely Spain, Italy \nand France. Concentrations of coarse particulate \nmatter (PM10) also fell across Europe, although to a \nlesser extent than NO2. The greatest reductions are \nestimated to have been in cities in Spain and Italy \n(EEA, forthcoming). These reductions were short lived, \nwith levels of air pollution rebounding as lockdowns \nwere eased and vehicular transport resumed \nacross\u00a0Europe. \n\nIt is likely that there has also been a significant drop in \nnoise levels during the COVID-19 lockdown, as noise \npollution from traffic are typically correlated with NO2 \nlevels. While we have grown accustomed to unhealthy \nnoise levels in cities, the short-term reduction in noise \nduring lockdown allowed people to experience the \nimmediate benefits of quieter cities. \n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has also had a direct impact \non global and EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nalthough we will only be able to fully quantify its \nmagnitude after 2020.\n\nHowever, as economic activity picks up these \nshort-term environmental benefits are likely to be \nreversed. Improving environmental health requires \nlong-term systemic change to the upstream drivers of \nenvironmental pollution, including our mobility, food, \nand production and consumption systems. \n\nThe lockdown has changed working conditions for \nmany people, with a significant increase in the number \nof people working from home and a reduction in \nbusiness travel. Knock-on effects may include an \nincrease in demand for housing outside of city \ncentres. In many cities, road space was allocated \nto cyclists and pedestrians during the lockdowns \nwhen traffic levels fell. These factors are feeding into \ndiscussions on how to increase the sustainability \nand resilience of cities and avoid a return to preCOVID-19 \u2018business as usual\u2019. At the same time, \nconcerns regarding transmission of COVID-19 on \npublic transport may lead to an increase in the use of \nprivate vehicles for daily commutes, as people seek to \navoid\u00a0exposure.\n\f\nCOVID-19 \u2014 considerations for environmental health  \n\n15Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFinally, the use of personal protective equipment \nin healthcare facilities, care homes and other \nfront-line activities, as well as public use of masks, \nnow mandatory in certain countries and contexts, \nhas driven a sharp increase in the use of single-use \nplastics and resulting waste. In addition, the low price \nof crude oil has reduced demand for recycled plastics, \nas virgin plastic can be produced at a lower cost.\n\nEU response to COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is testing social resilience \nin Europe. In terms of the immediate response, \nthe European Commission recently published a \ncommunication on 'Short-term EU health preparedness \nfor COVID-19 outbreaks' (EC, 2020a), setting out \nlessons learnt to date and outlining key measures \nto be taken in the coming months. Regarding public \nhealth surveillance for COVID-19, the communication \nrecommends that activities explore changes in the \nprevalence across risk groups, including investigating \nthe role of environmental exposure. It calls for the \ncreation of an open access EU level register for the \nprevention and reduction of epidemiological risks, to \ncover the environmental determinants of health. The \ncommunication also recognises the role, within public \nhealth surveillance, of monitoring COVID-19 residues \nin wastewaters, with action already underway to \ncoordinate and harmonise monitoring activities. The \nEuropean Commission is also investing in research to \nprepare for and respond to this type of public health \nemergency, with two research calls to date focussed \non COVID-19 under the EU research and innovation \nprogramme, Horizon 2020.\n\nFor the longer term, with the European Green Deal \nthe European Commission has already proposed \nan ambitious and just transition towards long-term \nsustainability, placing environment and climate \nconcerns at its centre. It recognises how good \nhealth is inextricably connected to the state of our \nenvironment and aims to protect the health and \nwell-being of citizens from environment-related \n\nrisks and impacts (EC, 2019). Major policy packages, \nincluding the recently proposed Biodiversity Strategy \n(EC, 2020b) and the Farm to Fork\u00a0Strategy (EC, 2020c), \nhave been put forward to implement this vision. A \nforthcoming initiative, expected in 2021, will detail the \nzero-pollution ambition for Europe. \n\nThese priorities are also clearly reflected in the \nmulti-annual EU budget proposal of EUR 1.1 trillion \nfor 2021-2027. As part of a recovery plan from \nthis economic crisis, a new, additional financial \ninstrument called 'Next Generation EU', amounting \nto EUR 750\u00a0billion, was recently proposed by the \nEuropean Commission. Framed within well-defined \npolicy targets, these funds can help Europe transform \nits economy while achieving climate-neutrality and \nsustainability, and addressing social inequalities \n(EC, 2020d). The delivery of ambitions to tackle the \nsystemic interlinkages across environmental and \necosystem health will require collaboration across a \nbroad range of policy areas and at multiple levels of \ngovernance. \n\nAt global level, in May 2020 the World Health \nOrganization issued the 'WHO manifesto for a healthy \nrecovery from COVID-19' that sets out the lessons \nlearnt from COVID-19 and identifies key elements of \na healthy, green recovery. These include protecting \nnature, making cities more liveable and improving \nessential services, as well as addressing the upstream \ndrivers of poor environmental health by promoting \nsustainable energy and food systems, and eliminating \nsubsidies for fossil fuels (WHO, 2020c).\n\nRegarding the prevention of future zoonotic \ninfectious disease, the One Health approach provides \na framework for communication and cooperation \nacross multiple sectors as a means of integrating \nhuman, animal and environmental health, explicitly \naddressing the connections across these domains. \nThe need to respond to the current crisis, and \nto prevent future pandemics, provides a strong \nrationale for an integrated approach to human and \nenvironmental\u00a0health.  \n\f\nHealthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe16\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1 The environment, health and \nwell-being nexus\n\nThe health and well-being of European citizens are \ndetermined by aspects of their everyday life, including \neconomic circumstances, social dynamics and the \nquality of their natural and living environments. These \ndifferent dimensions are not isolated but interact in a \ncomplex nexus to deliver a living experience specific \nto each individual. This report explores the influence \nof the environment on health and well-being, and how \nsocio-economic factors mediate this influence.\n\nSpending time in high-quality natural environments \nfosters good health and well-being (Pr\u00fcss-Ust\u00fcn et al., \n2016; ten Brink et al., 2016; Lovell et al., 2018). Nature \nsupports life through a broad range of ecosystem \nservices, including provisioning services, such as fresh \nwater, regulating services, such as pollination and \nclimate regulation, and cultural services that provide \nopportunities for recreation and relaxation.\n\nAt the same time, a significant proportion of the burden \nof disease in Europe is attributed to environmental \npollution resulting from human activity. Data from \nthe World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that \nin\u00a02012, environmental stressors were responsible \nfor at least 13 % of all deaths in the 28 Member States \nof the EU (EU-28), which equates to a total of 630 000 \ndeaths attributable to the environment (WHO, 2016a). \nJust over a third of cases of ischaemic heart disease \nand 42\u00a0% of strokes could be prevented by reducing \nor removing exposure to chemicals from ambient air \npollution, household air pollution, second-hand smoke \nand lead (Pr\u00fcss-Ust\u00fcn et al., 2016). At a global level, \na\u00a0recent assessment attributed 16\u00a0% of total mortality \nto pollution-related disease (Landrigan et al., 2018). \nIn\u00a0the EU, air pollution and extreme weather conditions \nare recognised as risk factors driving excess mortality \n(OECD and EU, 2018). In this context, preventing \nexposure to environmental risks would significantly \nreduce the environmental burden of disease.\n\nWhile all citizens are affected by environment risks, \nsocially disadvantaged and vulnerable groups are \ndisproportionally affected, exacerbating existing \ninequalities (WHO Europe, 2019a). Socially deprived \n\n1 Introduction\n\ncommunities are exposed to a higher burden of \npollution, with citizens in poorer European regions \nexposed to high levels of air pollution and noise and \nto high temperatures. In addition, groups of lower \nsocio-economic status tend to be more negatively \naffected by these environmental health hazards \n(EEA,\u00a02018a).\n\nPeople with pre-existing health conditions, children \nand the elderly are more sensitive to the impact of \nenvironmental stressors, such as air pollution and \nnoise. Poorer communities are also more vulnerable, \nbeing less able to afford to protect themselves from \nenvironmental stressors, for example by installing air \nconditioning during hot summers. They are less likely \nto restore their homes after flooding or move to a new \nhouse to avoid future floods (EEA, 2018a). As a result, \npoorer communities are more exposed, sensitive and \nvulnerable to environmental risks, less resilient in terms \nof adapting to and avoiding risks, and recover more \nslowly from the impacts of environmental stressors.\n\nGiven their increased vulnerability, poorer communities \nbenefit significantly from the benefits offered by access \nto high-quality environments. This is particularly true \nfor people in socially deprived urban communities, \nwho tend to live in densely populated urban spaces, \nwith reduced access to the benefits of high-quality \nenvironments in Europe (WHO Europe, 2019a). In many \nEuropean countries, the disproportionate exposure of \nlower socio-economic groups to air pollution, noise and \nhigh temperatures occurs in urban areas (EEA, 2018a).\n\nDemographics play an important role in determining \nthe distribution of environmental health impacts. \nAcross Europe, the elderly, children and those with \npoor health tend to be more adversely affected \nby environmental health hazards than the general \npopulation. There are also environmental inequalities \nlinked to ethnicity, with Roma communities in Central \nand Eastern Europe often excluded from basic \nservices and exposed to environmental pollution, with \nserious health consequences (Heidegger and Wiese, \n2020). Individual behaviours also influence exposure \nand sensitivity to environmental stressors (Staatsen \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). For example, dietary choices influence \nexposure to chemicals, while smoking can make an \n\f\nIntroduction\n\n17Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nindividual more vulnerable to the health impacts of air \npollution.\n\nIn 2013, the European Environment Agency (EEA) and \nthe European Commission's Joint Research Centre\u00a0(JRC) \nproduced a joint report on the environment and \nhealth and concluded that an approach focused on \ncontrolling single environmental hazards is insufficient \nto address interconnected challenges such as climate \nchange, ecosystem degradation, the obesity epidemic \nand persistent social inequality. The report called for \nan integrated approach to assessing the environment, \nhealth and well-being nexus, one that recognises \nthe impact of multiple environmental stressors and \ncaptures social dimensions, consumption patterns \nand\u00a0the benefits delivered by the environment \n(EEA\u00a0and\u00a0JRC, 2013).\n\n1.2 The policy framework for \nenvironment, health and well-being\n\nThe 2030 agenda for sustainable development, adopted \nby all United Nations (UN) Member States in 2015, sets \nout goals and targets for action over the next decade. \nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) address \nmultiple aspects of human development, including \nimproved health, poverty alleviation, education, reduced \ninequality and economic growth, environmental \nquality and the urgent need to tackle climate change. \nSDG\u00a03 aims to guarantee good health and well-being \nfor all at all ages, with a particular focus on reducing \nmaternal and child mortality. It includes the goal of \nending the epidemic of communicable disease and \nreducing premature mortality from non-communicable \ndiseases by one third through prevention and \ntreatment. In particular, it aims to deliver a substantial \nreduction in deaths and illnesses stemming from \nhazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution \nand contamination, recognising that\u00a0environmental \nimprovements deliver improved health.\n\nIn fact, as shown in Figure 1.1, the environmental \nand social determinants of health are themes that \nthread through the SDGs, providing opportunities for \nsynergies in planning actions to deliver on relevant \ngoals and targets. At the same time, there are also \nconflicts across the SDGs that demand trade-offs. In \nparticular, the current paradigm of economic growth \ndriven by increasing consumption and production has \ndelivered poverty alleviation but at the same time has \nalso driven environmental degradation (EEA, 2019a).\n\nAt the pan-European level, the European environment \nand health process brings together policymakers from \nthe health and the environment domains to shape \npolicies and actions on the environment and health. \n\nAgreed in 2017, the Ostrava Declaration summarises \nthe priorities in these areas in the WHO European \nregion, resolving to protect and promote health and \nwell-being and prevent premature deaths, diseases \nand inequalities related to environmental pollution and \ndegradation (WHO Europe, 2017a).\n\nIn the EU, the ambitious new agenda of the European \nCommission, the European Green Deal, recognises \nthat good health is closely connected to the state of \nour environment and aims to protect the health and \nwell-being of citizens from environment-related risks \nand impacts. Under the European Green Deal, the \nFarm to Fork Strategy aims to deliver a sustainable \nfood system that will yield environment and health \nbenefits, as well as securing livelihoods for European \nfarmers (EC,\u00a02020b). The recent EU Biodiversity Strategy \nfor 2030 highlights the importance of nature for our \nmental and physical wellbeing, as well as for social \nresilience, and identifies the urgent need to protect and \nrestore nature in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic \n(EC, 2020c). The need to reduce the environmental \nimpacts of production and consumption is recognised \nby the Circular Economy Action Plan, which aims to \nprevent waste and promote circularity in production \nprocesses, while ensuring the delivery of safe and \nsustainable products to European consumers \n(EC,\u00a02020e).\n\nRegarding action on climate change, the Commission \nproposes to enshrine the objective of reaching climate \nneutrality by 2050 in legislation, and increase the EU's \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions target for 2030 \n(EC, 2020f). On adaptation, the European Green Deal \nrecognises the role of nature-based solutions.\n\nThe agenda includes a zero pollution ambition for \na\u00a0toxic-free environment, to be delivered through an \naction plan for air, water and soil, as well as a chemicals \nstrategy for sustainability. It aims to accelerate the shift \nto sustainable and smart mobility, providing users with \ncleaner, healthier transport alternatives. The agenda \nalso calls for a\u00a0just and inclusive transition that leaves \nnobody behind (EC, 2019a).\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that a 'high level  human \nhealth protection shall be ensured in the definition \nand implementation of all Union policies and activities' \n(EU,\u00a02007). Member States are primarily responsible for \norganising and delivering health services and medical \ncare, with EU action complementing national action \nand ensuring that health protection is embedded in all \nEU policies. The European Commission's 2013 staff \nworking document 'Investing in health' recognises \nthe inherent value of health as a dimension of human \ncapital and a precondition for economic prosperity. It \nnotes that disease prevention and health promotion \n\f\nIntroduction\n\n18 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\noffer significant public health gains and that addressing \nthe risk factors that determine a population's health \ncan reduce chronic disease and the associated \nhealthcare costs and prevent premature deaths. \n\nThe health-in-all-policies approach aims to influence \nthe environmental, economic and social determinants \nof health and has the potential to reduce the burden \nof disease in the long term (EC, 2013a).

The 7th EAP \nexplicitly recognises that sensitive or vulnerable groups \nmay be more affected by pollution, particularly in cities, \nand that green infrastructure and blue spaces can \ndeliver public health benefits (EU, 2013a).\n\nNevertheless, policies to address environmental health \nat EU level remain fragmented. Single environmental \nstressors are, for example, addressed through policies \nsuch as directives on air quality (EU, 2004, 2008a), the \nEnvironmental Noise Directive (EU, 2002) and the Water \nFramework Directive (EU, 2000). There is currently no \noverarching framework at EU level that can address \nthe complex interlinkages across policy domains that \nare relevant to the environment and health. Relevant \npolicy domains are those addressing the contextual \ndimensions that influence exposure to environmental \nrisks, such as social inequity and urban structure, and \nthe upstream sources of these risks, such as emissions \nfrom agriculture, industry, energy and transport.\n\nThe link between society, the environment and \nhealth has been touched on in recent cross-cutting \npolicy frameworks. The Urban Agenda for Europe \nacknowledges the structural dimensions of poverty \nin deprived urban neighbourhoods and calls for \nintegrated approaches to urban regeneration, with \na focus on air pollution and the social dimension of \nclimate adaptation strategies (EC, 2016a). The recent \nevaluation of the EU adaptation strategy highlights the \nareas in which the strategy may be able to deliver more \nin the future, including a focus on social vulnerability \nin adaptation policies and more explicit links between \nhealth and climate change (EC, 2018a). The EU green \ninfrastructure strategy emphasises the role that green \nspaces in urban areas play in building communities and \ncombating social exclusion (EC, 2013b).\n\n1.3 Objectives of this report\n\nThis report consolidates available evidence of how the \nquality of the environment influences our health and \nwell-being and explores how social factors mediate this \ninfluence, including social deprivation, behaviours and \nshifting demographics in Europe.\n\nThe overall goal of this report is to provide a knowledge \nbase to support the development of integrated policies \nthat address the environment, health and well-being \nnexus. The specific objectives of the report are as \nfollows:\n\n\u2022 to contextualise the influence of the environment \non health and well-being within a broader picture of \nhealth across Europe;\n\n\u2022 to assess the direct benefits that access to \nhigh-quality environments deliver for health and \nwell-being;\n\n\u2022 to review the social distribution of access to \nhigh-quality environments and the resulting benefits \nfor health and well-being;\n\n\u2022 to present the latest evidence on the health impacts \nof exposure to ambient and indoor air pollution, \nenvironmental noise, water pollution, climate \nchange, electromagnetic fields and chemicals in \nEurope, including a reflection on the latest evidence \nregarding the synergistic effects of multiple \nstressors on health;\n\n\u2022 to consider how social status mediates the impact \nof environmental stressors on health, including \nincreased exposure, sensitivity and vulnerability; \nthis includes a reflection on how individual \nbehaviours can influence both exposure and \nvulnerability to environmental stressors;\n\n\u2022 to reflect on the implications that this knowledge \nhas for policies in the environment, health and \nwell-being nexus, as well as broader sectoral \npolicies;\n\n\u2022 to identify gaps in knowledge and point to areas \nin\u00a0which further research is needed.\n\n1.4 Conceptual and analytical \napproach\n\nThe interactions through which the environment \ninfluences health and well-being and the dynamics \nthrough which social, economic and demographic \n\f\nIntroduction\n\n20 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nfactors mediate this influence are complex. To make \nsense of available evidence, practitioners in the field \nhave proposed a framework that depicts the multiple \nvariables at work within the environment, health \nand well-being nexus and that illustrates the causal \nrelationships between them. The ecosystems-enriched \ndrivers, pressures, state, exposure, effect, actions \n(eDPSEEA) model uses the concept of ecosystem \nservices to emphasise how the quality of the \nenvironment is critical to human health and well-being \n(Reis et al., 2015). The practical application of the model \nto policy making is considered in Box 1.1.\n\nThe eDPSEEA model is shown in Figure 1.2 and depicts \nhow upstream drivers influence the environmental \nstate, leading to exposures that, in turn, affect health, \neither positively or negatively. The model places the \nenvironment-health interaction in a socio-economic \ncontext, capturing the influence of factors such as \ndemography, social deprivation and behaviours. \nDimensions of social status that may either cause \ncertain groups to be vulnerable to environmental \nstressors or affect access to environmental benefits \nare\u00a0systematically explored in this report.\n\nThe causal chain, from drivers and pressures to health \nimpacts, may operate at multiple levels. For example, \nat the local level in a city, transport emissions drive \npoor air quality, which has an impact on the respiratory \nhealth of local residents. At the global level, emissions \nof greenhouse gases drive weather events related to \nclimate change, reducing agricultural production and \ncausing prices of staple foods to increase. \n\nDistinct environmental stressors may have common \nupstream drivers, enabling the identification of \nco-benefits in policy actions. For example, both noise and \nair pollution results from vehicular transport. Conversely, \n\ncertain solutions may entail trade-offs, such as the use \nof biofuels, which presents a trade-off between reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and reducing air pollution. \nThe framework illustrates how policy actions can target \ndifferent intervention points in the system. Interventions \nmay generate 'knock-on' effects for other environmental \ndimensions, highlighting the trade-offs and synergies \ninherent in policy decisions.\n\nThe analytical approach taken by this report is to focus \nprimarily on the effect and exposure dimensions of the \neDPSEEA model and consider the influence of social \ncontext. State, pressures and drivers are addressed only \nsuperficially. Extensive information on state, pressures \nand drivers is provided in various EEA reports on specific \ndimensions of environmental quality as well as in the EEA \nreport The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 \n(EEA, 2019a). The current report complements this 2019 \nEEA report with a more detailed review of the evidence of \nhow environmental quality affects health and well-being, \nboth positively and negatively.\n\nEvidence of how the environment influences health \nis presented from multiple scales. In the case of \nenvironmental benefits for health and well-being, the \nreport presents quantitative evidence of access to \nhigh-quality environments, with a focus on urban areas, \nand considers qualitative evidence of the direct benefits \nfor health and well-being from epidemiological studies. \nRegarding environmental risks, it combines quantitative \nevidence of exposure to and the health impacts of \nenvironmental stressors at the European level. This is \ncomplemented by qualitative evidence from smaller \nscale studies, with a focus on the urban environment \nin which people and multiple environmental risks are \nconcentrated. Pertinent studies of the links between \nthe environment, health and well-being at national \nand local levels, as well as policies and measures to \n\n \nBox 1.1 Applying the DPSEEA model\n\nThe drivers, pressures, state, exposure, effect, actions (DPSEEA) model and variations of the model are widely applied \nin assessing links between the environment and health. The Scottish Government introduced a policy initiative on the \nenvironment and human health \u2014 good places better health \u2014 which used a modified DPSEEA model. The model offered a \npolicy-relevant way of capturing cultural, economic and demographic drivers that shape the environment, as well as social \nand demographic factors that influence exposure and health outcomes (positive or negative) for the individual.\n\nThe modified DPSEEA model also proved to be a useful 'tool to think with', and during the process of populating the model, \nit facilitated stakeholder engagement and consensus building. The populated models, in turn, informed structured literature \nreviews and the assembly of a wider range of evidence and acted as a framework for data gathering and as a basis for \nquantification. The overall approach allowed health-relevant messages to be distilled for a broad policy constituency.\n\nSource:   Reis et al. (2015).\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n21Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\npromote good environmental health, are highlighted \nthroughout the report.\n\nThe eDPSEEA model builds on work that was done \nunder the millennium ecosystem assessment to map \nthe ecosystem services provided by natural capital \nand identify their contribution to the key constituents \nof human well-being (Millennium Assessment Board, \n2005). Nature delivers a broad range of ecosystem \nservices that support human life, providing food \nand water, regulating our climate to support life and \nproviding a basis for the cultural and aesthetic fabric \nof\u00a0society. The different ecosystem services that \nsupport the various constituents of human well-being \nare shown in Figure 1.3.\n\nThis report does not comprehensively review how the full \nrange of ecosystem services delivers benefits for health \nand well-being. Rather, it reflects on how environmental \nquality affects the delivery of certain services, leading \nto direct effects on human health and well-being. The \nservices touched on in this report include:\n\n\u2022 the provision of clean air, drinking water and food;\n\n\u2022 the cultural and recreational value of access to \nhigh-quality nature;\n\n\u2022 the regulation of the climate on multiple scales.\n\nRegarding the geographical scope covered by this report, \nwhen presenting data, we refer to three different \ngroups of countries. These include the EU-28, the 33 \nmember countries of the EEA (EEA-33) and the EEA-33 \nplus six additional cooperating countries of the EEA \n(EEA-39).\n\nThe information presented in this report relates to \nthe time period prior to the withdrawal of the United \nKingdom from the EU and as such we refer to the \nEU-28 and include data for the United Kingdom in the \nanalysis.

It \nthen goes on to consider health across Europe by \nusing key indicators. It presents evidence of how \nsocio-economic, behavioural and environmental \nfactors affect health. The aim is to provide the overall \ncontext before providing a more detailed examination \nof how\u00a0environmental conditions influence health in \nChapter 4.\n\nEnvironmental stressors are responsible for 13\u00a0% of \nall deaths in the EU, with 630\u00a0000 deaths attributed to \nthe environment annually; this is based on the most \nrecent World Health Organization (WHO) data available \non the environmental burden of disease for 2012 \n(WHO, 2016a). These deaths could be prevented by \neliminating pollution and environmental degradation. \nEastern European countries carry a significantly higher \n\nenvironmental burden of disease and mortality than \nwestern European countries, exacerbating economic \ninequalities across the European region. \n\nAccording to World Health Organization data, the \nEuropean Region is the region in the world that is \nmost affected by non-communicable diseases, with a \nrelatively small group of health conditions responsible \nfor a large part of the disease burden. The major \nnon-communicable diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular \ndiseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and \nmental disorders) together account for an estimated \n86\u00a0% of the deaths and 77\u00a0% of the disease burden in \nthe European Region. These diseases are associated \nwith a cluster of common risk factors, including \nenvironmental factors, unhealthy diets, physical \ninactivity, hypertension, obesity and tobacco and \nalcohol use (WHO, 2017a). \n\n2 Health across Europe\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Overall, 13\u00a0% of deaths in the EU are attributable to environmental stressors, a total of 630\u00a0000 deaths per year; this \nis based on the most recent World Health Organization environmental burden of disease data for 2012. These deaths \ncould be prevented by eliminating environmental risks to health and reversing environmental degradation.\n\n\u2022 In Europe, 90\u00a0% of deaths attributable to the environment result from non-communicable diseases, including cancers, \ncardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental, behavioural and neurological \ndisorders, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma.\n\n\u2022 There is a significant discrepancy between the east of Europe and the west of Europe. The highest proportion of \ndeaths attributable to the environment is seen in Bosnia and Herzegovina (27\u00a0%) and the lowest is seen in Norway and \nIceland (9\u00a0%). In the EU, the highest environmental contribution to mortality is seen in Romania (19\u00a0%) and the lowest in \nSweden and Denmark (10\u00a0%).\n\n\u2022 There are substantial health inequalities, both within and between European countries. Environmental inequalities \ncontribute to driving health inequities in Europe.\n\n\u2022 Poorer people live shorter lives with fewer healthy life-years, have poorer self-perceived health and have a higher \nprevalence of long-term health problems.\n\n\u2022 Key demographic factors influencing the health of the European population include the ageing population, migration \nand a high level of urbanisation.\n\n\u2022 Socio-economic status is linked to certain unhealthy behaviours, with lower socio-economic groups more likely to have \npoorer diets, be overweight, exercise less and smoke. These behaviours have an impact on health and make people \nmore sensitive to environmental risk factors.\n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n24 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nMajor health inequities persist across Europe, with \npoverty associated with higher levels of disease and \ndisability and shorter life expectancy. A 2013 report \nfrom the European Commission identifies the main \ncauses and impacts of these health disparities, \nincluding living conditions; health-related behaviour; \neducation, occupation and income; and healthcare, \ndisease prevention and health-promotion services \n(EC,\u00a02013c). The report acknowledges the role that \nexposure to air pollution can play in health inequities. \nIn June 2018, the EU launched the Joint Action \nHealth Equity Europe (JAHEE) project to tackle health \ninequalities, with the aim of achieving greater equity \nin health outcomes across all groups in society and \nreducing the inter-country heterogeneity in health \ninequalities (JAHEE, 2019).\n\nAchieving the United Nation's (UN's) Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) in Europe by 2030 will also \nrequire actions that address health inequities within \nand between European countries. Addressing these \ninequities will yield benefits for human well-being and \neconomic prosperity, for example a 50\u00a0% reduction \nin inequities in life expectancy between social groups \nwill provide monetised benefits to countries ranging \nfrom 0.3\u00a0% to 4.3\u00a0% of gross domestic product (GDP) \n(WHO\u00a0Europe, 2019b).\n\nReversing health inequity is a key strategic objective \nof WHO Europe's European health policy \u2014 \nHealth\u00a02020 \u2014 which addresses the broader WHO \nEuropean region (WHO Europe, 2013a). A lack of green \nspace, poor air quality, fuel deprivation and housing \ndeprivation are among the dimensions of living \nconditions that are driving health inequities in the \nEuropean region (WHO Europe, 2019b). A recent report \nexploring environmental health inequalities in the \nWHO European region found an uneven distribution of \nexposure to environmental risks, with social deprivation \nassociated with higher exposure. Environmental health \ninequities have tended to increase over time, despite \nan overall improvement in environmental conditions \n(WHO Europe, 2019a).\n\nThis chapter of the report presents evidence of the \ncontribution that environmental stressors make to \nthe environmental burden of disease and mortality \nin Europe. It introduces key indicators used to \ndescribe population health across Europe, including \nlife expectancy, healthy life-years and the prevalence \n\nof long-standing health problems. The roles of \ndemographic and socio-economic factors as health \ndeterminants are considered, together with the \ninfluence of socio-economic factors on the prevalence \nof healthy and unhealthy behaviours.\n\nWhen presenting information on population health, \nit\u00a0is\u00a0useful to consider the meaning of the term 'health' \nin a broader context. The definition of health adopted \nby the WHO in 1948 is presented in Box 2.1.\n\nMore recently, commentators have proposed \nthat health be defined as 'the ability to adapt and \nself-manage in the face of social, physical and \nemotional challenges' (Huber et al., 2011). This \nbroader concept recognises that we cannot be healthy \nin an unhealthy society and that health not only \nencompasses physical, psychological and social aspects \nbut is intrinsically linked to external factors, such as \nthe health of our planetary biodiversity (The Lancet, \n2009). A\u00a0concept of health that includes the capacity to \nadapt to changing external circumstances recognises \nchanging environmental conditions, such as climate \nchange, as\u00a0a\u00a0key driver of health and well-being.\n\n2.1 The environmental burden of disease \nin Europe\n\nEnvironmental factors contribute significantly to the \nburden of death and disease in Europe and, therefore, \nimproving environmental conditions will improve the \nhealth and well-being of European citizens. These \npotential benefits need to be taken into consideration \nduring the development of future health, environment \nand social policies. To develop these policies, it is \nnecessary to understand the significance of different \nenvironmental risk factors so that they can be targeted \nfor interventions. Definitions of the different measures \nof the burden of disease are provided in Box 2.2.\n\nIn 2012, 13\u00a0% of deaths in the 28 EU Member States \n(EU-28) were attributable to the environment. These \ndeaths could be avoided by eliminating environmental \nrisks to health. The respective figures for the \n33 member countries of the EEA (EEA-33) and the \nEEA-33 plus the six collaborating countries Albania, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo (under UN Security \nCouncil Resolution\u00a01244/99), Montenegro, North \nMacedonia and Serbia (EEA-39) are 13\u00a0% and 14\u00a0%. \n\n \nBox\t2.1\t WHO\tdefinition\tof\thealth\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not \nmerely the absence of disease or infirmity' (WHO, 1948).\n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n25Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nMap 2.1 presents deaths attributable to the \nenvironment, by country, for the EEA-39 excluding \nLiechtenstein and Kosovo. There is a clear discrepancy \nbetween countries in the east of Europe and in the \nwest of Europe, with the highest fraction of national \ndeaths (27\u00a0%) attributable to the environment in \nBosnia and Herzegovina and the lowest in Iceland and \nNorway (9\u00a0%). In terms of EU countries, the highest \nenvironmental contribution to mortality is seen in \nRomania (19\u00a0%), while the lowest is seen in Denmark \nand Sweden (10\u00a0%) (WHO, 2016a).\n\nIn terms of the absolute number of deaths attributable \nto the environment, in the EU-28, 630\u00a0000 deaths were \nattributed to the environment in 2012. The figures for \nthe EEA-33 and the EEA-39 are 716\u00a0000 deaths and \n755\u00a0000 deaths, respectively (WHO, 2016a).\n\nLooking at individual countries, the same differences \nbetween eastern Europe and western Europe can \nbe seen. Figure 2.1 presents the number of deaths \nattributable to the environment per 100\u00a0000 of the \npopulation in the EEA-39 for the year 2012, adjusted \nfor differences in the age distribution of the various \npopulations. Such deaths could be prevented by \neliminating environmental risks to health. The numbers \nvary significantly, from a high of 172 per 100\u00a0000 in \nAlbania to a low of 35 per 100\u00a0000 in Iceland. In terms \nof EU countries, Romania has the highest number of \ndeaths per 100\u00a0000 attributable to the environment, \nwhile Sweden has the lowest number. The higher \nburden of deaths from environmental conditions in \nthe east of Europe is clearly visible, with the more \nrecent members of the EU consistently showing higher \nnumbers of deaths per 100\u00a0000, with the exception \n\nof Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia. All EU countries \nwith a burden of preventable deaths attributable to \nthe environment greater than 15\u00a0% have joined the \nEU since 2004, with the sole exception of Greece.\n\nData on deaths attributable to the environment are \ntaken from the WHO's Global Health Observatory \ndata repository, based on the study 'Preventing \ndisease through healthy environments' (Pr\u00fcss-Ust\u00fcn \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). The aspects of the environment that drive \ndeaths included in the methodology are:\n\n\u2022 air, soil and water pollution with chemicals or \nbiological agents;\n\n\u2022 noise and electromagnetic fields;\n\n\u2022 anthropogenic climate change and ecosystem \ndegradation;\n\n\u2022 ultraviolet and ionising radiation;\n\n\u2022 the built environment;\n\n\u2022 occupational risks;\n\n\u2022 agricultural methods and irrigation schemes; \n\n\u2022 individual behaviours related to the environment, \nsuch as hand washing, food contamination with \nunsafe water and dirty hands.\n\nAs a result, the scope goes beyond the dimensions \nof environmental quality addressed in this report to \ninclude occupational risks, the built environment, \n\n \nBox 2.2 Definitions of different measures of the burden of disease\n\nThe burden of disease is a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone \nlives into old age, free from disease and disability. The disease burden tends to be expressed in disability-adjusted life-years \n(DALYs).\n\nAdditional deaths/excess mortality: this refers to additional deaths that are related to a specific disease. Essentially, it is \nthe extra number of deaths due to a specific condition.\n\nPremature deaths are deaths that occur before a person reaches an expected age. This expected age is typically the life \nexpectancy for a country, stratified by sex. Premature deaths are considered preventable if their cause can be eliminated.\n\nA DALY is 1 lost year of a 'healthy' life, on account of a disease, injury or risk factor. The burden of disease is the sum of \nthese DALYs across the population. Therefore, DALYs standardise health effects by expressing, in one number, the number \nof people affected and the duration and severity of the health effects.\n\nYears of life lost (YLL) is defined as the years of potential life lost because of premature death. YLL is an estimate of the \nnumber of years that people in a population would have lived had there been no premature deaths. The YLL measure takes \ninto account the age at which deaths occur and, therefore, the contribution to the total number of lost life years is higher for \na premature death occurring at a younger age and lower for a premature death occurring at an older age.\n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n26 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nMap 2.1  Percentage of deaths attributable to the environment by country (EEA-39 excluding \nLiechtenstein and Kosovo), 2012\n\nNote:  No data are available for Liechtenstein or Kosovo.\n\nSource:  WHO (2016a).\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km0\n\n70\u00b00\u00b060\u00b0\n\n505050\n\n70\u00b0\u00b060\u00b0\n\n000\n\nDeaths (%)\n\nPercentage of deaths \nattributable to the \nenvironment by country, 2012\n\n9-11\n\n12-13\n\n14-16\n\n17-22\n\n> 22\n\nNo data\n\nOutside coverage\n\nultraviolet radiation, agricultural practice and sanitary \nbehaviours.

This is consistent across the EU\u00a028, the EEA33 and the EEA-39\u00a0(WHO, 2016b).

The number \nof healthy life-years that are lost in the EU-28 countries \nas a result of environmental pollution is estimated at \nmore than 20 million annually, rising to over 25 million \nfor the EEA-39 countries, based on WHO data for \n2012 (WHO, 2016c).\n\nIn terms of which environmental stressors drive \ndisease, Table 2.1 identifies linkages between a range \nof non-communicable diseases and environmental \nrisk factors addressed in this report (Pr\u00fcss-Ust\u00fcn \net al., 2016). It is worth noting that a number of \n\nenvironmental risk factors contribute to the same \ndiseases. For example, air pollution, noise, chemicals \nand climate change all contribute to the burden \nof cardiovascular disease, while noise, chemicals \nand climate change all drive neuropsychiatric \ndisorders. By acquiring a better understanding of the \ncontribution of environmental risk factors to disease, \nfuture environmental policies can be directed towards \ndelivering the best health outcomes for the citizens of \nEurope.\n\nTable 2.2 provides an overview of estimates of \nthe burden of death and disease associated with \nexposure to different environmental stressors. Air \npollution has the most significant impact on health, \nleading to around 400 000 premature deaths per \nyear and nearly 4 million DALYs in the EU. Noise \ncomes second, driving over 12\u00a0000 premature deaths \nper year and over 1 million DALYs in the EEA-33. \n\nNote:  The high-income countries in Europe include Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, \nGreece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, \nSan Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nSource:  WHO (2016b).\n\nFigure 2.2  Top 10 non-communicable diseases causing deaths attributable to the environment in the \nhigh income European countries, 2012 \n\n1st\nCancers\n254 600 2nd\n\nIschaemic\nheart disease\n\n134 200\n\nChronic \nobstructive \npulmonary \n\ndisease 4th\n5th\n\n6th\n\nStroke\n46 400\n\n4 200\n\n7 000\n\n28 600\n\n26 700\n\n4 300\n\n3 700\n\nMental, behavioural and \nneurological conditions, including \nAlzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson's disease\n\nDiabetes \nmelitus\n\nChronic kidney \ndiseases\n\nAsthma\n\nOther circulatory diseases and \ncardiovascular diseases\n\nHypertensive \nheart disease\n\n9th\n\n8th\n\n7th\n\n10th\n\n3rd\n80 700\n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n29Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nEstimates of the DALYs attributable to indoor air \npollution range from 300\u00a0500 to 2 million at the EU \nlevel, with the lower estimate based on emissions \nfrom solid fuels used for cooking and the higher \ncapturing a broader range of air pollutants and radon.\n\nRegarding the impacts of climate change on health, \ndata are scarcer because of the complexity of \nattributing single weather events to climate change \nand the manner in which climate stressors interact \nwith a broad range of social factors to bring about \nan impact on health. Heatwaves are the deadliest \ntype of extreme weather across Europe as a whole, \nwith 70\u00a0000 deaths attributed to the heatwave of \n2003 (Robine et al., 2008). Over the period 1980-2017, \n90\u00a0325 deaths resulted from the impacts of extreme \nweather and climate-related events in the EEA-33. In \neconomic terms, in the EU Member States, disasters \ncaused by weather and climate-related extremes \naccounted for some 83\u00a0% of monetary losses caused by \nnatural hazards over the period 1980-2017, equating to \nEUR\u00a0426 billion (at 2017 values) (EEA, 2019b).\n\nFor chemicals, data are not available because of \nthe sheer complexity of establishing causality \nfor the large number of chemical pollutants and \nattributing disease fractions. The World Health \nOrganization attributes 2.7 % of all global deaths in \n2016 to exposure to a relatively limited number of \nchemicals\u00a0(WHO, 2018c).\n\nThis burden of death and disease could be avoided by \neliminating environmental pollution and degradation. \nIt signals an urgent need to improve environmental \nconditions, particularly in the east of Europe, to reduce \nthe burden of disease and mortality and improve \nquality of life.\n\n2.2 Health indicators for Europe\n\nHealth is multifaceted, and no single indicator is able to \nfully describe the health status of a population or the \ninfluence that health has on an individual's quality of \nlife. As a result, multiple health indicators are relied on \n\nNotes:  The population attributable fractions are presented as follows: p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a05-25 %. These are based on global estimates, rather \nthan Europe-specific data. Chemical risk factors are limited to industrial and agricultural chemicals, including those involved in acute \npoisoning.

This is \nbased on the perception that individuals have of their \nown health. While variations between and within EU \nMember States might reflect objective differences in \nactual health, they may also reflect differences between \npopulation attitudes or individual attitudes towards \nhealth. In 2017, the number of healthy life years at birth \nwas estimated at 64 years for women and 63.5 years \nfor men in the EU-28; this represented approximately \n77\u00a0% and 81\u00a0% of the total life expectancy for women \nand men (Eurostat, 2020a).\n\nIt is of note that the trend of a steady increase in \nlife expectancy in the EU from 2001 to 2011 slowed \nconsiderably in many Member States in the years up \nuntil 2016 because of a slower rate in the reduction of \ncardiovascular disease and an increase in the number \nof deaths among the elderly during the winter months \n(OECD and EU, 2018). \n\n2.3 Changing demographics in Europe\n\nDemographic changes in Europe pose key economic \nand social challenges. These challenges are linked to \nthe healthcare burden but also have implications for \nenvironmental health. Three key demographic factors \ninfluence the health of the European population: the \nageing population, migration and a high proportion \nof the European population living in urban areas. \nThis section presents a brief overview of these three \ndemographic factors, briefly reflecting on the links to \nthe environment and health.\n\n2.3.1 The ageing population\n\nThe EU-28 is home to 511.8 million inhabitants. \nAlthough the population of some Member States is \ndeclining and the overall rate of population growth has \nslowed in recent decades, the population of the EU-28 \nas a whole continues to grow and is expected to peak \nat around 529 million people by 2045 (Eurostat, 2017a).\n\nIn 2018, 19.7\u00a0% of the EU population was over 65 years \nold (Eurostat, 2019c). More than half of EU citizens aged \n65 to 74 report a long-standing illness or health problem. \nAside from Japan, the EU has the world's most rapidly \nageing population (Eurostat, 2017a). This has been \n\nSources:  Eurostat (2019b, 2020a, 2020b).\n\nFigure 2.3  Summary of key indicators of health across Europe \n\nLife expectancy\nat birth in 2017\n\nFemale: 84 years\nMale: 78 years\n\nOverall trend:\n\nHealthy life years\n in 2017\n\nFemale: 64 years\nMale: 63.5 years\n\nOverall trend:\n\nSelf-perceived health\nin 2018\n\n68 %\nof the EU population\n\nrated their health\nas very good or good\n\nLong-standing health\nproblems 2018\n\n36 %\nof the population\n\nreported a long-standing\nillness or health problem\n\n \nLinks between aging and environmental health\n\nOlder people are more susceptible to the effects of environmental stressors such as pollution, climate change impacts, for \nexample heatwaves, and water pollution. They are also less resilient, with a lower capacity to recover from negative health \nimpacts, restore damage to their homes and avoid future risks. As the population ages, a higher proportion will be at risk \nof being negatively affected by environmental pollution and climate change. Access to green space in urban areas can \nreduce the social isolation of older people. The accessibility of green and blue spaces needs to be considered as the ageing \npopulation becomes less mobile. \n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n32 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nSource:  EEA (2016a).\n\nFigure 2.4  Historical and projected share of people over 65 in Europe and worldwide\n\nEU-28, historical data EU-28, high fertilityEU-28, medium fertilityEU-28, low fertility\n\nWorld, historical data World, medium fertility\n\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 2100\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nPercentage\n\ndescribed as a 'demographic time-bomb' (EC,\u00a02005), \nas\u00a0demands for social welfare and healthcare provisions \nare increasing while the share of the population that \nis of working age is declining. Figure\u00a02.4 presents the \nhistorical and projected share of people aged 65 and \nover in the EU-28 and worldwide, showing how low \nfertility rates may lead to as much as 40 % of the EU \npopulation being over 65 by the year 2100. \n\n2.3.2 Urbanisation\n\nOngoing urbanisation \u2014 referring to the growth in the \nnumber of people who live in urban areas \u2014 is another \nkey trend in Europe (EuroHealthNet, 2017). The\u00a0level \nof urbanisation in Europe is expected to increase \nfrom 74\u00a0% at present to about 75\u00a0% in 2020 and \n83.7\u00a0% in 2050 (UN DESA, 2018). This requires effective \nurban planning, to limit the potential adverse health \n\nimplications and inequalities that can result from \nurban\u00a0living (WHO Europe, 2017b).\n\nHazards for urban populations include increased \nexposure to air pollution, noise levels, waste and \nthe heat island effect during high temperatures, as \nwell as\u00a0increased sedentary behaviour and isolation. \nThese factors contribute to the growing epidemic of \nnon-communicable diseases and mental health issues \n(Carmichael et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition, people living in EU cities are more likely \nto suffer from chronic depression. For example, \nin 2014 7.8\u00a0% of people living in cities in the \nEU-28 reported suffering from depression, compared \nwith 6.2\u00a0% in rural areas. However, this pattern was not \nthe same in all parts of Europe, with countries such as \nCroatia, Hungary, Spain and Sweden reporting higher \nlevels of depression in rural areas (Eurostat, 2018a). \n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n33Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nThe provision of well-designed urban environments \nalso provides the potential to create positive health \nand well-being opportunities, while the proximity of \npeople, businesses and services also allows for the \ndevelopment of a more resource-efficient Europe. \nWell-designed cities and urban areas can also, for \nexample, provide shorter journeys to work, more \nopportunities to walk, cycle and use public transport, \nand more access to urban green and blue spaces. \n\n2.3.3 Migration\n\nImmigration is the primary driver of population growth \nin Europe. From 2012 to 2016, positive net migration \ninto Europe accounted for 80\u00a0% of population growth, \nand this trend is set to continue (Eurostat, 2017a). \nImmigration not only occurs between Member States \nbut also stems from non-EU countries. In 2016, the \nnumber of non-EU citizens entering the EU was \n1.3 million, and the non-EU population reached almost \n22\u00a0million. These population flows have the potential to \ncreate additional strains on healthcare systems, which \nin some cases must cater for rapid localised population \ngrowth. However, the younger age profile of the migrant \npopulation counters the effect of the ageing population.\n\n2.4 The influence of socio-economic \nfactors on health\n\nThe relationship between socio-economic status and \nhealth inequality is unequivocal (Pickett and Wilkinson, \n2015). Societies with wide disparities in socio-economic \nstatus also have wide disparities in health outcomes. \n\nThese disparities are influenced by differences in social \nprotection, education, income, access to healthcare, \ndisease prevention and living conditions (EC, 2013c).\n\nThere are also relationships between health risk \nfactors, such as tobacco use, and socio-economic \ncircumstances (EC, 2013c). Within the EU, populations \nwith higher levels of education and wealth generally \nperceive their own health status as good and show \nimproved life expectancy. However, populations that \nare less educated and poorer perceive their own health \nstatus as bad and have a lower life expectancy. Across \nthe EU, people with a low level of education can expect \nto live 6 years less than those with a high level of \neducation (OECD and EC, 2018).\n\nA study of 16 European cities found evidence of \na consistent pattern of inequality in mortality, with \nmortality increasing in parallel with socio-economic \ndeprivation (Borrell et al., 2014). Nearly half of \nexcess mortality in the lower socio-economic \ngroups is explained by inequalities in cardiovascular \ndiseases (Dahlgren and Whitehead, 2006), for which \nenvironmental conditions, such as air pollution and \nopportunities for physical activity, are key risk factors \n(WHO Europe, 2017b). Recent reviews at European level \nhave demonstrated a consistent link between social \ndeprivation and exposure to environments of poorer \nquality across Europe (EEA, 2018a; WHO Europe, 2019a). \nThe relationship between exposure and vulnerability to \nenvironmental stressors and socio-economic status is \nexamined for specific stressors in Chapter 4.\n\nThe sections below briefly examine the influence of \nvarious socio-economic factors on health.\n\n \nLinks between urbanisation and environmental health\n\nUrban environments see a concentration of stressors such as air pollution, noise, heat and chemical exposure. An increasing \nproportion of the future population will be at risk of being negatively affected by these environmental stressors unless \nappropriate urban design and planning principles are applied and efforts are made to address sources of pollution, such as \nunsustainable transport. \n\n \nLinks between migration and environmental health\n\nMigrants from outside the EU, and even their children who are born within the EU, are at a greater risk of being \nsocio-economically disadvantaged (OECD, 2017) and thus potentially live in areas with, for example, higher levels of traffic, \nsub-standard housing and poor access to green spaces. They are therefore more likely to be exposed to environmental \nstressors, such as poor indoor air quality, heat and cold stress, noise and air pollution. Urban green spaces provide an \narena for immigrant communities to interact with other people from the local community, promoting integration and social \ncohesion. \n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n34 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n2.4.1 The relationship between socio-economic status \nand life expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth in 2017 ranged from \n74.8 years in Bulgaria to 83.1 years in Italy \u2014 a \ndifference of 8.3 years. The economic status of \nan individual Member State has an effect on life \nexpectancy, as shown in Figure 2.5, which shows the \nrelationship between life expectancy at birth and \n\nGDP per capita. Three main European groups are \nidentifiable: the Baltic and eastern European Member \nStates, which exhibit a relatively low life expectancy \nat birth and low levels of GDP; Mediterranean \nMember States, which generally have a relatively \nhigh life expectancy and medium GDP per capita; \nand western European and Nordic Member States, \nwhere life expectancy is generally similar to that in \nMediterranean Member States, but GDP is higher.\n\nNote:  GDP per capita is expressed in units of purchasing power standard (PPS) \u2014 this is a notional common currency that eliminates the \ndifferences in price levels, allowing meaningful volume comparisons of GDP between countries. Data for North Macedonia and the \nUnited Kingdom are for 2016.\n\nSource:  Eurostat (2019b).\n\nEU-28\n\nBelgium\n\nBulgaria\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\nGermany\n\nEstonia\n\nIreland \n\nGreece \n\nSpain \n\nFrance \n\nCroatia\n\nItaly\n\nCyprus\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nHungary\n\nMalta Netherlands \n\nAustria\n\nPoland \n\nPortugal\n\nRomania \n\nSlovenia\n\nSlovakia\n\nFinland\n\nSweden\n\nUnited\nKingdom\n\nIceland Norway\n\nSwitzerland \n\nNorth\nMacedonia\n\nAlbania\n\nSerbia\n\n0\n\n 72\n\n 74\n\n 76\n\n 78\n\n 80\n\n 82\n\n 84\n\n 86\n\n0 10 000 20 000 30 000 40 000 50 000 60 000 70 000 80 000\n\nGDP per capita at market prices (PPS)\n\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\n\nFigure 2.5  Life expectancy at birth and GDP per capita, 2017\n\f\nHealth across Europe\n\n35Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n2.4.2 The relationship between socio-economic status \nand the risk of having a long-standing health \nproblem or disease\n\nA long-standing health problem or disease is a health \nproblem that has lasted, or is likely to last, at least \n6 months. Over one third of the EU-28 population \nreported that they suffered from a chronic condition in \n2018. As Figure 2.6 indicates, inequalities exist in health, \nbased on income. Overall in the EU, 31\u00a0% of\u00a0people in \ncountries in the top income quintile\u00a0(i.e.\u00a0the\u00a0wealthiest) \nreported having a long-standing illness or health \nproblem, compared with 44\u00a0% in the bottom quintile \n(i.e. the poorest) (Eurostat, 2020b). \n\n2.4.3 The relationship between socio-economic status \nand self-perceived health\n\nIn terms of self-perceived health, 68\u00a0% of people aged \n16 and over in the EU declared themselves to be in \n'good' or 'very good' health in 2018 (see Figure 2.7). In \nall EU Member States the share of men perceiving their \nhealth as good or very good is higher than the share of \nwomen. The share of both men and women perceiving \ntheir health as good or very good increases with level of \neducation and with income. In the top income quintile \nof the population (i.e. the wealthiest) 79\u00a0% rated their \nhealth as very good or good, while in the bottom \nquintile (i.e. the poorest) 59 % rated their health as very \ngood or good (Eurostat, 2020b). \n\nAs would be expected, self-perceived health tends to \ndeteriorate with age. In 2018, fewer people rated their \nhealth as being very good or good in higher age groups \nthan in lower age groups, while the share reporting bad \nor very bad health increased with age.\n\nThe VulnerABLE project supported efforts to improve \nthe health of the most vulnerable social groups and is \ndescribed in Box 2.3. \n\n2.5 Healthy and unhealthy behaviours\n\nThe prevalence of health-related behaviours, such as \nthose related to diet, physical activity and smoking, \nare useful indicators of a population's health because \nof their association with non-communicable chronic \ndiseases (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Targeting these \nbehaviours can improve the health of a population. \nThe brief analysis of a number of factors presented \nin Figure 2.8 highlights their significant influence \non health in Europe and also indicates that they are \ninfluenced by socio-economic status. For example, \nFigure 2.9 indicates how the percentage of the \npopulation that spent time on health-enhancing \nphysical activity varies by level of education, with a \nlower proportion of less educated groups engaging in \nexercise that benefits health. Research is now focused \non the linkages between behaviour, health and \nenvironmental sustainability, with examples provided \nin Box\u00a02.4.\n\nNote:  Ranked on the share of the total population suffering from a long-standing illness or health problem.

The project includes a database of \ngood practice case studies from around Europe, on the topics of 'living' (green space, housing), 'moving' (active transport) \nand 'consuming' (food). The database is publicly accessible at: https://www.inherit.eu/db-results.\n\nPASTA \u2014 this EU-funded project reviewed how urban planners can create urban environments that encourage \nhealthy behaviour and physical activity (PASTA, 2019).

Improving access to high-quality \ngreen and blue spaces offers opportunities to improve \nhealth outcomes for urban populations.\n\nThe benefits for health and well-being depend on \nan individual's interaction with the space, which is \n\ninfluenced by both the characteristics of the space, \nsuch as access, quality and safety, and personal \nchoices and capacities. The accessibility of green and \nblue spaces to different social groups determines how \nbenefits are distributed across society. The presence \nof green space in a local neighbourhood is especially \nimportant for socially deprived populations, children \nand the elderly.\n\n3 The benefits of nature for health and \nwell-being\n\n \nBox 3.1 Defining green and blue spaces\n\nGreen space: an area of vegetated land within the urban fabric, predominantly designed for recreational use. These can be \nnatural areas of different scales, from green roofs or pocket gardens to large urban parks.\n\nBlue space: spaces with water as the main focus, either marine water or freshwater.\n\nGreen infrastructure: a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas designed and managed to deliver \necosystem services. In urban areas, features may include parks, gardens, grassy verges, green walls and green roofs, as well \nas aquatic elements, as long as they are part of an interconnected network.\n\nThe photo below shows an example of a public blue space in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nPhoto: \u00a9 EEA.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n40 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nGreen and blue spaces can mitigate environmental \nstressors in the immediate term, for example by \nalleviating air pollution, providing cool spaces during \nperiods of heat and reducing noise, as well as \nincreasing ecosystem resilience and enhancing carbon \nstorage over the longer term. This is particularly \nrelevant for green spaces in urban areas.\n\nDefinitions of green and blue spaces, as well as the \nbroader concept of green infrastructure, are provided \nin Box 3.1, while various types of green infrastructure in \nurban areas are shown in Figure 3.1. \n\nRecognition of the potential benefits of urban green \nand blue spaces is driving an increasing interest \nin nature-based solutions as a means of ensuring \nthe delivery of ecosystem services and reversing \nbiodiversity loss.

It calls for the development of ambitious Urban \nGreening Plans for European cities by the end of 2021, including measures to create biodiverse and accessible urban forests, \nparks and gardens; urban farms; green roofs and walls; treelined streets; urban meadows; and urban hedges. \n\nThese strategy areas are supported by EU guidance for the deployment of EU-level green and blue infrastructure through \npolicy, planning and business investment decisions (EC, 2019b). Complementary guidance defines criteria for green and blue \ninfrastructure, and identifies available technical and financial support instruments that can help planners integrate natural \nlandscape features into strategic 'green and blue infrastructure' (EC, 2019c).\n\nA number of other EU initiatives promote access to green spaces in urban areas:\n\n\u2022 Priority objective 8 of the Seventh Environment Action Programme is entitled 'Sustainable cities, working together \nfor common solutions' (EU, 2013a).\n\n\u2022 The urban agenda for the EU promotes cooperation between Member States, cities, the European Commission and \nother stakeholders to stimulate growth, liveability and innovation in the cities of Europe and to identify and successfully \ntackle social challenges (EC, 2019d).\n\n\u2022 The reference framework for sustainable cities is an online toolkit for local European authorities that are involved \nin\u00a0or are willing to start a process of integrated and sustainable urban development (Urbact, 2018).\n\n\u2022 The European Green Capital Award rewards cities that are making an effort to improve the urban environment and \nmove towards healthier and sustainable living areas (EC, 2019e).\n\n\u2022 The European Green Leaf competition is open to cities with a population of between 20\u00a0000 and 100\u00a0000. It recognises \nsuccess in achieving green growth and is awarded to cities that bring green living concepts to life (EC, 2019f).\n\n\u2022 The EnRoute project explored how urban green infrastructure contributed to sustainability and mitigated \nenvironmental risks in 18 cities from across Europe (JRC, 2019).\n\nIn addition, the aim of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal\u00a011.7 is to provide universal access to safe, inclusive \nand accessible green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities, \nby\u00a02030.\n\nacross Europe and on a finer scale within cities. As \na result, the scope is narrow and does not capture \nthe full range of ecosystem services provided by \nnature. Box 3.3 summarises some of the broader \ninterlinkages between biodiversity and health, \nhighlighting how diverse ecosystems benefit health \n\nand how biodiversity loss impacts on health. \nAs a recent example, the transfer of the SARS- \nCoV-2 virus from wild mammals to humans that \ncaused the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to have \nresulted from novel human-animal interactions in \nthe food\u00a0system.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n42 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 3.3 Interlinkages between biodiversity and health\n\nThe benefits of biodiversity for health\n\n\u2022 Biodiversity in the form of pollinators, soil biota and natural pest controllers plays a critical role in supporting food \nproduction. A broad diversity of species, varieties and breeds underpins good nutrition and varied diets.\n\n\u2022 Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems underpin the water cycle and the provision of clean water supplies, regulating \nnutrient cycling, soil erosion and water purification.\n\n\u2022 Many medicines are derived from naturally occurring products, such as antibiotics. A large proportion of antibacterial \ndrugs can be traced back to products of natural origin. Plant, microbial and marine species hold vast potential for new \nmedicinal products.\n\n\u2022 The human body depends on microbiota to support functions such as the function of the gastrointestinal tract, the \nregulation of the immune system and the prevention of infections. Reduced contact with healthy ecosystems can \nreduce diversity in this human microbiota and lead to immune dysfunction and diseases, such as allergies and bowel \ndiseases.\n\n\u2022 Spending time in natural environments is also associated with improved mental health and increased levels of physical \nactivity with consequent health benefits. The benefits of access to biodiverse green spaces are particularly high for \nurban residents of low socio-economic status. Interaction with nature can contribute to treatment for depression, \nanxiety and behaviour problems, including for children. \n\n\u2022 Biodiversity contributes to ecosystem resilience and is essential for enabling the adaptation of our agricultural \nproduction systems to climate change. For example, new species may be drawn into agricultural production as the \nclimate shifts. Vegetation reduces erosion and plays a role in flood mitigation, reducing the impact of natural disasters \non health and well-being.\n\n\u2022 Living organisms act as bio-indicators of human health stressors. For example, lichen act as indicators of air pollution, \nwhile crustaceans are an indicator species for water quality. \n\nDirect effects of biodiversity loss on health\n\n\u2022 Biodiversity loss can destabilise pathogen dynamics, in particular pest control, leading to increases in the population \nsize and ranges of disease vectors, as well as spillovers across species, increasing the risk of infectious disease. Invasive \nspecies can carry disease, promote infections and expose humans to bites or stings.\n\n\u2022 Eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient loading as a result of agriculture has a significant impact on surface water \nquality and can limit the availability of water supplies for drinking water.\n\n\u2022 Biodiversity loss can lead to natural pest control species being removed from agricultural systems and can necessitate \nthe use of chemical pesticides. This increases the potential for human health impacts to occur from exposure to \nhazardous chemicals as well as further impacts on non-target species. \n\n\u2022 Land clearance can lead to erosion and the destabilisation of slopes, which can result in landslides or avalanches in \nextreme weather conditions, affecting local water bodies and leading to injury and death. \n\nSources:   Based on WHO and SCBD (2015).\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n43Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nSpending time in high-quality natural environments \nimproves our health and well-being. In terms of \nspecific health outcomes, exposure to natural \nenvironments is associated with improved \nmental health and cognitive function, reduced \ncardiovascular morbidity, reduced prevalence \nof type 2 diabetes, reduced adverse pregnancy \noutcomes and reduced all-cause and cardiovascular \ndisease mortality (WHO, 2016d). The pathways \nthrough which natural environments deliver \nbenefits for health are physical exercise, relaxation \nand restoration, social cohesion and support \nof the immune system (see Figure 3.2). The \nrelationship between levels of green space in a local \nneighbourhood and people's health and well-being \nis especially significant for low-income and deprived \nurban and suburban populations (Ward Thompson \net al., 2016).\n\nNonetheless, those involved in the planning of \ngreen and blue spaces and green infrastructure \nshould also be aware of the potential of these \nspaces to introduce health hazards. These can \ninclude allergens, such as pollen, disease vectors, \nsuch as ticks and mosquitoes, and physical injuries. \nHowever, these can be effectively\u00a0managed through \nthe appropriate design, maintenance and operation \nof green spaces (L\u00f5hmus and Balbus, 2015).\n\n3.1.1 Benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\nHigh-quality natural environments, in particular \ngreen spaces, directly support health and \nwell-being. Overall, the evidence base for the \nspecific benefits of blue space is more limited. The \nevidence base is reviewed below with regard to the \nkey benefits identified.\n\nReduced mortality and morbidity\n\nA number of reviews have found positive associations \nbetween local access to nature and reduced mortality \n(Mitchell and Popham, 2008; Maas et al., 2009a), in \nparticular for cardiovascular disease and respiratory \ndisease (Richardson and Mitchell, 2010; Gascon et al., \n2016). While less cardiovascular illness and lower blood \npressure are likely to result from exercising in green \nareas, mere contact with nature has also been found to \nhave a positive impact on heart rate and blood pressure \n(Pretty et al., 2011).\n\nWith respect to type 2 diabetes, a study from England \nfound a lower prevalence among people living near \na\u00a0large area of green space (Bodicoat et al., 2014). Other \nstudies found associations between neighbourhood \ngreenness and reduced chances of having type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus (Maas et al., 2009a; Astell-Burt \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02014).\n\nImproved mental health\n\nThere is strong evidence of the mental health benefits \nof green space, related to avoiding chronic stress and \nattentional fatigue (WHO, 2016d). Spending time in \nnature reduces anxiety, depression and loneliness, \nwhile a lack of green space is associated with increased \nsymptoms (Maas et al., 2009a). Simply viewing nature \nenhances emotional well-being (Morris, 2003).\n\nA recent meta-analysis found a range of positive \nphysiological responses associated with viewing or being \nin a natural environment, including significant reductions \nin diastolic blood pressure, salivary cortisol and heart rate \n(Twohig-Bennett and Jones, 2018). The stress-reducing \neffects of gardening have been evidenced through lower \ncortisol levels (Van den Berg and Custer, 2011).\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Exposure to green space benefits health by reducing mortality and morbidity from chronic diseases, improving mental \nhealth and pregnancy outcomes, and reducing obesity.\n\n\u2022 Socially deprived communities stand to benefit the most from the health benefits of natural environments, through \nreductions in stress, mortality and morbidity.\n\n\u2022 Access to green space promotes community cohesion, reducing social isolation for minority groups and the elderly.\n\n\u2022 Exposure to green spaces in school and around the home promotes healthy physical, emotional and cognitive \ndevelopment in children, securing health benefits for their future life.\n\n\u2022 The pathways through which natural environments deliver benefits for health are physical exercise, relaxation and \nrestoration, social cohesion and support of the immune system. \n\n3.1 The health benefits of green and blue spaces\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n44 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nA study in four European cities in Lithuania, the \nNetherlands and Spain found that time spent in green \nspace delivered improved mental health and vitality \n(van den Berg et al., 2016). UK studies have linked \naccess to high-quality natural environments to reduced \npsychological distress (Pope, 2018; White et al., 2013) \nand found that people moving to greener areas showed \nan improvement in their mental health (Alcock et al., \n2014). Similarly, evidence from four large Dutch cities \nlinked the quantity of green space close to homes \nwith good self-reported health (van Dillen et al., 2012). \nA Swedish study found that spending time in forested \n\nareas supports the rehabilitation of individuals with \nstress-related mental disorders (P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2017).\n\nWhile the benefits of blue space have received less \nattention, a recent review found a positive association \nbetween exposure to blue spaces and mental health, \nwell-being and levels of physical activity (Gascon \net\u00a0al., 2017). Exposure to blue spaces has been found \nto lower psychological stress (Nutsford et al., 2016). \nA German study found that the well-being of city \ndwellers is particularly associated with blue space, \nthrough enhanced contemplation, emotional bonding, \n\nFigure 3.2  Health and well-being benefits of green and blue spaces\n\nLiving, working or being \neducated in or near \ngreen/blue spaces\n\nImproved \nmental health\n\nImproved cognitive \nfunctioning\n\nReduced cardiovascular \nmorbidity\n\nReduced prevalence \nof  type 2 diabetes\n\nReduced mortality\n\nImprove maternal \nand foetal outcomes\n\nEnhanced\nphysical\nactivity\n\nImproved\nimmune\nfunctioning\n\nImproved\nrelaxation and\n\nrestoration\n\nImproved\nsocial \ncohesion\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n45Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nparticipation and physical activity (V\u00f6lker and Kistemann, \n2011). A study of university students in Bulgaria \nfound that both blue and green spaces in the urban \nenvironment allow restoration, leading to better mental \nhealth (Dzhambov, 2018). Further research is needed to \nbetter understand the associations between blue spaces, \nhealth and well-being.\n\nImproved maternal and foetal outcomes\n\nExposure to green space during pregnancy has been \nfound to positively affect birth outcomes by increasing \nlevels of physical activity, reducing stress, enhancing \nsocial contact among mothers and reducing maternal \nexposure to noise, air pollution and high temperatures \n(Dadvand et al., 2012). There is consistent evidence \nfrom several countries that exposure to greenness \nand the presence of green spaces close to homes \nduring pregnancy is positively associated with birth \nweight (Dadvand et al., 2014a; Dzhambov et al., 2014; \nMarkevych et al., 2014; James et al., 2015). A low birth \nweight is a major predictor of neonatal and infant \nmortality, as well as long-term adverse health effects. \nIn a Lithuanian study, increased distance to a city park \nwas linked to a higher risk of pre-term birth and a lower \ngestational age at birth (Grazuleviciene et al., 2015). \nFinally, there is some evidence for fewer depressive \nsymptoms in pregnant women living near green spaces \n(McEachan, 2016).\n\nReduced obesity\n\nA review of the relationship between green spaces \nand obesity that included studies from across Europe \nfound that the majority of studies found associations \nbetween exposure to green space and reduced obesity \n(Lachowycz and Jones, 2011). However, not all studies \nhave identified such a clear relationship. Dempsey et al. \n(2018) found that, in Ireland, older adults in areas with \nboth the lowest and highest shares of green space have \na higher probability of being obese than those in areas \nwith intermediate shares of green space, suggesting \nthat other characteristics of urban areas may be \nmediating this relationship (for example elements of \naccessibility or how vulnerable/safe people feel using \nthese spaces). The factors that determine access to \nand use of green space are examined in more detail \nin\u00a0Section 3.2.\n\n3.1.2 Pathways for delivering benefits\n\nThe principal pathways through which nature \ncontributes to health and well-being are physical \nactivity, relaxation and restoration, and social cohesion. \nThere is also emerging evidence of improved immune \nfunctioning linked to exposure to nature.\n\nRelaxation and restoration\n\nThe restorative effect of contact with nature is \nexplained by the theory that humans have an innate \nneed for the natural environment in which we evolved. \nSpending time in natural environments helps people to \nrecover from psycho-physiological stress and restore \nattention and energy in the case of mental fatigue \n(WHO, 2016d).\n\nRegarding stress reduction, contact with nature has \na positive effect on those with high levels of stress, \nas it relaxes them and allows them to shift towards \na more positive emotional state (Ulrich et al., 1991). \nNatural areas also tend to be free from nuisance noise, \nwhich has also been shown to reduce stress levels and \nimprove quality of life (EC, 2015a). Exposure to natural \nstimuli triggers a parasympathetic nervous system \nresponse that leads to feelings of enhanced well-being \nand relaxation. In terms of reducing mental fatigue, \nexposure to interesting and varied natural stimuli helps \nto improve performance in cognitive tasks. In contrast \nto the direct attention required by tasks, observing \nnature stimulates indirect fascination and so restores \nmental energy (Ohly et al., 2016). The level of species \ndiversity within a green space has also been shown \nto influence the potential health benefits (Dallimer \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02012).\n\nPhysical activity\n\nParks, communal gardens and urban farms provide \nspaces for physical activity, such as jogging, gardening \nand walking, which have restorative impacts on \nhealth. There is some evidence to suggest that green \nspace availability encourages physical activity (Pretty \net\u00a0al., 2011; Kabisch et al., 2015). Studies from several \nEuropean countries have found walking, exercise and \nreduced sedentary time to be associated with access \nto green space for people of different age groups \n(WHO,\u00a02016d). In a context in which physical inactivity is \na leading risk factor for mortality, this offers a potential \npublic health solution. Regular physical activity reduces \nthe risk of ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, breast \nand colon cancers, stroke, hypertension and obesity \n(WHO, 2010).\n\nRegarding mental health, exercising in green space \nhas been found to deliver reductions in self-reported \nanger, fatigue, anxiety and sadness, with increased \nfeelings of energy (Bowler, 2010a). People exercising \nin green spaces were found to have improved moods \nand self-esteem, with the presence of water generating \ngreater effects (Barton and Pretty, 2010).\n\nThere are also various physical and psychological \nbenefits derived from undertaking physical activity \n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n46 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nin natural aquatic environments (White et al., 2010; \nAshbullby et al., 2013; White et al., 2016). As discussed \nin Section 4.5, the majority of bathing waters across \nEurope are in an excellent condition, providing \nEuropean citizens with opportunities for recreation.\n\nIn terms of how access to green space links with \nphysical activity, a Danish study found that people \nliving within 300\u00a0m of green space were more likely \nto use green space to exercise than people living \n1\u00a0km away. Those living further from green spaces \nhave been\u00a0found to be more likely to be obese \n(Toftager et\u00a0al., 2011). French studies have found that \nhigh-quality green space is associated with recreational \nwalking (Chaix et al., 2014) and with jogging among \nadults in Paris (Karusisi et al., 2012). In the United \nKingdom, people living in coastal environments were \nfound to be more likely to achieve the recommended \nrate of physical activity (White et al., 2013). Conversely, \na\u00a0Finnish study found that residential proximity to \ngreen space was associated with increased car use to \nreach workplaces, as, in Finland, homes surrounded \nby green space are often situated far from workplaces \n(M\u00e4ki-Opas et al., 2016).\n\nSome evidence suggests that physical activity in nature \nleads to better health outcomes than exercising in \nartificial environments (Thompson Coon et al., 2011). \nMiddle-aged adults reported feelings of restoration, \npositive emotions and vitality when walking home \nafter work through an urban park or woodland, \nversus walking through the city of Helsinki in Finland \n(Tyrv\u00e4inen et al., 2014). A project to promote walking \nin\u00a0Ireland is described in Box 3.4.\n\nSocial cohesion\n\nPositive social relationships foster health and \nwell-being, while social isolation is a known predictor \nof morbidity and mortality (Yang et al., 2016). Green \nspaces in urban areas act as hubs for community \ninteractions, foster social cohesion and reduce social \ntension, in particular for groups that are vulnerable \nto social exclusion (Burrage, 2011; Ka\u017amierczak, \n2013; ten Brink et al., 2016). Community gardens and \nallotments can provide an arena for building social \ncapital, whereby groups can meet to collaborate on \n\njoint projects, fostering social networking and raising \nenvironmental awareness (Veen et al., 2016).\n\nA systematic review of available evidence found that \ninteracting with nature facilitates social interaction, \npromotes social empowerment, reduces crime rates and \nviolence, fosters interracial interaction and supports the \nprovision of social support (Keniger et al., 2013). Studies \nfrom the Netherlands linked both the quantity and \nquality of neighbourhood greenery to social cohesion on \na local scale (de Vries et al., 2013).\n\nImproved immune functioning\n\nThe human microbiome plays a role in regulating \nthe immune system. There is evidence suggesting \nthat exposure to green space supports the healthy \nfunctioning of the immune system by fostering the \ndevelopment of a healthy microbiome (Rook,\u00a02013; \nKuo, 2015; Sandifer et al., 2015). An unhealthy \nmicrobiome is linked to allergies, asthma and other \nchronic inflammatory diseases, all of which are on \nthe increase among urban populations. Exposure in \nearly life to microbiota can reduce the likelihood of \ndeveloping allergic sensitisation (Lynch et al., 2014; \nRuokolainen et al., 2015).\n\n3.1.3 The social benefits of nature\n\nSocially deprived communities and minority groups\n\nA limited body of evidence from the United Kingdom \nand the Netherlands suggests that people living in \ndeprived neighbourhoods gain particular benefits in \nterms of health and well-being from access to green \nspace. The benefits derive from an enhanced sense of \nbelonging and reduced social isolation, as well as stress \nreduction and opportunities for physical activity. Access \nto green space in a neighbourhood may buffer some of \nthe negative effects of stressors such as unemployment \n(Ward Thompson et al., 2016). Unfortunately, reaping \nthe benefits for socially deprived communities conflicts \nwith the reality of 'green gentrification', as described \nin Section 3.3, through which the availability of green \nspaces leads to higher property prices, excluding \nlower-income families.\n\n \nBox 3.4  Encouraging walking for healthy hearts\n\nIn 1996, the Irish Heart Foundation established the 'Sl\u00ed na Sl\u00e1inte' project to promote regular walking among the population, \nas it has numerous health benefits, including cardiovascular and pulmonary benefits. Local authorities and local \ncommunities are encouraged to establish a health path/walking routes in their area. Walking can also have social benefits, \nas it provides a way to meet new people and maintain existing friendships. On some health paths, community walks are \norganised involving people from the local community or common workplaces (Irish Heart Foundation, 2019).\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n47Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFocusing on social benefits, a study from the \nNetherlands found that the relationship between green \nspace and social support was strongest for people with \na low income or a low level of education, indicating \nthat they may be more reliant on green space for social \ncontact (Maas et al., 2009b). In the United Kingdom, \nethnic groups mingle in urban parks, fostering a sense \nof community and attachment to place (Peters et al., \n2010). Cross-cultural interactions in playgrounds enable \nthe integration of minority groups and normalise \ninterracial contact (Bennet et al., 2012). The use of \nurban nature by immigrants in Helsinki was found \nto help them identify with their new communities \n(Leikkil\u00e4 et al., 2013). Urban forests in Ljubljana, Slovenia, \nwere found to support community identity, suggesting \nthat green space is an important element in establishing \na\u00a0sense of belonging (Hladnik and Pirnat, 2011).\n\nIn terms of stress relief, a UK study identified significant \nassociations between access to high-quality green \nspace and reduced psychological distress among \na\u00a0deprived urban population (Pope, 2018). A Scottish \nstudy found that higher levels of green space in \nresidential neighbourhoods were linked to lower \nperceived stress levels and healthier cortisol levels \namong a deprived urban population of unemployed \nmiddle-aged men and women (Roe et al., 2013). \nAnother study, also from Scotland, found that, as \ngreen space in a neighbourhood increased, levels \nof perceived stress decreased. In addition, the \nfrequency of visits to green spaces and views of green \nspace from the home were significant predictors of \ngeneral health (Ward Thompson et al., 2016). This \ncountry-level evidence is supported by a European \nstudy of associations between mental well-being and \neconomic strain. The study found that that good access \nto neighbourhood green space reduced the level of \ninequalities in mental well-being between well-off and \nsocially deprived groups by 40\u00a0% (Mitchell et al., 2015).\n\nRegarding mortality and morbidity, a UK study linked \nbetter access to green space to lower mortality in \ndeprived areas (Lachowycz and Jones, 2014), while \na Dutch study found that the relationship between \nlower morbidity and a green living environment was \nmore significant for children and people of lower \nsocio-economic status (Maas et al., 2009a). A project \nto increase and enhance green space in areas of \ndeprivation in Scotland is described in Box 3.5, while \nactivities to promote green space in urban areas in \nGermany are described in Box 3.6.\n\nThe links between positive birth outcomes and access \nto green space are discussed in Section 3.2.1. In terms \nof social differentiation, a UK study found that a \npositive association between the areas of greenness \na mother can access during pregnancy and birth \nweight only applied to the white population and not to \nmothers of Pakistani origin (Dadvand et al., 2014a). This \nsuggests that different perceptions and cultural norms \naffect the use and resulting benefits of green space.\n\nFinally, regarding blue space, a UK study looked at visits \nto the coast involving walking and found that females, \nolder adults and individuals from lower socio-economic \ngroups were more likely to go on coastal walks, \nsuggesting coastal amenities may support the \nreduction of activity inequalities (Elliot et al., 2018).\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nGreen spaces offer particular benefits to children \nand adolescents. There is growing evidence of the \nbeneficial effects of nature on the mental health and \ncognitive development of children (WHO, 2016d). \nPlaying in nature stimulates the development of gross \nand fine motor skills, as well as cognitive, emotional, \nsocial and physical development (Strife and Downey, \n2009). Exposure to green spaces in childhood facilitates \n\n \nBox 3.5 Green infrastructure community engagement projects in Scotland\n\nThe Green Infrastructure Strategic Intervention, which is being delivered by Scottish Natural Heritage, aims to increase \nand enhance green space in areas of deprivation in Scotland. As part of this project, the Green Infrastructure Community \nEngagement Fund supports small-scale community participation projects, tailored to the specific communities with which \nthey engage. Projects are designed from the bottom up, are locally relevant and are innovative for the area.\n\nThe projects involve groups of people working in the local area who both know and are invested in the communities that \nthe projects will benefit. The main target groups are communities in deprived urban communities. The project aims to \nencourage people to value, use and enjoy their green spaces and, through this, feel happier, healthier and better connected \nto their communities. The objective is to reduce inequalities in health and opportunities, and increase how people value \nand understand the things that nature does for them. Green infrastructure can also help people develop skills and gain the \nconfidence to seek and sustain jobs.\n\nSource:   Green Infrastructure Scotland (2019).\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n48 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nhealthy development and offers benefits for the entire \nlife course. Children who engage in outdoor physical \nactivities at a young age are more likely to maintain \nsuch lifestyles into adulthood (Kabisch et al., 2017).\n\nIn terms of evidence from across Europe, a UK study \nfound that urban green spaces are important locations \nfor children to carry out physical activity (Lachowycz \net\u00a0al., 2012). UK research found that 11-year-old children \nliving in greener urban neighbourhoods had a better \nspatial working memory (Flouri et al., 2019), and children \nraised in greener neighbourhoods showed greater \ncognitive ability at all ages (Reuben et\u00a0al., 2019). Green \nschoolyards were found to improve well-being and \nreduce physiological stress in Austrian schools (Kelz et al., \n2013). A study of 36 schools in Spain found that exposure \nto green spaces at home and at school is associated \nwith significant improvements in working memory and \na reduction in inattentiveness (Dadvand,\u00a02015). For \nthe Spanish study, this association was mediated by a \nreduction in exposure to air pollution. Other studies \nhave also demonstrated the positive impact of green \nspace exposure on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \n(ADHD) and related symptoms (Amoly et al., 2014; \nMarkevych et al., 2014). Children with attention deficit \nissues have been found to concentrate better after \nwalking in the park, with parents observing improved \nsymptoms after activities in green settings, compared \nwith indoor activities (Faber Taylor and Kuo, 2009).\n\nA Swiss study found that urban green spaces provide \nplaces for children and young people, in particular \nyoung immigrants, to develop their social networks, \nfostering cross-cultural friendships and promoting \nsocial inclusion (Seeland et al., 2009).\n\nThe elderly\n\nOlder adults are often the most sedentary segment \nof the community and also have an increased risk of \nchronic disease. There is limited research focusing on \nthe benefits of green spaces specifically for elderly \npopulations. A UK study found that higher levels \nof greenness around residential areas and living \ncloser to natural environments contributed to better \nphysical functioning at older ages, with proximity to \nboth green and blue space associated with a slower \ndecline in walking speed and grip strength (de\u00a0Keijzer \net al., 2018). In the Netherlands, senior adults \nliving in proximity to green space reported better \nhealth (de Vries et al., 2003). Another Dutch study \nfound that high-quality green spaces strengthened \ncommunity networks among the elderly, with the \nsafety and maintenance of the green spaces having \nbeen identified as important factors influencing \nuse (Kemperman and Timmermans, 2014). Social \ninteraction is especially important for older people, \nas social isolation is significantly associated with \nincreased mortality.\n\n \nBox 3.6 German federal activities to promote green space in urban areas\n\nIn Germany, political actions at the federal level are increasingly focusing on the development of urban green spaces, with \nthe aim of reaping the health and social benefits of these and contributing to environmental justice.\n\nIn 2017, the federal government launched a new urban funding programme entitled 'Future urban green spaces' (BMI, 2019), \nrecognising the importance of green spaces in cities as part of urban planning funding programmes and aiming to improve \nthe urban green infrastructure. The new programme also contributes to environmental justice through the fair distribution \nof high-quality urban green spaces.\n\nIn addition, in 2017, the federal government launched the White paper \u2014 green spaces in the city (BMUB, 2018). It \nrecommends federal government actions to support municipalities and other stakeholders in strengthening urban green \ninfrastructure. It puts an emphasis on developing urban green spaces in a socially just and healthy way.\n\nIn 2019, this white paper was followed by the 'Master plan for urban nature' (BMUB, 2019). With 26 measures in place, the \nfederal government supports the municipalities to increase the diversity of species and biotopes in German cities. The aim is \nto create natural, green habitats that benefit plants and insects and provide space for recreation, physical activity and social \ninteraction. Several measures explicitly emphasise environmental justice through the fair distribution of high-quality urban \ngreen infrastructure.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n49Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nIn a context in which 74\u00a0% of the EU population resides \nin cities (UN DESA, 2019), ensuring the provision of \nadequate green and blue spaces to support physical \nexercise and relaxation and provide places for people \nto meet and interact is an important public health \nissue. Effectively incorporating accessible, high-quality \ngreen space into the design of urban environments has \nthe potential to promote physical activity and reduce \nthe health burden of sedentary lifestyles (Sallis et al., \n2016). Research on access to natural areas has focused \non green space in urban areas, with a lack of evidence \nregarding access to blue space. Hence, this section \nfocuses mostly on green space.\n\n3.2.1 Factors determining access to urban green space\n\nThe extent to which urban residents make use of green \nand blue spaces is influenced by the accessibility, \navailability and proximity of green areas, the quality of \nthe natural space and perceived safety. Since the health \nbenefits linked to exposure to greenery may be highest \namong disadvantaged groups, it is important to deliver \nequitable access to urban nature across all societal \ngroups.\n\nThere are also individual dimensions that will affect \npeople's use of green space, such as their personal \nmotivation to exercise. In addition, people may face \nbarriers when accessing green space because of \nrestraints on their personal mobility. \n\nAvailability and proximity\n\nStudies suggest that distance to green space matters \nmost for reaping the health benefits, with a walkable \ndistance of around 500\u00a0m proposed as a guideline \n\n(Ekkel and de Vries, 2017). A European study assessed \nthe area of green space that urban residents could \nreach within easy walking distance (10 minutes) across \ndifferent European cities using the Copernicus Urban \nAtlas data (Poelman, 2018) \u2014 the results are presented \nin Map 3.1. The study found significant variation in the \narea of urban green spaces close to urban populations \nacross Europe. There was no relationship between the \nproximity of urban populations to green space and city \nsize. For capital cities with over 1 million inhabitants, \nthe areas of easily accessible green space varied \nfrom 12 hectares in cities such as Athens, Bucharest, \nBudapest, Dublin, Lisbon, Paris and Rome to more than \n50 hectares in Prague and Stockholm.\n\nA positive finding is that, in about a quarter of the \ncities under review, including Glasgow, Madrid, Prague, \nStockholm, Torino and Vienna, 98\u00a0% of the urban \npopulations had green areas within walking distance. \nHowever in about 10\u00a0% of cities, including cities in \nItaly and Romania, over 20\u00a0% of people had no green \nspace within walking distance. Importantly, the share \nof green space in the total city area was not indicative \nof proximity for urban populations. For example, while \nonly 6.5\u00a0% of land in Thessaloniki is green, 98\u00a0% of the \npopulation are within walking distance of green areas \n(Poelman, 2018).\n\nA 2016 study assessed the availability of green space in \n299 European cities and confirmed the variation across \nEurope. Northern European cities were found to have \na higher average availability of green space because of \nthe presence of forests. In contrast, southern European \ncities showed below-average levels of green space \navailability, which can be explained by their low levels \nof tree cover and the historical structures of such cities \n(Kabisch et al., 2016).\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Green space in urban areas fosters health and well-being. With green spaces offering significant benefits to \ndisadvantaged groups, it is important to deliver equitable access to urban nature.\n\n\u2022 Access to green space is determined primarily by proximity to residence, perceived safety, particularly for women and \nthe elderly, and quality.\n\n\u2022 There is significant variation in the accessibility of urban green space across Europe. In a quarter of European cities, the \nmajority of the urban population have access to green space within walking distance, while in 10\u00a0% of cities more than \na fifth of people have no green space within walking distance.\n\n\u2022 There is evidence linking social deprivation to reduced access to urban green space from a few European countries. \nHigher house prices in greener residential areas is also a factor driving unequal access. \n\n3.2 Access to green space in urban areas\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n50 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nSafety\n\nPeople's interest in using a green or blue space can \nbe affected by perceived risks to their personal safety. \nIn areas of social deprivation, groups may engage in \nantisocial behaviour in green spaces, making others \nfeel unsafe. In particular, women are more affected by \nsafety concerns than men (Ward Thompson et al., 2016). \nA Dutch study found that the use of green spaces by the \nelderly was influenced by perceived safety (Kemperman \n\nand Timmermans, 2014). Safety issues should therefore \nbe considered by urban planners looking to improve \naccess to green and blue spaces.\n\nQuality\n\nProximity to urban green space does not guarantee \nuse; rather, use is influenced by typology, physical \nentry points, functions and quality (Poelman,\u00a02018). \nLandscape attractiveness has been found to \n\nSource:  Poelman (2018).\n\nMap 3.1  Access to green urban areas within a 10-minute walk in cities across Europe\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b00\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n\n-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0-40\u00b0-50\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n30\u00b0\n\n-30\u00b0\n\n-30\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n-20\u00b0\n\n-20\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n80\u00b0\n\n0\n\n-60\u00b0\n\n-60\u00b0\n20\u00b0\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km\n\nAccess to green urban areas within a ten minute walk in cities across Europe\n\nHectares\n\nNo data\n\n< 10\n\n15-20\n10-15\n\n20-25\n25-30\n\u2265 30\n\nUrban centre population\n\n< 100 000 \n\n250 000-500 000\n\n100 000-250 000\n\n500 000-1 000 000\n\n1 000 000-5 000 000\n\n\u2265 5 000 000\n\nOutside coverage\n\nNo data\n\n70\u00b060\u00b0\u00b0 60\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\nCanary Islands (ES)\n\nAzores Islands (PT)\n\nGuadeloupe and\nMartinique Islands (FR)\n\nFrench Guiana (FR)\n\nMayotte Island (FR)\n\nR\u00e9union Island (FR)\n\nMadeira Islands (PT)\n\nSvalbard (NO)\n\n\u00a9 EuroGeographics Association for the administrative boundaries\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n51Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ncontribute to the frequency of visits to green areas \n(Roemmich et al., 2006). The presence of amenities, \nsuch as benches, parking and toilets, and the \nabsence of litter, dog waste and graffiti increase the \nattractiveness of green spaces. A Dutch study found \nthat the positive health effects of green spaces were \nrelated to quality elements, such as maintenance, \nsafety and the absence of litter (van\u00a0Dillen et al., 2012). \nSize is also a factor for physical activity (Ekkel and \nde Vries, 2017). Factors such as mixed land use \nand traffic levels can also influence the usability \nof green spaces and infrastructure. Health trails, \ncycling, walking and jogging routes, and opportunities \nfor the infrastructure to be used to reach daily \ndestinations, such as work, school and shops, can also \nincrease\u00a0usage.\n\n3.2.2 Inequalities in access to urban green space and \necosystem services\n\nExploring how parks are spatially distributed relative to \nthe needs of communities can inform urban planning \nin cities and towns so that it can provide more equal \naccess. The distribution of green spaces in urban \nareas may be significantly biased towards certain \nlocations and specific social groups (Schindler et al., \n2018). European Quality of Life Surveys demonstrate \na socio-economic gradient in access to green spaces \n(Eurofound, 2016). Deprived communities are more \nlikely to live in densely populated urban areas, where \naccess to green space can provide opportunities for \nrelaxation and social interaction. \n\nThere is evidence of a link between social deprivation \nand reduced access to high-quality green space from \na\u00a0small number of European countries. An English study \nfound that the provision of green space was worse in \ndeprived areas than in affluent areas (Brown\u00a0et al., 2010). \nIn Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, it was shown \nthat the richest 25\u00a0% of the population enjoyed access \n\nto 2.7 times as much green space as the most deprived \n25\u00a0% (Drayson, 2014). A study in Porto, Portugal, found \nthat deprived neighbourhoods had a higher average \ndistance to green space, which was also of lower quality \nand had safety concerns, structural damage and fewer \namenities (Hoffman et al., 2017). A recent Dutch study \nfound links between aspects of social deprivation, higher \nlevels of air pollution, lower levels of green space and a \nhigher prevalence of depression (Generaal et al., 2019). \nWhile most districts in Berlin have sufficient access to \ngreen spaces in terms of area and proximity, access \nrates are lower for immigrant communities (Kabisch and \nHaase, 2014). A recent analysis of access to green and \nblue space and links to social deprivation in Ireland is \npresented in Box 3.7.\n\nIn terms of drivers of inequalities in access to urban \ngreen space, access to high-quality green space \ndrives up house purchases and rental prices, thus \nexcluding poorer households (Mitchell et al., 2015). \nThrough 'green gentrification', households of lower \nsocio-economic status are displaced from areas \nthat have become valued for their green spaces \n(Cole et al., 2017).\n\nGreen spaces are under pressure in Europe, with \nongoing urbanisation and densification eliminating or \ndegrading urban green spaces. The economic value \nof land drives private landowners to favour property \ndevelopment over maintaining green areas. The \nconversion of private urban green space into built \nstructures is often not offset by the provision of more \npublicly available green space (Haaland and van den \nBosch, 2015). Maintaining green spaces also requires \nsustained investment, which presents barriers to \ncity administrators at times of economic constraints. \nAcross urban areas in 31 European cities, Fuller and \nGaston\u00a0(2009) documented a dramatic drop in green \nspace per capita in cities with greater population \ndensities and found that, as cities grow per capita, \naccess to green space declines.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n52 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 3.7  Access to green and blue spaces in Ireland\n\nA recent study from Ireland explored patterns in access to green and blue spaces, self-reported health and social deprivation \non multiple scales. \n\n'Accessible' implies that a space is available for the general public to use free of charge and without time restrictions, \nalthough some sites may be closed to the public overnight and there may be parking fees.

These benefits are particularly relevant \nto urban areas, where there are dense populations \nexposed to air pollution, noise and, in some cases, \nextreme temperatures.\n\nMore broadly, green infrastructure can increase the \nresilience of urban ecosystems and enhance carbon \nstorage over the longer term. Green space is needed \nfor the healthy functioning of a city's ecological \nsystems and to ensure the delivery of local ecosystem \nservices for human health. While this is important, it \nis beyond the scope of this report and is therefore not \nconsidered further here. \n\nThe various pathways through which green \ninfrastructure contributes to mitigating environmental \nrisks are shown in Figure 3.3. Concrete examples \nof the implementation of nature-based solutions in \nurban areas are described in Boxes 3.8 to 3.12.\n\n3.3.1 Climate change and green space\n\nGreen and blue spaces are likely to play a significant \nrole in mitigating and adapting to the effects of \nclimate change (Demuzere et al., 2014). \n\nUrban heat\n\nUrban temperatures are likely to increase over the \ncoming century, along with associated health impacts \n(Breitner et al., 2014). In particular, the urban heat \nisland effect can be counteracted by vegetation \nproviding shade, as well as through the cooling process \nof evapotranspiration (Scott et al., 2016). The magnitude \nof the cooling in question is dependent on the type, size, \nhealth and density of the given vegetation. The canopy \ncover of trees is closely linked to resulting cool, with \ndeciduous trees providing better cooling effects than \nconiferous trees (Meier and\u00a0Scherer, 2012).\n\nA systematic evidence review found that urban \nparks are, on average, 1\u00a0\u00b0C cooler than other urban \nenvironments, during both the day and the night \n(Bowler et al., 2010b). Furthermore, this cooling effect \nspreads out up to 1\u00a0km from the park boundary. \nCooling can also result from street trees and green \nroofs in urban environments (Shisegar, 2014). The \npresence of water bodies in green space may induce \ngreater cooling effects (V\u00f6lker et al., 2013). For \nexample, in Lisbon, Portugal, a cooling effect was \ndemonstrated several kilometres from a body of \nwater (Burkat et al., 2016).\n\nThese services may come at a cost, since local cooling \nthrough vegetation may only be possible through high \nlevels of irrigation in warm, dry climates. The use of \nnative species is generally considered preferable, as \nthey are already adapted to local conditions and to \nmaintaining a balance within the local ecosystem. \n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Green and blue spaces can help to address the impacts of climate change, such as the urban heat island effect and \nfloods. Urban green spaces can also stabilise urban temperatures and reduce energy requirements for the heating and \ncooling of buildings, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u2022 Green spaces can increase noise attenuation and reduce the potential for noise nuisance, particularly in built-up areas.\n\n\u2022 Green and blue spaces can support a reduction in water pollution by, for example, using green and blue spaces to \ncollect/absorb rainwater, thus reducing the overall pressure of storm water on the sewer system and the potential for \ncombined sewer overflows.\n\n\u2022 Increased vegetation in urban spaces is also reported to be beneficial in terms of air quality; however, it is not a \nsolution for urban air-quality problems.\n\n\u2022 Urban vegetation can also contribute to carbon sequestration, although the effect may be minor in relation to the \noverall emissions of greenhouse gases in an urban area.\n\n3.3 The environmental benefits of green and blue spaces\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n55Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nReduced greenhouse gas emissions\n\nReducing the urban heat island effect also reduces \nbuilding energy consumption, which has economic \nand environmental benefits (Francis et al., 2017). For \nexample, in Chicago it was found that, by increasing \ntree cover in the city by 10\u00a0%, the total energy \nfor heating and cooling was reduced by 5-10\u00a0% \n(Sorensen et al., 1997).\n\nThe effect that increased vegetation density has on \ngreenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere is clear \nglobally (IPCC, 2018). Although urban green spaces \ntake in more carbon than they emit to the atmosphere, \ntheir contribution to greenhouse gas removal within \ncities is less clear cut. When a carbon footprint analysis \nwas applied to an urban green space project in Leipzig, \nGermany, total net sequestration was predicted \nto range between 137 and 162 MgCO2 per hectare \n\nSource:  Based on Livesley et al. (2016). \n\nFigure 3.3  Examples of the benefits of green infrastructure\n\nNoise reduction\n\nHabitat for urban \nbiodiversity\n\nShade cools buildings\nand saves energy\n\nTranspiration\n cooling\n\nEnergy savings in\nshaded buildings\n\nCO2 uptake\n\nParticle\ndeposition\n\nRainfall interception \n& evaporation\n\nGreen infrastructure\nreduces the urban heat\n\nisland effect \n\nReduced\nwater runoff\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n56 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n(Strohbach et al., 2012). Further research is required to \nunderstand these dynamics in different contexts.\n\nReduced flooding risk\n\nWith an expected increase in the frequency and \nseverity of flooding events in Europe, there is a need for \nbetter protection. Urban trees and vegetation intercept \nand store water as part of urban catchment hydrology \n\n(Livesley et al., 2016). Similarly, urban blue spaces can \nstore rainwater and prevent flood damage. Action \ntaken by the city of Lisbon to adopt nature-based \nsolutions for water management is described in \nBox 3.9. \n\nFurthermore, green roofs have been shown to play an \nimportant role in storm water management in both \nnorthern (Richter and Dickhaut, 2016) and southern \n\n \nBox 3.8  Blue Green Dream \n\nThe Blue Green Dream project is dedicated to mapping and exploiting the benefits of nature-based solutions, to achieve \nurban sustainability and climate change resilience. The approach integrates both green and blue infrastructure, to provide \nthese solutions.\n\nThe project has demonstration sites in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. For example, in Paris, \nFrance, the hydrological behaviour of one hectare of green roof space is monitored to understand interactions between \ngreen infrastructure and water. These innovations demonstrate the benefits of blue and green spaces for climate change \nmitigation and adaptation. \n\nThe photo below shows the vegetated green roof called the Blue Green Wave, located at Cite Descartes, at the \u00c9cole des \nPonts ParisTech campus.\n\nPhoto: \u00a9 Climate-KIC / HM&Co \u00c9cole des Ponts Paris Tech.\n\n \nThe project produced a Blue Green Solutions Guide (Bozovic et al., 2017), including a framework for unlocking the multiple \nbenefits of green infrastructure in cities to deliver resilient, sustainable and cost-effective solutions. The framework can be \napplied at the scale of the individual building, the neighbourhood and the city.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n57Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nEurope (Fioretti et al., 2010). A UK study determined \nthat average rainfall retention on a green roof was \n65.7\u00a0%, while for a bare roof it was 33.6\u00a0%. Annual \nrainfall retention for Manchester city centre could be \nincreased by 2.3\u00a0%, as a result of a 10\u00a0% increase in \ngreen roofs (Speak et al., 2013).\n\n3.3.2 Noise and green space\n\nThere are two main ways of reducing noise pollution: \nreduction at source through adaptation and noise \nabatement through anti-propagation measures. \nVegetation can reduce sound levels through the \nabsorption of sound energy and the redistribution \nof sound energy (ten Brink et al., 2016). In addition, \nnoise levels are expected to be reduced in large green \nspaces, such as parks in cities. Vegetation in urban \nenvironments can also alter the individual perception \nof noise annoyance (Marry and Delabarre, 2011). \n\nVegetation, in particular tree belts, has also shown \npromise in achieving traffic noise reductions \n(Fang and Ling, 2003; Van Renterghem, 2014). There \n\nis the potential to generate significant noise reductions \nthrough the implementation of effective and intelligent \nurban planning. This is also linked to the concept of \n'quiet areas', considered in Section 4.3.4.\n\nGreen roofs have been shown to reduce traffic noise \n(Yang et al., 2012). Green roofs may offer greater \nnoise reduction potential in street canyons, as a \nridge roof reduces traffic noise more than a flat roof \n(Van Renterghem, 2015).\n\n3.3.3 Water quality and green space\n\nThe beneficial impacts that green spaces have on \nwater quality can be significant. In urban areas, green \ninfrastructure, such as bioswales, green roofs and \nrain gardens, can reduce water run-off into natural \nsurface water bodies and reduce pollution load \n(Pataki\u00a0et al.,\u00a02009; Gregoire and Clausen, 2011; Todorv \net al.,\u00a02018). A review of green roof performance in \nmanaging run-off water indicated that there is a need \nfor more research to identify the role that green roofs \ncan play in urban drainage planning (Berndtsson, 2010). \n\n \nBox 3.9 Green space in Lisbon\n\nThe Portuguese city of Lisbon won the European Green Capital Award for 2020. Lisbon was hailed as a role model for \ncombining sustainability and economic growth, after undertaking major steps towards sustainable land use and urban \nmobility, promoting green growth and adopting nature-based solutions for water management and climate change \nadaptation. \n\nIn delivering sustainable land use, the municipalities established a network of nine green corridors, in order to counteract \nthe effects of climate change, such as drought, extreme heat, and storm flooding. This green infrastructure also supports \nbiodiversity and provides ecosystem services, including air pollution mitigation and space for recreation and urban farming. \nThe city has planted 60 000 tress and seen a 16 % increase in new and renewed green space since 2008, expected to reach \n20 % by 2022. There are 650 organic allotments using collected rainwater and composting organic waste, projected to \nincrease to 1 000 by 2021. In Lisbon, 85 % of people already live within 300 m of green urban areas, with the municipality \naiming to bring that proportion up to 93 %. \n\nUnder a masterplan for drainage in Lisbon, nine rainwater retention solutions have been constructed across the city to \ncollect and store rainwater and reduce the effects of flash floods. Since 2013, the city has put in place efficiency and leakage \ncontrol measures that reduced drinking water consumption by 50 %. Looking forward, recycled water will be used to water \nthe city's green spaces. \n\nIn terms of action on climate change, Lisbon reduced CO2 emissions by 42 % between 2002 and 2014, and reduced energy \nconsumption by 28 % between 2012 and 2017. In 2016, Lisbon was the first capital in Europe to sign the New Covenant of \nMayors for Climate Change and Energy. \n\nLisbon has a clear vision for sustainable urban mobility, with measures to restrict car use and prioritise cycling, public \ntransport, and walking. In 2017, Lisbon launched a bike-sharing scheme, with electric bikes comprising two thirds of the \nfleet to encourage cycling in the hillier parts of the city. It has one of the world's largest networks of electric vehicle charging \npoints, with 91 % of the municipal light duty car fleet made up by electric vehicles. In Lisbon, 93 % of people live within 300\u00a0m \nof public transport. Reducing the price of public transportation to EUR 1 per day drove a 30 % increase in the use of public \ntransportation since April 2019.\n\nSource:   Private communication from Lisbon Municipality.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n58 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nDenman et al. (2016) also found evidence of trees being \nable to remove nutrient pollutants and some heavy \nmetals from storm water; however, the overall utility of \nthis as a planned approach to attenuating storm water \nis very limited.\n\nHigh rainwater loadings in combined sewer systems \n(i.e. systems that collect both rainwater and sewage) \ncan also result in the release of untreated effluent \nwhen the receiving waste water treatment plant \ncannot accept the additional loading; such releases \n\nare known as combined sewer overflows. This is likely \nto become more prevalent in some areas, as climate \nchange increases the likelihood of high rainfall events. \nThe collection and/or absorption of rainwater by \nblue and green spaces can help to reduce the storm \nwater loading in combined sewer systems and thus \nreduce the potential for combined sewer overflows \n(Pennino et\u00a0al., 2016).\n\nFurthermore, there may be benefits for water quality \nthat can be accessed by using wetlands to treat \n\n \nBox 3.10  The Hamburger Deckel\n\nThe Hamburger Deckel is an infrastructure improvement to one of Germany's busiest and longest motorways, the A7, which \nhas six lanes and carries 152\u00a0000 vehicles daily (Petrov, 2014).\n\nIncreasing congestion prompted local residents to express concern over noise and air pollution, as well as the lack of access \nbetween districts on either side. The City of Hamburg announced the development of the Hamburger Deckel, which is to be \ncompleted by 2025. Construction began in 2012, replacing three sections of highway with tunnels and creating a variety of \naccessible green spaces, including open meadows, parks, community gardens and cycle paths.\n\nThe solution not only provides effective noise mitigation through intelligent urban planning measures but also reduces air \npollution in the area and reconnects districts. It represents an example of how intelligent urban planning can be used to \nmitigate environmental risks.\n\nPhoto: \u00a9 Beh\u00f6rde f\u00fcr Wirtschaft, Verkehr und Innovation Hamburg.\n\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n59Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ndomestic sewage or waste water. In urban areas, the \nuse of constructed wetlands as a water-quality control \nsystem has increased (Thomas et al., 2016).\n\n3.3.4 Air pollution and green space\n\nTrees can help to improve ambient air quality. A study \nby the Nature Conservancy (2016) found that the \naverage reduction in particulate matter (PM) near a tree \nwas between 7\u00a0% and 24\u00a0%. In the United Kingdom, an \nestimated 1.4 billion kilograms of air pollutants were \nremoved by natural vegetation in 2015, amounting to \na saving of GBP\u00a01 billion in health costs (Jones et al., \n2016). In Strasbourg, France, it was estimated \u2014 using \nthe i-Tree Eco model\u00a0(3) \u2014 that, between 2012 and \n2013, 88 tonnes of pollutants were removed from \nthe city, representing 7\u00a0% of PM with a diameter of \n10\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM10) emitted into the city's atmosphere \n(Selmi\u00a0et al., 2016).\n\nGreen roofs have been shown to improve air quality \nwithin cities, with evidence suggesting that they may be \nable to remove PM10 from the air at a rate of between \n0.42 and 9.1\u00a0g/m2 per year (Francis et al.,\u00a02017). \nPugh et al. (2012) found that the rate of pollutant \ndeposition can be increased by planting vegetation \nin street canyons. This effect can reduce pollutant \nconcentrations by up to 40\u00a0% for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) \n\nand 60\u00a0% for PM. Green walls and roofs have also been \nshown to be more effective than trees in urban canyon \nsettings (Pugh et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, some research has warned of the dangers \nof overestimating the extent to which urban trees are \nable to appreciably affect atmospheric concentrations \nin polluted cities (Pataki et al., 2009). In reality, the \nextent of the beneficial effects will depend on the use \nof intelligent planning and the species of tree used in \na\u00a0particular location (Yang et al., 2015). Research by the \nUK Air Quality Expert Group concluded that 'overall, \nvegetation and trees in particular are regarded as \nbeneficial for air quality, but they are not a solution \nto the air quality problems at a city scale' (Air Quality \nExpert Group, 2018).\n\nIn some situations, trees may actually exacerbate \nlocal pollution by reducing the air ventilation \n(Vos\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013). As a result, planting hedges or green \nwalls may be more desirable than planting trees in \ncertain locations (Pugh et al., 2012). In addition, plants \nand trees emit volatile organic compounds, which \ncan result in the formation of ozone and PM (Sartelet \net al., 2012). These effects are known as ecosystem \ndisservices, and they are likely to be species and site \nspecific (Pataki et al., 2009). Plants can also generate \npollen, which can have an impact on people who suffer \nfrom hay fever or asthma.\n\n \nBox 3.11  Green networks in cities\n\nThere are several cities across Europe that use green corridors to promote clean airflows.\n\nLondon's action plan 'All London Green Grid' (Greater London Authority, 2012) lays out plans to 'enhance London's strategic \nnetwork of green and open natural and cultural spaces' and to increase the usage of these spaces.\n\nLjubljana's environmental protection programme presents its spatial plan for a network of green space or 'green system', \nconnecting parks in the city with corridors and circular connections to the greener rural spaces outside the city, to generate \nairflows of clean air.\n\nBarcelona City Council is developing a number of 'urban green corridors' through its green infrastructure and biodiversity \nplan 2020 (Barcelona City Council, 2012). These corridors will include strips with high concentrations of vegetation, to be \nused exclusively by pedestrians and cyclists. \n\n(3) https://www.itreetools.org/eco\n\nhttps://www.itreetools.org/eco/\f\nThe benefits of nature for health and well-being\n\n60 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 3.12  High-rise forests \u2014 Milan's Bosco Verticale\n\nGiven the constraints that cities place on urban planners in terms of space, there has been a suite of increasingly innovative \nways to increase the area of tree cover in\u00a0cities.\n\nBosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is the brainchild of architect Stefano Boeri.

A number of environmental risks \nare examined in detail in the following sections, \nincluding ambient air pollution, noise, climate change, \npoor-quality water, chemicals, indoor air quality \nand radiation. Environmental risks are not evenly \ndistributed across society, both in terms of exposure to \nrisks and the resulting impacts on health (see Box 4.1). \n\nIn addition, the cumulative effects of exposure to \nmultiple stressors are examined. Understanding \n\n4 Environmental impacts on health \nand\u00a0well-being\n\nof the links between the environment and human \nhealth has evolved from perceiving them as isolated \nissues to recognising the interdependencies \nbetween complex systems, which means that these \nissues must be addressed at a more systemic and \nintegrate\u00a0level. \n\nThe evidence presented in the following sections \nnot only clearly illustrates the negative effects that \nenvironmental pollution is currently having on \nour health and well-being but also highlights the \nopportunities to put in place measures to address key \ndrivers of the environmental burden of disease and \nimprove quality of life, which at the same time will \nhelp to address issues such as climate change and \nbiodiversity loss.\n\n \nBox 4.1  The vulnerability of children to environmental stressors\n\nChildren are more vulnerable than adults to environmental risks. First, they breathe more air, consume more food and drink \nmore water than adults in proportion to their weight. Second, the central nervous, immune, reproductive, endocrine and \ndigestive systems of a child are still developing. During certain critical windows of vulnerability, exposure to environmental \ncontaminants can lead to irreversible damage. Third, children behave differently from adults and have different patterns \nof exposure to environmental hazards. Young children crawl on the ground and can therefore be exposed to dust and \nchemicals that accumulate on floors and soils. Finally, children have little control over their environments. Unlike adults, they \nmay be both unaware of risks and unable to make choices to protect their health. Because of these unique vulnerabilities, \nchildren need special protection from environmental hazards.\n\nSource:   WHO (2017c). \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n62 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFigure 4.1  Overview of environmental stressors addressed in this report\n\nCHEMICALS\n\nNOISE\n\nWATER POLLUTION\n including bathing, surface \n\nand drinking water\n\nRADIATION\nincluding ionising and \n\nnon-ionising\n\nAIR POLLUTION  \nincluding indoor \nand outdoor\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nBUILT ENVIRONMENTS \nincluding housing and \nurban planning\n\nSource:  EEA. \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n63Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n(4) Escape (http://www.escapeproject.eu/index.php).\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe, with around 400 000 premature deaths \nattributed to air pollution in Europe in 2018. \n\n\u2022 Mortality attributed to air pollution results from ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, cancers and respiratory infection.

Short- and long-term \nexposure of children and adults to air pollution \n\nis linked to reduced lung function, respiratory \ninfections and aggravated asthma. Air pollution \nis classified as carcinogenic (IARC, 2013), while \nemerging evidence links exposure to air pollution \nto new-onset type\u00a02 diabetes, obesity, systemic \ninflammation, ageing, Alzheimer's disease and \ndementia (WHO Europe, 2016a). The EU-funded \nEuropean Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects\u00a0(4) \nidentified a significant link between PM and the \nincidence of lung cancer (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., \n2013). A recent global review found that chronic \nexposure can affect every organ in the body, \ncomplicating and exacerbating existing health \nconditions (Schraufnagel et al., 2019). Emerging \nevidence suggests that chronic exposure to air \npollution may play a role in driving susceptibility to \nCOVID-19, with further research required.\n\nAir pollution also has considerable economic impacts, \ncutting lives short, increasing medical costs and \n\n4.2 Ambient air quality and health\n\nhttp://www.escapeproject.eu/index.php\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n64 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.2  An overview of ambient air quality policy\n\nImprovements in ambient air quality in Europe are driven by two directives: the Ambient Air Quality Directive \n(Directive\u00a02008/50/EC) (EU, 2008a) and Directive\u00a02004/107/EC (EU, 2004). These specify air quality standards, known as \nlimit values or target values, for a range of pollutants. They also specify how, where and when these pollutants should be \nmonitored. Competent authorities are required to implement measures to improve air quality if limit values are exceeded \nand to maintain these standards when air quality is good.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has published air quality guidelines for specific pollutants, based on health \nimpacts (WHO, 2006). For several pollutants, the WHO guidelines are more stringent than current EU standards, and the \nstandards are currently being reviewed by the WHO. Some European countries have chosen to apply these more stringent \nWHO standards on a national basis. Under the European Green Deal, the Commission is expected to propose to revise air \nquality standards to align them more closely with the World Health Organization recommendations (EC, 2019a).\n\nThe EU Seventh Environment Action Programme includes the action to safeguard the EU's citizens from environment-related \npressures and risks to health and well-being by ensuring that, by 2020, 'outdoor air quality in the Union has significantly \nimproved, moving closer to WHO recommended levels' (EU, 2013a).\n\nAmbient air quality policies are also intrinsically linked to legislation on emissions of air pollutants, which regulates the \nsources. These relationships are summarised in Figure 4.2. The EEA annual report on air quality in Europe provides further \nbackground information on international and EU policies (EEA, 2019c).\n\n \n\nNote:   Sulphur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM2.5), \nnitrogen\u00a0oxides\u00a0(NOx) and ammonia\u00a0(NH3).\n\nSource:  EEA.\n\nFigure 4.2  EU clean air policy \u2014 the policy framework\n\nEmissions\n\n- Industrial Emissions Directive \n- Medium Combustion Plants Directive \n- Eco-design Directive\n- Energy efficiency\n- Euro and fuel standards\n\nSource-specific\nemission standards\n\nNational emission totals for\nSO2, NOx, VOC, PM2.5 and NH3 (\n\na)\n\nNational Emission\nCeilings Directive \n\nAir Quality Directives\n\nMaximum concentrations of \nambient air pollutants\n\nConcentrations\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n65Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nreducing productivity through working days lost across \nthe economy.\n\nFine PM \u2014 particulate matter with a diameter of \n2.5\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM2.5) \u2014 is one of the most relevant \npollutants linked to health problems and premature \nmortality. It\u00a0is estimated that, in 2018, there were \nabout 379\u00a0000 premature deaths in the 28 Member \nStates of the EU (EU-28) attributable to PM2.5. \nFurthermore, 19\u00a0400 deaths were attributable to \nozone exposure and 54\u00a0000 to NO2 exposure\u00a0(5) \n(EEA, forthcoming).\n\nIn terms of non-communicable diseases causing deaths \nattributable to air pollution, ischaemic heart disease is \nmost significant, with over 112\u00a0000 deaths in the EU-28 \n\nin 2016, according to World Health Organization (WHO) \nestimates (WHO, 2018a). Other significant diseases \nattributed to air pollution and leading to deaths include \nlung cancer, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, with the percentage of deaths from these \nnon-communicable diseases that is attributable to \nair pollution in the WHO European Region presented \nin\u00a0Table 4.1.\n\nNevertheless, premature deaths due to PM2.5 have \nreduced significantly since 1990, when approximately \n1 million premature deaths were linked to \nPM2.5 (EEA, 2018b). The overall trend in premature \ndeaths associated with PM2.5 is shown in Figure 4.4 and \ncan be explained through the successful reduction in \nemissions driven by policy requirements.

Map 4.1 indicates \nthat the greatest impacts of PM2.5 on YLL are seen in \ncentral and eastern European countries, with the lowest \nimpacts seen in north and north-west Europe. For NO2, \nthe pattern is different, with YLL being highest in western \nEurope and lowest in northern Europe.\n\nIn addition to the above 'classical' air pollutants, there \nare certain pollutants that are not taken into account in \nregulatory monitoring that may also have an impact on \nhuman health. For example, an appraisal by the French \nAgency for Food, Environmental and Occupational \nHealth and Safety (ANSES) highlighted the need to \ncollect data on ultrafine particles, black carbon and \n\n1,3-butadiene (ANSES, 2018). With these pollutants \nexcluded from current health impact assessments, \nunderestimations are likely. In particular, the impact \nof\u00a0mixtures of pollutants is also not captured.\n\n4.2.2 Sensitivity of vulnerable groups\n\nAir pollution affects people in different ways. Individuals \nmay be more sensitive to the health impacts of air \npollution because of their age, pre-existing health \nconditions and particular behaviours. The most \ndeprived people in society often have poorer health \nand\u00a0less access to high-quality medical care, increasing \ntheir vulnerability.\n\nAir pollution can compound existing health conditions. \nA study in Wales found that all-cause mortality and \nrespiratory disease mortality were highest in the most \ndeprived areas, as air pollution compounded the effect \nof deprivation on health (Brunt et al., 2017). In Dublin, \n\nNote:  The ranges of YLL/100 000 represent quintiles of the population. \n\nSource:  EEA (forthcoming).\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km0\n\nYears of life lost per 100 000 population attributable to PM2.5 and NO2 (2018)\n\n< 5\n5-53\n\n84-140\n53-84\n\n\u2265 140\n\nYLL/100 000 YLL/100 000 \n\n< 478\n\n478-634\n\n894-1 517\n\n634-894\n\n\u2265 1 517 No data Outside coverage\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\nNO2PM2.5\n\nMap 4.1\t\t Years\tof\tlife\tlost\tper\t100\u00a0000\tof\tthe\tpopulation\tattributable\tto\tPM2.5 (left) and NO2 (right) in 2018\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n68 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\npatients with disabling disease were at a higher risk of \nmortality if they were admitted on days with high air \npollution (Cournane et al., 2017). However, in some \ncases the evidence is not as clear; in another study, \npre-existing risk factors for stroke did not increase \nsusceptibility to the effects of air pollution on stroke \nrisk (Maheswaran et al., 2016).\n\nAge also affects sensitivity to air pollution. For example, \nin London, air pollution levels were associated \nwith the number of older people admitted to \nhospitals for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases \n(Halonen et al., 2016). A study in Dublin also linked \nhigher 30-day mortality (i.e. mortality within 30 days \nof admission) in elderly hospital patients to higher \nlevels of nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution on their \nadmission day  (Cournane et al., 2017).\n\nFor children, air pollution has a negative effect on \nneural development and cognitive capacities, which in \nturn can affect performance at school and later in life, \n\nleading to lower productivity and a lower quality of life \n(Unicef, 2017). Exposure to traffic-related air pollution in \ninfancy has been associated with reduced lung function \nthat extends into adolescence (Schultz et al., 2016).\n\nPregnant women are considered to be at greater \nrisk from air pollution, with maternal exposure to \nambient air pollution associated with adverse impacts \non fertility, pregnancy, newborns and children \n(WHO,\u00a02018f). Recent research found that fine particles \ncan cross the placenta, leading to foetal exposure \n(Bov\u00e9\u00a0et al., 2019).\n\n4.2.3 Exposure to air pollution across Europe\n\nLarge parts of the EU population continue to be \nexposed to levels of air pollution known to damage \nhealth.

In addition, in 2018, 15\u00a0% of the \nEU-28 urban population was exposed to levels of PM \nwith a diameter of 10\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM10) above the daily \nlimit value, while 48\u00a0% was exposed to PM10 levels above \nthe stricter WHO air quality guideline value. For PM2.5, \nthe respective figures were 4\u00a0% and 74\u00a0%, while 99\u00a0% of \nthe EU urban population was exposed to ozone levels \nabove the WHO guideline value (EEA, forthcoming).\n\nSpecific patterns are observed in terms of variation \nin exposure to air pollution across Europe. For PM \n\n(e.g.\u00a0PM2.5), levels in eastern Europe are higher \nbecause of the higher levels of emissions (see \nMap\u00a04.2). NO2\u00a0concentrations are highest in the \nmore densely populated areas and are related to \nlocal sources, such as traffic, domestic and industrial \nemissions (see\u00a0Map\u00a04.3). Ozone is formed in the \natmosphere as a result of reactions involving other \npollutants, driven by sunlight. Warmer regions with \nmore sunlight therefore tend to have higher ozone \nconcentrations, resulting in a north-south divide. \nExposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), an indicator of \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is more \nsignificant in central and eastern Europe (EEA, \nforthcoming).

In large \nparts of Europe, poorer people are more likely to live \nnext to busy roads or industrial areas and so face \nhigher levels of exposure to air pollution.\n\nAt the same time, exposure patterns vary across \nEuropean cities. In some cities, wealthier people \n\nlive in central, polluted areas, while in other \nEuropean cities central areas are inhabited by \npoorer communities. A study in England and the \nNetherlands (Fecht et al., 2015) found populations \nwith the lowest socio-economic status to be exposed \nto the highest concentrations of PM10 and NO2. \nOther studies found people of lower socio-economic \nstatus to be exposed to higher levels of NO2 in \nLondon, Lille and Marseille (Aether, 2017; Padilla et \nal., 2016), and PM10 and NO2 in Dortmund (Shrestha \net al., 2016). In contrast, in Bristol (United Kingdom) \nand Rotterdam (Netherlands), the most and least \ndeprived neighbourhoods were exposed to similar \nconcentrations of PM10 and NO2, explained by the fact \n\nMap 4.3  Concentration interpolated map of NO2\t(annual\tmean,\t\u03bcg/m3) for 2018\n\nSource:  EEA (forthcoming).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n71Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nthat affluent people live in polluted, city centres in \nthese cities (Fecht et al., 2015).\n\nOn a regional scale, a Europe-wide study (Richardson \net al., 2013) found that income-related inequalities \nin exposure to PM10 contributed to mortality \ninequalities specifically in eastern Europe but not in \nwestern Europe. The study also found people living in \nlower-income regions to be more susceptible to the \nhealth effects of PM10 than wealthier people living in \npolluted areas. Therefore, even when exposed to the \nsame level of pollution, those of lower socio-economic \nstatus can be more negatively affected. This could \nrelate to factors such as access to healthcare, \nunderlying health\u00a0conditions and poor housing \nconditions.\n\nA recent EEA assessment explored the association \nbetween exposure to air pollution and dimensions \nof social vulnerability in regions across Europe\u00a0(6) \n(EEA,\u00a02018a). Areas characterised by lower \nsocio-economic status were found to have higher \nlevels of PM2.5, PM10 and ozone pollution. For NO2, \nthe\u00a0opposite was found, with wealthier areas \nexperiencing higher levels of NO2 pollution.\n\nThe most vulnerable 20\u00a0% of the larger (Nomenclature \nof Territorial Units for Statistics Level\u00a02 \u2014 NUTS\u00a02) \nregions, in relation to unemployment, household \nincome and education levels, had PM2.5 and \n\nPM10 pollution levels that, on average, were 1.3 to \n1.5\u00a0times higher than those experienced by the least \nvulnerable 20\u00a0% of the regions. The spatial distribution \nof exposure to PM2.5 and gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita is illustrated in Map 4.4, which shows the \nspatial coincidence of poverty and pollution in eastern \nand south-eastern Europe. A factor driving this pattern \nis energy poverty, which is more prevalent in southern \nand central-eastern Europe. Poorer communities rely \non the combustion of low-quality solid fuels, such as \ncoal and wood, in low-efficiency ovens for domestic \nheating. This results in exposure to PM and PAHs, both \nindoors and outdoors (EEA, 2019c).\n\nIn contrast, the economic aspects of social vulnerability \n(GDP\u00a0(7) per capita at NUTS\u00a03 level and household \nincome deprivation at NUTS\u00a02 level) were only weakly \nassociated with ozone exposure. Despite this, the \npoorest 20\u00a0% of smaller (NUTS\u00a03) regions were \nexposed, on average, to ozone SOMO35\u00a0(8) levels that \nwere 1.3 times larger than those experienced by the \nwealthiest 20\u00a0%. This is linked to warm climates driving \nozone formation, with no causal link between poverty \nand ozone being suggested.\n\nWhile some associations can be drawn at the larger \nNUTS\u00a02 and NUTS\u00a03 levels, there is a need for more \nregional, small-scale studies to assess the links between \nsocio-economic status and air pollution at a finer \nspatial level.\n\n(6) The analysis focused on Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics\u00a0(NUTS) 2 and 3.\n(7) GDP is an indicator of economic activity.

Children are more at risk of \nimpacts on their cognitive development, have less well-developed coping strategies and less control over noise than \nadults.\n\n\u2022 Evidence linking lower socio-economic status and exposure to noise is mixed, with associations influenced by local \nfactors, such as property value in city centres.\n\nEnvironmental noise is one of the top environmental \nrisks to both physical and mental health and well-being \nin Europe (see Figure 4.6). This is reflected in the EU's \nSeventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP), \nwhich guided European environmental policy up \nuntil 2020 and included the action to ensure that, by \n2020, 'noise pollution in the Union has significantly \ndecreased, moving closer to WHO-recommended \nlevels' (EU, 2013a). However, the latest EEA assessment \non noise in Europe indicates that the number of people \nexposed to high levels of noise has not decreased, \nwith millions of people still exposed to noise levels that \nare harmful to their health (EEA, 2020a). This 7th EAP \nobjective has therefore not been achieved. An overview \nof relevant policies is provided in Box 4.3.\n\n4.3.1 Health impacts of noise pollution\n\nExposure to noise can lead to auditory and \nnon-auditory effects on health. Through direct injury \nto the auditory system, noise leads to auditory effects, \nsuch as hearing loss and tinnitus (WHO Europe,\u00a02018). \nThis is frequently caused by loud work noise, loud \nmusic (e.g. from continuous high exposure to personal \nmusic devices and/or at music venues) or loud \nfireworks (WHO, 2004; WHO and ITU, 2019).\n\nHowever, there are other effects that occur at levels far \nbelow those causing hearing impairment if exposure \nis long term. These are called non-auditory effects of \nnoise (see Box 4.5) and are the result of psychological \nand physiological stress reactions (Basner et al., 2014). \nRepercussions of these stress reactions are extensive \n\nand include annoyance, poor sleep, cardiovascular and \nmetabolic effects, and cognitive impairment in children \n(WHO Europe, 2018). While some studies have also \nfound links between mental health and exposure to \nnoise, there is a need to carry out significantly more \nresearch in this area, to determine the potential effects \n(Clarke and Paunovic, 2018).\n\nFigure 4.7 illustrates how exposure to noise affects \nhealth and well-being. Within the population exposed \nto elevated levels of noise, stress reactions, sleep-stage \nchanges, and other biological and biophysical effects \nmay occur. These may, in turn, lead to a worsening of \nvarious health risk factors, such as blood pressure. For \na relatively small part of the population, the subsequent \nchanges may develop into clinical symptoms, such as \ninsomnia and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe most recent EEA assessment of the health impacts \nof noise from roads, railways, aircrafts and industry \nin Europe found that noise contributes to 48\u00a0000 new \ncases of heart disease per year and 12\u00a0000 premature \ndeaths (see Table 4.2). Over 21 million people suffer \nhigh annoyance due to noise, while nearly 6.5 million \nhave their sleep disturbed. As a result of aircraft noise, \n12\u00a0500 schoolchildren suffer learning impairments in \nschool (EEA, 2019a).\n\nBased on data from six European countries, H\u00e4nninen \net al. (2014) estimated that the environmental burden \nof disease associated with transport-related noise is \nbetween 400 and 1\u00a0500 disability-adjusted life-years \n(DALYs) per million people, making it the second highest \nenvironmental burden of disease in western Europe, \n\n4.3 Environmental noise and health\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n74 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFigure 4.6  Noise pollution exposure and impacts in Europe\n\n20 % of the EU population \u2014 \none in five people \u2014 live in areas \nwhere noise levels are considered \nharmful to health. \n\nHIGH\nANNOYANCE\n\n22 000 000\n\nHIGH SLEEP\nDISTURBANCE\n\n6 500 000\n\nHEART\nDISEASE\n\n48 000\n\nPREMATURE\nMORTALITY\n\n12 000\n\nCOGNITIVE\nIMPAIRMENT IN \n\n12 500\n\nCHILDREN\n\n \nBox 4.3  An overview of policies addressing environmental noise\n\nWithin the EU, the main instrument used to identify and enable action on noise pollution is Directive\u00a02002/49/EC (EU, 2002), \nknown as the Environmental Noise Directive (END). This requires Member States to publish both noise exposure maps and \nnoise management actions plans on a 5-year basis. The END also recognises the need to preserve areas of good acoustic \nenvironmental quality, referred to as 'quiet areas', to protect the European soundscape. \n\nRecently, the World Health Organization noise guidelines for the European region have been updated to better support the \nprotection of human health from exposure to environmental noise. This resulted in new guideline values for road, rail and \nair traffic, and for wind turbines (WHO Europe, 2018). \n\n \nBox 4.4  Development of a comprehensive approach for the determination of non-auditory health impacts\n\nThe relationship between environmental noise exposure and non-auditory human health impacts is very complex and \ndepends not only on basic measurements of the physical noise in an area but also on non-acoustic factors, such as \nattitudinal, situational and socio-demographic factors.\n\nA report by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) (ANSES, 2013a) \nrecommends that a number of additional non-acoustic determinants are taken into consideration, to fully account for the \neffects of environmental noise on human health, in addition to the underlying and measurable physical characteristics of \nthe noise in question. These are split into two groups, as identified below, and should be incorporated into research on \nthe health impacts of environmental noise, to develop more definitive relationships between exposure and non-auditory \nimpacts.\n\nSocio-demographic factors Attitude factors\n\nGender, age, level of education, residential status \n(i.e. owner/tenant), professional dependence on the \nsource of the noise, use of the noise source, personal \nhistory\n\nSensitivity to noise, attitude towards the source \n(fear, usefulness), ability to deal with the noise, \nhaving confidence in the actions of public authorities, \nsatisfaction with the local environment, activities in \nprogress\n\nSource: EEA (2020a).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n75Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nafter air pollution from fine PM. Efforts to translate the \nhealth costs of noise into economic costs in the UK are \ndescribed in Box 4.5.\n\n4.3.2 Sensitivity of vulnerable groups\n\nRelatively few studies have been conducted to \ninvestigate disparities in exposure to environmental \nnoise in vulnerable groups. Those that have, for the \nmost part, have focused on children. The assessment \nof the impacts of noise exposure is complicated by \nthe fact that people living quite close to each other \ncan experience substantially different levels of noise \nexposure. This is generally not the case with other \nenvironmental stressors, such as air pollution, through \nwhich larger spatial areas tend to be exposed to similar \n\nconcentrations of a given pollutant. The potential \nimpacts of noise exposure on a number of different \nvulnerable groups are presented below.\n\nAge vulnerability\n\nWhile there is a need for more studies in this area, \nthere is already evidence of a relationship between \nnoise exposure and a decline in children's cognitive \nability. For example, aircraft noise was shown to impair \nreading and oral comprehension in children attending \nschools under flight paths (Clark and Paunovic, 2018). \nIt is considered that, psychologically, children are \npoorer at appraising threats from environmental \nstressors and also have fewer well-developed coping \nstrategies (Clark et al., 2013).\n\nNoise originating from other modes of transport \nhas also been shown to have an impact on children \n(Stansfeld and Clark, 2015). For example, a recent \nstudy in Norway suggested that road traffic noise \nhas a negative impact on children's attention (Weyde \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). Lim et al. (2018) also reported that noise \nand noise sensitivity are negatively associated with the \nmental health of children and adolescents, particularly \nin low-income groups.\n\nThere is no evidence that elderly people are \ndisproportionately affected by noise (van Kamp and \nDavies, 2013); however, there is evidence that older \npeople are more at risk of suffering from cardiovascular \neffects due to noise (Tobias et al., 2014). Noise has \nalso been found to affect middle age ranges more \nwhen annoyance and disturbance are considered \n(Van Gerven et al., 2009).\n\nNoise-sensitive people\n\nNoise-sensitive people are individuals who tend to \nhave a specific discriminating sensitivity towards noise \n\nSource:  Based on WHO (1972).\n\nFigure 4.7  Pyramid of the health effects of noise\n\nMortality\n\nDisease\ninsomnia,\n\ncardiovascular\n\nRisk Factors\nblood pressure, cholesterol,\n\nblood clotting, glucose\n\nStress indicators\nautonomous response, stress hormones\n\nFeeling of discomfort\ndisturbance, annoyance, sleep disturbance\n\nNotes: (a) Refers to mortality due to ischaemic heart disease. \n\nSource:  EEA (2020).\n\nTable 4.2  Estimated number of people suffering from different health outcomes due to environmental \nnoise in 2017, EEA-33 (Turkey not included)\n\nHealth effect Estimated number of people affected\n\nHigh annoyance 21\u00a0868\u00a0500\n\nHigh sleep disturbance 6\u00a0476\u00a0600\n\nIschaemic heart disease 48\u00a0000\n\nCognitive impairment in children 12\u00a0400\n\nPremature mortality (a) 12\u00a0100\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n76 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nand thus tend to be more annoyed by noise exposure \nthan others. This highlights the subjective element of \nnoise disturbance, as different individuals can exhibit \ndifferent levels of annoyance to the same noise, \nwhich can be unrelated to their physical ability to hear \nsounds (Shepherd et al., 2010). This noise sensitivity \ncan degrade the quality of life of individuals through \nincreased annoyance and sleep disruption (Shepherd \net al., 2010). Associations between noise sensitivity and \nvarious mental health-related factors, such as anxiety, \ndepression, higher benzodiazepine usage and future \npsychiatric disorders, have also been reported (Lim \net\u00a0al., 2018).\n\nSocio-economic status\n\nSocio-economic status can also be associated with an \nindividual's vulnerability to noise exposure. A broad \nreview of the existing evidence of the links between \nsocial inequality and environmental noise exposure \n(Dreger et al., 2019) concluded that, while findings \nwere mixed, studies that used indicators of material \ndeprivation and deprivation indices found higher \nenvironmental noise exposure in lower socio-economic \ngroups.\n\nIn the Netherlands, greater exposure to road and rail \nnoise were linked to increased depressive symptoms \nin lower-education groups (Putrik et al., 2015). This has \nalso been identified for self-reported sleep problems \ncaused by neighbourhood noise (Arber et al., 2009). \nIn addition, those living in more deprived locations in \nSouthampton were found to have less access to quiet \nareas (Battaner-Moro et al., 2010). However, a Swiss \nstudy identified no direct link between socio-economic \nstatus and the risk of dying from a heart attack in areas \n\nexposed to aircraft noise; instead, it found that the \nlength of time spent in a residence exposed to high \nlevels of noise was the main factor increasing the risk \nof a heart attack (Huss et al., 2010). A study in London \n(Tonne et al., 2018) also found that inequalities in \nroad traffic noise exposure were generally small. This \nreflects the fact that those from more affluent social \ngroups may choose to live in areas more affected by \nnoise, for example in the city centre of Paris (Havard \net al., 2011) or in a prestigious area located close to a \nlarge airport (Tonne et al., 2018).\n\nEurostat also collects data on the percentage of \nhouseholds reporting noise from neighbours or the \nstreet. These data indicate that a higher percentage \nof lower income households report issues with noise \nfrom neighbours or the street. In 2017 and 2018, the \npercentages of lower income households reporting \nnoise issues were 18.1\u00a0% and 18.8\u00a0%, respectively, while \nthe percentages for higher income households were \n14.4\u00a0% and 16.5%, respectively (Eurostat, 2019e).\n\nThe variations in the findings of different studies \nindicate that noise exposure is very much subject \nto local factors. As such, locally conducted \nsmall-scale studies can assess whether or not \nthere is a relationship between noise exposure and \nsocio-economic status (Dale et al., 2015, Dreger et al., \n2019). As an example, a study on population exposure \nto noise in homes in Malta is provided in Box 4.6.\n\nThere are also differences between individual \ncountries. For example, in Croatia, Greece, Poland and \nRomania people at risk of poverty were less likely to be \nsubjected to noise from neighbours or the street than \nthe general population. This is because a high share of \n\n \nBox 4.5  The economic impact of noise exposure: a UK example\n\nOne way of quantifying the damage caused by noise exposure across Europe is in terms of the economic impact. Harding \net al. (2013) conducted a study in the United Kingdom focusing on three health problems strongly associated with \nnoise-induced high blood pressure, namely heart disease, stroke and dementia cases.\n\nThe team monitored noise levels at 1\u00a0160 sites across the country, between 2000 and 2001, and combined these data with \ninformation on the age and sex of UK residents, to calculate the added health problems from noise pollution exposure.\n\nThey used 'quality-adjusted life-years' (QALYs), which take into account quality of life, combining years spent living and years \nspent coping with a non-life-threatening illness. The researchers calculated the health impacts of noise exposure above \n55\u00a0dB LAeq16hr to cost EUR\u00a01.34 billion per year (based on a value for 1 QALY of GBP\u00a060\u00a0000).\n\nFurthermore, these are simply intangible costs, arising from the loss of healthy life-years due to morbidity and mortality. \nIf the study had considered the economic impacts of treatment, these figures would be much greater. For example, in \nthe United Kingdom, in 2008, approximately 99\u00a0% of the total costs for dementia were attributable to the combined \ncosts of healthcare and social and informal care, and less than 1\u00a0% of costs were attributable to morbidity and mortality \n(Harding et\u00a0al., 2013). \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n77Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\npeople at risk of poverty in these countries live in rural \nareas (Eurostat, 2019f). In contrast, in countries where \npoverty is more concentrated in cities, such as Belgium, \nGermany and France, those at risk of poverty report \nhigher levels of noise from the streets or neighbours.\n\nA recent EEA assessment explored the links between \nsocial deprivation and noise exposure at a European \nlevel. It considered the proportion of people exposed \nto road noise of Lden\u00a0\u2265\u00a055\u00a0dB\u00a0(9) and Lnight\u00a0\u2265\u00a050\u00a0dB\u00a0(10) \n(night noise levels) and socio-economic data in \nrelatively large spatial units. The results must be \ninterpreted carefully, as it was assumed that noise \nexposure was uniform across the spatial units for \nwhich the socio-economic data were available. In \nreality, exposure to noise is much more localised than \nexposure to air pollution, and ambient levels vary \nconsiderably across short distances.\n\nFor the most part, associations between noise \nand social vulnerability were much less clear than \nassociations between air pollution and social \nvulnerability. There was found to be a relatively \neven distribution of the proportion of people \nexposed to Lden\u00a0\u2265\u00a055\u00a0dB and Lnight\u00a0\u2265\u00a050\u00a0dB across the \nEuropean regions. There were associations between \nthe proportion of people exposed to noise and \nunemployment in urban audit cities and household \nincome deprivation, suggesting that cities and regions \ncontaining poorer populations are more exposed to \nnoise. It must be noted, however, that, across cities, \nthere is a high variability in the percentage of people \nexposed in the different income categories, meaning \nthat there are cities with relatively high exposure levels \nacross all ranges of deprivation (EEA, 2018a).\n\n4.3.3 Exposure to noise across Europe\n\nNoise exposure\n\nUnlike air pollution, in relation to which there can \nbe complex relationships between the source and \nsubsequent air quality over a wide area, noise \npollution has the greatest impact near to its source. \nAt a macro-level, the spatial distribution of road noise \nexposure has been found to show no large-scale \npatterns across Europe (EEA, 2018a). In addition, there \nwas no systematic difference between urban and \nrural areas. This is likely because of data constraints, \n\nbut it also potentially reflects the fact that, in rural \nareas, noise exposure may be high if dwellings are \nconcentrated around roads with heavy traffic, while in \ncity centres high noise areas can be seen as desirable \nplaces to live. In rural areas, sources of noise can also \ninclude farming activities (tractors, harvesters, animals).\n\nIn terms of sources of noise, the road transport \nnetwork is the most widespread noise source, and \nthis is true on an EU scale, a country scale and both \ninside and outside urban centres. It is estimated that \n113\u00a0million people are exposed to traffic noise levels \nof\u00a0at least 55\u00a0dB Lden, with 22 million exposed to railway \nnoise, 4 million exposed to aircraft noise and less \nthan 1 million exposed to industrial noise. Overall, this \nmeans that at least 20\u00a0% of Europeans are exposed to \nnoise of at least 55\u00a0dB Lden, at which health effects can \noccur. Figure 4.9 shows the number of people exposed \nto noise above 55 dBLden in the years 2007, 2012, and \n2017, with an increase seen in exposure to noise from \nroad, rail and air traffic in urban areas, and to noise \nfrom rail traffic in rural areas.\n\n4.3.4 Quiet areas in Europe\n\nGiven the value of quiet areas for human health, as well \nas for biodiversity, it is important to identify and protect \nareas in Europe that are potentially quiet (EEA, 2016b). \nIt is estimated that 18\u00a0% of Europe's rural land area is \nnot likely to be affected by high levels of noise, while \n33\u00a0% remains potentially adversely affected by noise \npollution (EEA, 2016b). \n\nThe level of potential quietness is depicted using the \nQuietness Sustainability Index. The Index ranges from \n0 to 1, with 0 implying a noisy area and 1 implying \na potential quiet area (EEA, 2014). Map 4.5 shows \nthe location of potential quiet areas in Europe. The \nnorthern part of Europe has the most potential \nquiet areas. Countries that have high population \nand transport network densities tend to have fewer \npotential quiet areas in the open countryside.\n\nQuiet areas have been found to provide other benefits. \nFor example, health-related quality of life is highest \nin quiet rural locations (Shepherd et al., 2013), and \nthere is evidence that individuals suffering from illness \nrecover faster in natural surroundings (Ulrich, 1984; \nKaplan, 1995; Alvarsson et al., 2010).\n\n(9) Lden is a long-term average indicator designed to assess annoyance and defined by the Environmental Noise Directive. It refers to an A-weighted \naverage sound pressure level over all days, evenings and nights in a year, with an evening weighting of 5\u00a0dB(A) and a night weighting of \n10\u00a0dB(A). High noise levels are defined in the 7th EAP as levels above 55\u00a0dB Lden.\n\n(10) Lnight is a long-term average indicator defined by the Environmental Noise Directive and designed to assess sleep disturbance. It refers to an \nA-weighted annual average night period of exposure. High noise levels are defined in the 7th EAP as levels above 50\u00a0dB Lnight.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n78 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.6  Case study: population exposure to noise in homes in Malta\n\nIn 2011, 30.4\u00a0% of the Maltese population reported being exposed to noise in their homes \u2014 this is significantly higher than \nthe EU average, of 19.8\u00a0%, for the same year.\n\nAn analysis of noise nuisance data based on income quartiles indicated that more than twice as many people in the lowest \nincome quartile reported major noise problems when compared with the wealthiest quartile.

In Europe, 2014, 2015 and 2018 were the \nwarmest 3 years on record (EEA, 2019d), and recent \nsummer temperatures lie significantly outside the \nrange of expected natural variability (Luterbacher et al., \n2016). The summer of 2019 also saw record-breaking \nheatwaves across Europe.\n\nClimate change poses major risks to health, leading to \ninjuries and increasing the risk of both communicable \nand non-communicable diseases. Conditions such as \nextreme heat, wildfires and floods pose a direct risk \nto health, while longer term risks, such as changes in \nthe distribution of infectious diseases and allergens, \nare mediated through changes in ecosystems and \nsocio-economic systems (EASAC, 2019).\n\nThe elderly, people with ill health, pregnant women, \nchildren and migrant and marginalised populations \nare most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate \nchange. Urban areas with dense populations are \nalso particularly vulnerable, with climate change \n\nheavily influencing the microclimates of cities. During \nheatwaves, the effect of heat can be exacerbated in \ncities, and this is particularly problematic in regions \nwhere buildings are designed for cold environments \n(EEA, 2016c). Higher mortality rates are seen in dense \nurban areas, as a result of the heat island effect. \nClimate change also contributes to health risks in the \nindoor environment, including high temperatures, poor \nindoor air quality, increased allergens and pathogens, \nflood damage and water contamination (Vardoulakis \net al. 2015). Flooding, water scarcity and droughts also \npose threats to cities.\n\nUnder the worst-case, high-emission (RCP8.5)\u00a0(11) \nscenario, extreme heatwaves considerably stronger \nthan those that occurred in 2003 are projected to occur \nas often as every 2 years in the second half of the 21st \ncentury (EEA, 2017b). The frequency and intensity of \nall extreme weather events is expected to increase this \ncentury. Oceans and marine environments, coastal \nzones, freshwater systems and terrestrial ecosystems \nwill also be affected (EEA, 2017a).\n\nAn overview of climate change adaptation policies \nis provided in Box 4.7. Regarding emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, the European Green Deal set out \nthe Commission\u2019s ambition to make Europe the first \nclimate-neutral continent by 2050. In March 2020, \nthe Commission proposed a European Climate Law \n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Climate change contributes to the burden of disease and premature deaths in Europe.\n\n\u2022 Direct health effects include death, injury and the increased risk of food- and water-borne disease, resulting from \nextreme temperatures, floods and forest fires.\n\n\u2022 Indirect impacts result from changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases and allergens, \nreductions in agricultural productivity and contaminated water sources.\n\n\u2022 Heatwaves are the deadliest extreme weather event in Europe. The 2003 heatwave caused 70\u00a0000 premature deaths in \nEurope. City dwellers are more exposed to extreme heat because of the heat island effect.\n\n\u2022 Floods caused over 8\u00a0000 deaths in the 33 EEA member countries between 1980 and 2016.\n\n\u2022 The elderly, the sick, children, pregnant women and socially deprived communities are more vulnerable to climate \nchange impacts because of increased sensitivity and reduced resilience.\n\n\u2022 Socially deprived communities are more exposed to extreme temperatures and floods because of the poor quality of \ntheir housing. \n\n(11) Scenarios to support climate change research and assessments are called representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The RCPs provide \na consistent set of trajectories for future atmospheric composition and land use change up to the year 2100. The four RCPs are named from \nRCP2.6 to RCP8.5, according to their approximate radiative forcing level in the year 2100.\n\n4.4 Climate change and health\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n82 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n(EC,\u00a02020f), which includes a legally binding target of \nnet zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, aiming to \nprotect health, food systems and ecosystems and to \nincrease social resilience to climate change. \n\n4.4.1 Health impacts of climate change\n\nThe effects of climate change on human health are \nwide ranging. Climatic changes, such as heatwaves \nand increased precipitation, have an impact on human \nhealth, both directly or indirectly (McMichael, 2013) and \nexacerbate problems that already exist (EEA,\u00a02016c; \nEEA,\u00a02017a). Direct impacts include traumatic injury or \ndeath, post-traumatic stress and disease risk. Indirect \nhealth impacts result from socio-environmental \nchanges, such as reduced food yields jeopardising \nnutritional status and causing displacement, \ninfrastructure damage creating physical hazards and \nchanges in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases.\n\nIn terms of deaths attributable to climate change, \nduring the period 1980-2017, climate- and \nweather-related events caused 90\u00a0325 additional \ndeaths across the 33 EEA member countries (EEA-33). \nHeatwaves are the deadliest type of extreme weather \nacross Europe as a whole, with 68\u00a0% of additional \ndeaths (77\u00a0637) attributed to heatwaves over the same \nperiod (EEA,\u00a02019e). In eastern Europe, cold events and \nstorms cause the highest number of excess deaths \n(CRED,\u00a02019). In terms of the economic impacts of \n\nclimate change, the total reported economic losses \ncaused by weather- and climate-related extremes in the \nEEA member countries during the period 1980-2017 \namounted to approximately EUR\u00a0453 billion, with over \na\u00a0third associated with flooding (EEA, 2019b).\n\nDeaths attributable to climate change in Europe \nare predicted to increase significantly, with a clear \ngeographical north-south divide, whereby countries \nin southern Europe will be more affected by global \nwarming than those in the north and will see more \nheat-related deaths, water stress, habitat loss, energy \ndemand for cooling and forest fires. The Mediterranean \narea appears to be the most affected by climate change \n(Ciscar et al., 2018).\n\nExtreme temperatures\n\nTemperature affects human well-being and mortality, \nwith both cold and heat having an impact on public \nhealth in Europe.\n\nHeat or hot weather that lasts for several days, \noften referred to as a 'heatwave', can result in a rise \nin mortality and morbidity (WMO and WHO, 2015). \nExposure to heat can cause heat fatigue, heat stroke \nor heat stress, and can worsen existing health issues, \nsuch as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases \nand kidney problems (\u00c5str\u00f6m et al., 2013; Analitis \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02014; Breitner et al., 2014). In addition, hot \nweather has synergistic effects with air pollution, \n\n \nBox 4.7  Policies addressing climate change adaptation\n\nThe European Commission published an EU climate change adaptation strategy in April 2013, with three main objectives \n(EC,\u00a02019g):\n\n\u2022 to promote action by Member States by encouraging all Member States to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies \nand by providing funding to help them develop their adaptation capacities and take action; to support adaptation in \ncities by launching a voluntary commitment based on the Covenant of Mayors initiative (since 2015, the Covenant of \nMayors for Climate and Energy) (Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, 2019);\n\n\u2022 to carry out 'climate-proofing' action at the EU level by further promoting adaptation in key vulnerable sectors, such \nas agriculture, fisheries and cohesion policy, by ensuring that Europe's infrastructure is made more resilient and by \npromoting the use of insurance against natural disasters and disasters caused by human activity;\n\n\u2022 to ensure better informed decision-making by addressing gaps in knowledge on adaptation and by further developing \nthe European climate adaptation platform, Climate-ADAPT (Climate-ADAPT, 2019).\n\nThe adaptation strategy has been evaluated, with lessons learnt and reflections on improvements put forward. The \nevaluation calls on EU cities to have adaptation plans in place to protect citizens from both extreme and slow-onset climate \nhazards. The plans should cater for the vulnerabilities of certain communities and the different risks faced by the very \ndiverse regions of the European continent (EC, 2018b).\n\nAn increasing number of EEA member countries have adopted national adaptation strategies, and several have developed \nand are implementing national adaptation action plans. Strategies and actions have also emerged in many cities and in \ntransnational regions across Europe, including the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian and Alpine regions.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n83Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ncompounding health impacts (De Sario et al., 2013). \nHeat-related problems are greatest in cities, where \npopulation density is high and where the urban \nheat island effect plays a role in maintaining high \ntemperatures.\n\nIn Europe, most deaths related to extreme weather are \nattributable to heatwave events. As shown in Map 4.6, \nfrom 1990 to 2016 the greatest numbers of fatalities \ndue to high temperatures were seen in western and \nsouthern Europe. However, these data are skewed by \nthe heatwave of 2003, when 70\u00a0000 excess deaths were \nreported across Europe (Robine et al., 2008).\n\nWithout the implementation of further adaptation \nmeasures, heat-related mortality is predicted to \nincrease. Under the high-emissions global warming \nscenario\u00a0(12), there could be an additional 132\u00a0000 deaths \nper year in the EU due to heatwaves by the end of the \ncentury, an increase by a factor of 50 compared with \npresent heatwave mortality. Most of these additional \ndeaths are predicted to occur in the central European \nregions and southern Europe. Under the 2\u00a0\u00b0C scenario, \nthe additional deaths per year are predicted to be 58\u00a0000 \nfor the period 2025 to 2055 (Ciscar et al., 2018).\n\nClimate change is also projected to drive increases in \nhospital admissions in Europe because of heat-related \nrespiratory diseases, from 11\u00a0000 admissions (0.18\u00a0%) \nduring the period 1981-2010 to 26\u00a0000 (0.4\u00a0%) during \nthe period 2021-2050. Again, both the current number \nof hospital admissions and the projected increases \ndue to climate change are largest in southern Europe \n(Astr\u00f6m et al., 2013).\n\nLong warm and dry periods increase the risk of forest \nfires, bringing about severe impacts on the health of \nsurrounding populations, including death, injury and \ncardiovascular and respiratory illnesses due to air \npollution (Analitis et al., 2012). The length and severity \nof the fire seasons are increasing in the Mediterranean \nregion and southern Europe. Predictions suggest that \nthe total burnt area of Europe will double in the 21st \ncentury (Ciscar et al., 2014).\n\nAnother less highlighted risk posed by increasing \ntemperatures is the release of toxic chemicals, such as \nmercury, from melting permafrost (Schuster et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018). \nIncreasing surface water temperatures may accelerate \nthe generation and bioaccumulation of methylmercury \nand persistent organic pollutants in fish, potentially \naffecting the health of people consuming these fish \n(Dijkstra et al., 2013). An additional risk of melting \npermafrost is exposure to diseases assumed to be \ncontained, as described in Box\u00a04.8.\n\nExtreme cold can also significantly affect human \nhealth, with cold-related deaths primarily caused by \ncardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Low indoor \ntemperatures exacerbate existing conditions, such as \narthritis and rheumatism, increased blood pressure \nand the risk of stroke, and are linked to pneumonia, \nasthma, bronchitis, influenza, heart disease and \nmigraines, as well as depression and anxiety \n(WHO\u00a0Europe, 2012). At the same time, exposure to \npersistent moderately low temperatures affects health \nmore than extremely low temperatures, which only \nmarginally contribute to overall excess winter mortality.\n\nAs shown in Map 4.6, the highest numbers of fatalities \nfrom low temperatures are seen in eastern and \nsouthern Europe. Ebi and Mills (2013) also confirm \nthat mortality due to low temperatures is highest in \nwarmer countries, while in many countries with colder \nclimates excess winter deaths are less pronounced or \nabsent. Possible drivers include housing quality, energy \naffordability and the population's acclimatisation to and \npreparedness for lower temperatures.\n\nAs a result of milder winters as our climate changes, \nit is estimated that, by the 2080s, cold-related \nmortality will have decreased. However, the positive \nhealth impacts are not expected to outweigh the \nnegative health effects of climate change (McMichael \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02012).\n\nDrought\n\nThe severity and frequency of meteorological and \nhydrological droughts have increased in parts of \nEurope, in particular in south-western and central \nEurope. From 2006 to 2010, on average 15\u00a0% of the EU \nterritory and 17\u00a0% of the EU population were affected \nby meteorological droughts each year. Under severe \ndrought conditions, impacts on public water supply and \nwater quality are likely in more populated regions of \nEurope, such as central France (Stahl et al. 2016).\n\nLarge increases in the frequency, duration and \nseverity of meteorological and hydrological droughts \nare predicted to occur in most of Europe during the \n21st century, except for northern European regions. \nThe greatest increase has been predicted for southern \nEurope, increasing competition between different \nwater users, such as agricultural, industry, tourism \nand household users (EEA, 2019f). The development \nof drought management plans helps to alleviate the \nworst impacts of extended droughts. For example, in \nSpain the development of such plans is required for all \nwater supply systems serving more than 20\u00a0000 people \n(Herv\u00e1s-G\u00e1mez and Delgado-Ramos, 2019).\n\n(12) RCP8.5 \u2014 under this scenario, projections of the level of global warming exceed 3\u00a0\u00b0C warming around 2070 and continue rising thereafter.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n84 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFloods\n\nMelting ice and a rise in sea surface temperatures have \nled to rising sea levels, which are predicted to lead \nto an increase in tidal flooding, while more frequent \nheavy precipitation is predicted to contribute to \nincreased surface and fluvial flooding. Floods resulted \nin over 8\u00a0000 deaths in the EEA-33 between 1980 and \n2016 because of drowning or injuries (EEA 2017). \nMap 4.7 shows the number of deaths related \nto flooding in each EEA member country and \ncooperating country for the period 1991-2015, \nnormalised by their population. The largest numbers \n\nare found in south-eastern Europe, eastern Europe \nand central Europe.\n\nFloods also affect people after the event through \ndisplacement, the destruction and degradation \nof homes, water shortages and financial losses \n(EEA,\u00a02017a). Floods also disrupt the delivery of services, \nincluding healthcare, safe drinking water, sanitation and \ntransport, generating indirect risks to health.\n\nFor example, floods bring an increased risk of infection \nfrom water-borne diseases, such as leptospirosis \n(Picardeau, 2013). People living in buildings that \n\nMap 4.6  Number of fatalities due to extreme temperatures across Europe (1990-2016)\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km0\n\nNumber of fatalities due to extreme temperatures in European countries (1990-2016) \n\nHigh temperatures Low temperatures\n\n\u2265 10 000 No data Outside coverage\n< 100\n\n1 000-5 000\n\n100-1 000\n\n5 000-10 000\nNone \n\nre\nco\n\nrd\ned\n\n< 10\n\n50-100\n10-50\n\n\u2265 100\nNone \n\nre\nco\n\nrd\ned\n\nSource:  EEA (2019d).\n\n \nBox 4.8  Melting permafrost and anthrax\n\nIn August 2016, in a remote corner of the Siberian tundra \u2014 in a place called the Yamal Peninsula \u2014 an outbreak of anthrax \nkilled a young boy and hospitalised at least 20 other people.\n\nThe source of this bacterial infection initially perplexed scientists, but a theory soon emerged that attributed this outbreak \nto the melting of the permafrost in this area. The melting had led to the defrosting of a reindeer carcass from over 75 years \nago, which had been infected with anthrax. After the thaw, the bacteria, which had been preserved in the frozen ice, were \nreleased into nearby water systems and contaminated both human and animal drinking water (BBC, 2017).\n\nThere is a risk that, with continued permafrost melting, the vectors of potentially deadly diseases considered to be contained \ncould see a resurgence (Revich and Podolnaya, 2012). \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n85Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nhave been flooded are more at risk of infection, \nsince humidity fosters the growth of microorganisms \n(Menne\u00a0and Murray, 2013).\n\nThe stress that flood victims feel can affect their mental \nhealth for a long time after the event (Stanke et al., \n2012; Fernandez et al., 2015). Up to three quarters of \npeople affected by a flood have experienced mental \nhealth effects (Menne and Murray, 2013).\n\nFloods may have unexpected impacts, by mobilising \nchemicals in the environment through releases from \nlandfills or by remobilising pollutants deposited in soils \nand silt. One example is heightened human exposure \nto mercury as a result of increased soil erosion from \nflooding (Krabbenhoft and Sunderland, 2013).\n\nIn the absence of adaptation measures, projected \nincreases in extreme precipitation events and sea level \nwould substantially increase the health risks associated \nwith river and coastal flooding in Europe (EEA, 2017a).\n\nVector-borne diseases\n\nVector-borne diseases are transmitted by carriers, \nsuch as insects or rodents, either between humans or \nfrom animals to humans. Climate change is projected \nto induce substantial shifts in the geographical and \nseasonal distribution of vectors and their associated \ndiseases in Europe (Semenza and Menne, 2009) and \nmight enable the establishment of exotic diseases \ncurrently not present on the continent (Randolph and \nRogers, 2010).\n\nSource:  EEA (2017a) based on WHO (2016).\n\nMap 4.7  Number of European deaths related to flooding per million inhabitants, 1991-2015\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n0 500 1000 1500 km\n\n70\u00b00\u00b060\u00b00\u00b0\n\n555\n\n0 or not reported\n0.1-1\n1-2\n2-5\n5-10\n> 10\n\nOutside coverage\n\nRate per 1 000 000 inhabitant\n\nDeaths per million inhabitants\nrelated to flooding in Europe for\nthe period 1991-2015\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n86 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFor example, climate change is regarded as the \nprincipal factor driving the expansion of the tick species \nIxodes ricinus \u2014 the vector of Lyme borreliosis and \ntick-borne encephalitis in Europe \u2014 to higher latitudes \nand altitudes. Shifts in the distribution of Ixodes ricinus \ntowards more northerly regions are projected.\n\nThe Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, transmits \nthe dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, as well as \ndirofilarial worms, and has substantially expanded its \nrange in recent years, thought to be aided by climate \nchange. Several outbreaks of these viral diseases \nhave been reported in Europe (EEA,\u00a02017a). Travellers \nreturning from warmer climes may carry these diseases \nand introduce them into the local vector population, \ninitiating an outbreak. The climatic suitability for Aedes \nalbopictus is expected to increase in places where the \nclimate is projected to become warmer and wetter, \nsuch as in the south-east region of the United Kingdom \n(Medlock and Leach, 2015), the Balkans and central \nEurope. In contrast, suitability decreases in places where \nthe climate is predicted to become drier, such as in some \nregions of Spain and Portugal (Caminade et al., 2012). \n\nOther examples include predictions of a progressive \nincrease in the distribution across southern and \neastern Europe of the West Nile virus transmitted by \nmosquitos (Semenza et al., 2016), and a considerably \nbroader distribution across Europe of species of \nsandflies with the potential to act as vectors for \nleishmaniosis (Tr\u00e1jer et al., 2013). Box 4.9 outlines \nefforts to monitor disease-vectors at European level \nand in Croatia. \n\nWater- and food-borne diseases and health\n\nWith the notable exception of non-cholera Vibrio \ninfections, it is difficult to attribute specific outbreaks \nof water- and food-borne diseases in Europe to climate \nchange. At the same time, pathogens are sensitive \nto climate-related factors, with changes in these \nfactors known to affect the risks of certain food- and \nwater-borne diseases.\n\nIncreased air and water temperatures accelerate the \ngrowth rates of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses \nand parasites. For example, since 1980 the number \nof Vibrio infections, which can be life-threatening, has \nincreased substantially in the Baltic Sea states. This \nis linked to increases in sea surface temperatures, \nwhich provide ideal conditions for Vibrio blooms. The \nunprecedented number of Vibrio infections in 2014 is \nlinked to the 2014 heatwave in the Baltic region \n(Vezzulli et al., 2016).\n\nFlooding can contaminate drinking water sources \nand disrupt water treatment and sanitation systems \n(Semenza et al., 2012). Drought conditions can also \nreduce the effectiveness of water treatment facilities \n(Tran et al., 2017). Evidence of the response of \npathogens to climate factors is presented in Table 4.3.\n\n4.4.2 Vulnerable groups\n\nWhile all people in Europe will be affected by climate \nchange, certain people in society are more vulnerable \n\n \nBox 4.9  Efforts to monitor changes in the distribution of vectors\n\nEuropean activities\n\nAt the European level, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control assesses the effects of climate change \non\u00a0infectious diseases and has established a pan-EU network dedicated to vector surveillance, known as VBORNET\u00a0(a). \nThe\u00a0network undertakes targeted entomological collections in specific vector habitats to fill knowledge gaps.\n\nMonitoring mosquitos and vector-borne diseases in Croatia\n\nThe appearance of dengue fever in 2010 and the West Nile virus in 2012 in Croatia signalled an increase in the potential \nfor vector-borne diseases. Croatia saw a significant peak in vector-borne diseases in 2012 and 2013, coinciding with higher \nmean annual air temperatures. Cases were reported for malaria, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile meningoencephalitis. \nIn 2016, the Croatian Institute for Public Health started the systematic monitoring of invasive mosquito species. Monitoring \nin 2017 confirmed the presence of the Asian tiger mosquito, a vector of chikungunya, dengue and Zika, and the Japanese \nmosquito, a vector of dengue and chikungunya. These data feed into an early warning system for vector-borne diseases, \ninforming measures to control their distribution, including disinfection and public awareness raising.\n\nNote:  (a) VBORNET \u2014 European Network for Arthropod Vector Surveillance for Human Public Health (http://www.vbornet.eu).\n\nSource:   Private communication from the Croatian Institute for Public Health.\n\nhttp://www.vbornet.eu\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n87Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nbecause of their age, poor health or social deprivation. \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) definition of vulnerability is 'the propensity or \npre-disposition to be adversely affected' (IPCC, 2014). \nVulnerable people may be more sensitive to the health \nimpacts of high or low temperatures and less able to \naccess healthcare services for treatment. Certain groups \nare more exposed to extreme weather events because \nof the poor quality of their local environment and/or \nliving conditions. Finally, poorer people may be less able \nto protect themselves from extreme weather events or \nafford solutions that could reduce their exposure in the \nlong term, making them less resilient to the risks posed \nby climate change.\n\nWhy are certain groups more sensitive to the health \nimpacts of climate change?\n\nGenerally, the elderly are the most vulnerable to the \neffects of heat because of poorer physical health \n\n(Josseran et al., 2009). Elderly people suffering \nfrom dementia, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's \ndisease may be less able to keep themselves cool, \nwhile certain medications can cause dehydration. \nThe elderly are also more susceptible to cold \nspells than other age groups (Ryti et al., 2015) and \nmore likely to live in poor-quality housing. Older \npeople often live alone and are less able to take \naction to protect themselves from environmental \nstressors (Koppe et al. 2004). Regarding floods, \nneurological conditions can affect both how \na\u00a0person perceives danger and their ability to \nrespond (DEFRA, 2012). Higher levels of mortality \noccur among the elderly during floods because \nof hypothermia and heart problems (Green et al., \n1994; Vardoulakis and Heaviside, 2012). Overall, \nolder people experience more severe stress \nand mental health implications as a result of \nfloods than the general population (Menne and \nMurray,\u00a02013).\n\nSource:  Information is drawn from EEA (2017a). For additional details and references, see the source report. \n\nTable 4.3  Human pathogens that respond to climate factors\n\nPathogen Health impacts Response to climate factors\n\nVibrio Vibrio species cause gastroenteritis. Infection \noccurs through the consumption of seafood. On \nrare occasions, Vibrio infections can cause severe \nnecrotic ulcers, septicaemia and death in susceptible \nindividuals exposed to contaminated marine \nenvironments during bathing.\n\nElevated levels of non-cholera Vibrio species \ninfections have been observed during extended hot \nsummer seasons, with water temperatures above \n20\u00a0\u00b0C in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.\n\nCampylobacter Campylobacteriosis is the most common bacterial \ncause of diarrhoeal disease in Europe. Infection \noccurs via contaminated food. \n\nMore cases of campylobacteriosis are seen during \nthe summer months, associated with the ambient \ntemperature that precedes the diagnosis of cases by \n10 to 14 weeks.\n\nSalmonella Salmonellosis is the second most commonly \nreported gastrointestinal infection. Exposure occurs \nvia contaminated food. Infection occurs through \nthe consumption of contaminated food of animal \norigin, mainly eggs, meat, poultry and milk. Overall, \nthe incidence of the infection has declined steadily \nin Europe because of effective control measures in \npoultry production.\n\nAn increase in weekly temperature has been \nassociated with an increase in salmonellosis. Public \nhealth interventions can counter the impact of \nwarmer temperatures. Extreme precipitation events \nthat result in faecal contamination events have also \nbeen associated with salmonellosis.\n\nNorovirus Norovirus is the most common cause of viral \ndiarrhoea in humans. The incidence of norovirus \nshows pronounced winter seasonality. Infection \noccurs via oral contact with faecal matter or vomit \nfrom an infected person. Food or drink may become \ninfected via food handling.\n\nFood-borne Norovirus outbreaks have been linked \nto climate and weather events. Heavy rainfall \nand floods can lead to waste water overflow, \ncontaminating shellfish farming sites. Peaks in \ndiarrhoea incidence have been linked to the \nmagnitude of rainfall. Flood water was associated \nwith a norovirus outbreak in Austria.\n\nCryptosporidium Cryptosporidiosis is an acute diarrhoeal disease \ncaused by intracellular protozoan parasites, \nCryptosporidium species. Transmission occurs \nthrough the faecal-oral route via contaminated \nwater, soil or food products. The most common \nexposure routes are contaminated drinking water \nand contaminated recreational water.\n\nThe concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in \nriver water increases significantly during rainfall \nevents. Heavy precipitation can result in the \npersistence of oocysts in the water distribution \nsystem and their infiltration into drinking water \nreservoirs. Infections following heavy rainfall have \nbeen seen in Germany and Sweden.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n88 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nAt the other end of the demographic scale, children \nare highly susceptible to dehydration and heat stress \nbecause of their greater body surface area to volume \nratio (Stanberry et al., 2018). Children are more likely \nto be affected by respiratory disease, renal disease, \nelectrolyte imbalance and fever during heatwaves \n(Xu et al., 2014). Heatwaves have also been shown to \nexacerbate the effects of allergens and air pollution \n(Stanberry et al., 2018), which impact children more \nseverely than adults because of their underdeveloped \nrespiratory and immune systems and relatively high \nrates of respiration. Children living in cold homes are \nalso at greater risk of respiratory problems because of \nthe likely development of moulds (WHO Europe, 2012) \nand are thought to be more at risk of mental health and \ndisease impacts from flooding (ETC/CCA, 2018). Flooding \nhas been associated with increased mental health and \nbehavioural problems in children in the Netherlands and \nPoland (Jakubicka et al., 2010), as well as increases in the \nincidence of a range of diseases (Ahern et al., 2005).\n\nIndividuals with a poor health status are also more \nsusceptible to health risks during heat extremes \n(Wolf et al., 2015), with chronic health problems more \nprevalent among the poor.\n\nWhy might vulnerable groups face increased exposure to \nclimate change impacts?\n\nSpecific groups may face increased exposure to \nextreme temperatures, floods or droughts because \nof where they live, the quality of their housing and \ntheir ability to protect themselves from exposure \nto stressors. Single-level properties favoured by \nolder people (Pannell and Blood, 2012) mean that \nolder people are unable to retreat to higher floors \nif their home is flooded. Cold and damp housing \nconditions in the aftermath of flooding increases the \nincidence and severity of some illnesses in children \n(Marmot Review, 2011).\n\nDifferences in the exposure of people to extreme \ntemperatures are to a great extent driven by \nvariations in people's ability to maintain comfortable \ntemperatures in their home, which varies from country \nto country, as shown in Map 4.8.\n\nPeople's ability to their keep homes at a comfortable \ntemperature is linked to energy poverty, including \nthe energy efficiency of housing and the affordability \nof energy (WHO, 2012). Bulgaria, Greece, Malta and \nPortugal have high proportions of people affected \nby high summer temperatures. Importantly, the \nproportion of the general population unable to keep \ntheir home comfortably cool in summer in Europe is \n\nhigher than that unable to keep their home warm in \nwinter (WHO Europe, 2012). This suggests that heat \nmay be a growing problem as the climate changes.\n\nThe problem of heat exposure is greatest in cities. \nDense populations and demographic shifts towards \nelderly populations in many European countries \nlead to increased vulnerability, while the urban heat \nisland effect increases the frequency and intensity of \nexposure and can have an impact on both outdoor and \nindoor air quality (Buscail et al., 2012). Temperatures \nin European city centres can be up to 9\u00a0\u00b0C higher than \nin the surrounding areas (Tzavali et al., 2015) and, as \na result, urban areas may experience twice as many \nheatwave days as surrounding rural areas (Hooyberghs \net al., 2015). The urban heat island effect is stronger \nin northern European cities, while in southern Europe \nrural-urban temperature differences are less extreme \n(Ward et al., 2016).\n\nIn many European countries, socially vulnerable \ncommunities live in dense, urban environments. In \naddition, the distribution of facilities catering for \nvulnerable groups, such as care homes and hospitals, \nhave been found to be located in areas 2\u00a0\u00b0C warmer \nthan the regional average (Macintyre et al., 2018). \nHowever, the urban centres of some cities also attract \naffluent individuals, exposing a wealthier cohort of the \npopulation to urban heat.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, living in cold \nhousing contributes substantially to excess winter \ndeaths (WHO Europe, 2012). With people spending \nnearly 90\u00a0% of their time indoors (Vardoulakis et \nal., 2015), those unable to afford adequate housing \nsuffer from increased exposure to cold. The highest \nproportions of households unable to keep warm in \nwinter are found in eastern and southern Europe. \nIn\u00a02016, nearly 10 % of the households in 33 European \ncountries\u00a0(13) were unable to keep their homes warm \nin winter (Eurostat, 2016). In terms of exposure to \nthe cold, socio-economic status is linked to excess \nwinter deaths. Countries with high levels of income \npoverty, such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, show \nhigher levels of winter mortality. Within Portugal, \nmunicipalities with higher socio-economic deprivation \nlevels experienced higher excess winter mortality than \nplaces with lower levels of deprivation (Almendra et al., \n2017). The homeless are vulnerable to hypothermia, \neven in moderately cold stress conditions (Romaszko \net\u00a0al., 2017) and tend to be the immediate victims of \ncold weather (Poljan\u0161ek et al., 2017).\n\nFurthermore, there may be a link between \nsocio-economic status and exposure to vector-borne \n\n(13) The EU-28 plus Iceland, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n89Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ndiseases. For example, a causal link has been \nestablished between national socio-economic \nconditions and the upsurge in tick-borne encephalitis \nin countries in central and eastern Europe \n(Sumilo et al., 2008).\n\nRegarding floods, there is evidence from the \nUnited Kingdom and the Netherlands of a higher \nlevel of exposure of certain social groups. A recent \nUK-wide analysis suggests that socially vulnerable \nneighbourhoods are over-represented in areas \nprone to flooding from all sources, but they are most \nsignificantly over-represented in areas prone to sea \nflooding (Sayers et al., 2017). In Greater Manchester, \nUnited Kingdom, a correlation was found between \nneighbourhoods' material deprivation and their \nexposure to surface water flooding (Kazmierczak and \nCavan, 2011). Similarly, in Norfolk, United Kingdom, \nareas containing high proportions of residents with \n\nincomes below the national median or in receipt \nof a\u00a0key benefit were more likely to be exposed \nto flooding (Garbutt et al., 2015). The same study \nidentified higher proportions of older people, singleperson households and people with poor health \nor disability living in areas affected by flooding \n(Garbutt et al., 2015). In addition, in Rotterdam, the \nNetherlands, areas without flood protection contain \nhigher proportions of low-income or single-parent \nhouseholds, young children, migrants and the elderly \nthan the embanked areas (Koks et al., 2015).\n\nAn overview of the results of a vulnerability assessment \nfor a number of European cities is presented in Box 4.10.\n\nWhy are some groups less resilient to climate change?\n\nSocial factors affect an individual's ability to cope with \nclimate change impacts, in terms of both avoiding \n\nNote: Countries covered in the map on the left include the EU-28, Iceland, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland.

They are also less \nlikely to have home contents insurance (Sayers et al., \n2017) and, therefore, their relative economic losses \nare higher (Sayers et al., 2017). In the United Kingdom, \nless skilled workers and those not in work were found \nto have a lower level of awareness of flood risks than \nthose in higher socio-economic groups (Fielding, 2012); \nin Greece, low income was also linked to a low level \nof flood risk awareness (Fuchs, 2017). Furthermore, \nin Scotland, in the aftermath of flooding, people living \nin lower income households suffer from an increased \nlevel of stress (Werritty et al., 2007).\n\nSimilarly, people with little connection to the area in \nwhich they live and their neighbours (e.g. those recently \nmoved to the area, tenants) were found to be the \nleast informed about the risk of flooding (Zsamboky \n\net al., 2011) and the most likely to use public shelters \nin evacuations (Scawthorn et al., 2006). Conversely, \nwell-established social networks support emergency \nresponses and recovery (Preston et al., 2014). Social \ncapital is a crucial lifeline during heatwaves or floods, \nparticularly for those who are ill or elderly.\n\nIndividuals facing barriers to accessing information \nabout climate-related hazards may be less ready to \nrespond or less prepared in advance. Illiterate groups \nor those with a poor knowledge of the local language, \nsuch as immigrants and refugees, may therefore be \nless able to find information themselves, identify \nsolutions and plan ahead (ETC/CCA, 2018).\n\nWomen are more vulnerable to the effects of climate \nchange than men, because they have reduced access \nto justice, more limited mobility and a weaker voice in \ndecision-making and policy development. This is more \npronounced in lower income countries. Across Europe, \nsocio-economic, legal and political disadvantages as \nwell as physical and biological differences are thought \nto contribute to this vulnerability (ETC/CCA, 2018).\n\n \nBox 4.10 The vulnerability of European cities to climate change\n\nA recent indicator-based vulnerability assessment was carried out for 571 European cities. Cities more vulnerable to \nheatwaves were predominantly located in the central areas of the EU and in the southern regions of new Member States \nand the Baltic region. This was driven by the spatial coincidence of elderly populations, higher pollution levels and smaller \ndwelling sizes. Many cities in some of the warmest areas of Europe showed lower vulnerabilities, likely due to an awareness \nof the health risks of heat in these regions.\n\nCities vulnerable to drought, such as Brussels, Ludwigshafen am Rhein and Marseille, were found across Europe. Overall, \ncities with less diversified economies, growing populations and less efficient water management systems were more \nvulnerable.\n\nUrban vulnerability to flooding also occurs across Europe. The British Isles and Scandinavian countries were less vulnerable \nthan cities in Mediterranean countries, in Czechia and in the Danube river basin. Factors increasing vulnerability included \nlow income and low employment rates, physical features, such as the extent of soil sealing, public awareness of citizens' \nrights and political commitment to adaptation.\n\nFor coastal flooding, cities on the Atlantic coasts, the western Mediterranean coast and the Baltic coast showed higher \nvulnerability than those on the coasts of the Italian Peninsula, the United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries, which were \nshown to have a higher capacity to adapt, as well as a higher awareness of and commitment to addressing coastal flooding.\n\nThe study results demonstrate that, for each city, the causes of vulnerability to the consequences of climate change are \ndependent on the specific geographical and socio-economic conditions. City-level assessments are therefore required to \ninform local-scale adaptation planning.\n\nSource:   Tapia et al. (2017).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n91Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nThe EU has contributed to ensuring access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation for the population of \nits Member States through water quality standards \nand requirements for the treatment of urban waste \nwater, and much effort has been put into preventing \nthe contamination of water sources. An overview of \nEU policies on water is provided in Box 4.11.\n\nOverall, progress in providing clean drinking water and \nrecreational bathing water is good, but there are still \nsome public health concerns in specific areas, and the \nquality status of some European surface water bodies \nis also being negatively affected by the presence of \na small number of chemicals, including mercury and \nbrominated flame retardants.\n\nPollutants that are found in water bodies arise from \nvarious sources, including agriculture, industry, urban \nwaste water treatment, households and the transport \nsector (see Figure 4.10; EEA, 2018c). Once released \ninto water bodies, pollutants can be transported \ndownstream and may be discharged into coastal \nwaters.\n\n4.5.1 Surface water quality and health\n\nA recent EEA report on the ecological and chemical \nstatus of European surface waters presents a \nconcerning picture of their quality, and this has \nimplications for the environment and human \nhealth (EEA, 2018c). In total, EU Member States \nreported information on the status of more than \n111\u00a0000 surface water bodies, with only 40\u00a0% found \nto be in good ecological status and only 38\u00a0% found \nto be in good chemical status. However, groundwater \nsources presented good chemical status in 74\u00a0% of \ncases (these data are reported by surface area, based \non data reported for 13\u00a0400 groundwater bodies).\n\nThe ability to achieve a good chemical status for \nEuropean surface water bodies under the Water \nFramework Directive is significantly affected by a \nrelatively small number of substance groups, namely \nthe following (EEA, 2018d):\n\n\u2022 Mercury and its compounds: >\u00a045\u00a0000 surface water \nbodies are not achieving the required standard.\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Pathways for human exposure to water pollution include direct exposure via drinking water extracted from \ngroundwater or surface water or contact with contaminated bathing waters, as well as indirect exposure through the \nconsumption of fish containing bioaccumulative pollutants, such as mercury.\n\n\u2022 Overall, in Europe the quality of bathing water is good, with nearly 96\u00a0% of all designated sites meeting the minimum \nquality requirements set out in the EU's Bathing Water Directive and over 85\u00a0% achieving 'excellent' status. Overall, \n1.3\u00a0% of EU bathing water sites were rated as having poor water quality, and it is in these locations that the risk of \nhuman illness is particularly increased.\n\n\u2022 Drinking water quality across Europe also has high rates of compliance with the drinking water standards for the large \nsupplies that serve the majority of citizens. However, there are concerns in relation to higher levels of drinking water \ncontamination in small supplies and private wells.\n\n\u2022 The possible presence of emerging pollutants that are not currently monitored in drinking water is also a concern. A \nrevised Drinking Water Directive is expected to enter into force in 2020 and sets the requirement to monitor a limited \nnumber of additional pollutants.\n\n\u2022 The situation for groundwater bodies is positive, with 74\u00a0% (by area) achieving good chemical status. This is important, \nas they are a significant source of drinking water across Europe.\n\n\u2022 However, the quality status of surface water bodies in Europe is concerning, with only 40\u00a0% found to be in \ngood ecological status and 38\u00a0% found to be in good chemical status. The chemical status of surface water is \ndisproportionately affected by a small number of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemical substance groups. \nThis\u00a0gives rise to concerns about biodiversity loss and the potential for these chemicals to enter food chains.\n\n4.5\t Water\tquality\tand\thealth\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n92 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nAtmospheric \ndeposition\n\nUrban areas\n\nIndustry\n\nPower stations\n\nVolcanoes\n\nFreshwater \n\nSewage treatment plants\n\nLandfill/contaminated sites\n\nUrban areas\n\nRun-off from farming\n\nAquaculture\n\nWear and tear and emissions\n\nShipping\n\nHistoric/dredge spoil\n\nFigure 4.10  Possible sources of water pollution\n\nSource: EEA (2018c).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n93Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n\u2022 PAHs: compliance rates vary for different PAHs; \nfor example, there are more than 3\u00a0000 water \nbodies failing to achieve the required standard for \nbenzo(g,h,i)perylene\u00a0+\u00a0indeno(1,2,3-cd)-pyrene.\n\n\u2022 Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs): \n>\u00a023\u00a0000 water bodies are not achieving the \nrequired standard.\n\nIt was noted that, if the pollution caused by mercury \nand certain other priority substances\u00a0(14) is omitted, the \npercentage of water bodies in good chemical status \nincreases to 81\u00a0%. The most significant pathway for the \nentry of these pollutants into the water environment \nis related to the emission of these pollutants into \nthe atmosphere and their subsequent deposition \n(particularly for mercury), and releases from urban \nwaste water treatment plants (EEA, 2018d).\n\nWhile these substances are known to be individually \nharmful to both humans and the environment, there is \nalso significant concern about the impacts of mixtures \nof different chemicals, as discussed in Section 4.6. In \n\naddition, while not specifically addressed in this report, \nthere are concerns about the health risks presented by \nmicrobial contamination of water bodies.\n\nThe exposure pathways for pollutants in water \nvary. Direct exposure routes include consumption \nof contaminated drinking water and exposure to \npoor-quality bathing waters. However, particularly in \nthe case of chemicals in water, the most significant \nexposure pathway can be indirect, such as through \nthe consumption of food. For example, some fish \nspecies can have elevated levels of mercury, as a \nresult of mercury contamination in water bodies. This \nmercury can itself originate from pollutants that have \nbeen released into the air; however, direct inhalation \nof this mercury is not a significant exposure route. \nThe exposure pathways and impacts of chemicals are \ndiscussed in detail in Section 4.6, while the following \nsections look in more detail at the potential for \nexposure specifically via bathing water and drinking \nwater. Pharmaceuticals also present a particular risk \nto the water environment, with an overview of the key \nconcerns presented in Box 4.12.\n\n \nBox 4.11\t\t Water\tpolicy\toverview\n\nThere are a number of key directives that focus on the protection and enhancement of water quality in Europe. These are \noutlined briefly below.\n\nWater\tFramework\tDirective\t(EU,\t2000):\tthe aim of this directive (adopted in 2000) is to establish a coherent framework \nfor achieving the objective of 'good status' for all EU water bodies by 2015. While this ambitious objective was not met by \n2015, the Water Framework Directive continues to provide the basis for achieving this objective.\n\nDrinking\tWater\tDirective\t(EU,\t1998):\tthis directive, adopted in 1998, aims to ensure that water intended for human \nconsumption is safe. The directive requires that drinking water is free of any microorganisms, parasites or substances that \ncould potentially endanger human health. It also sets standards for the most common, potentially harmful organisms and \nsubstances that can be found in drinking water. On 1\u00a0February 2018, the Commission adopted a proposal for a revised \nDrinking Water Directive (EC, 2018c). The European Parliament and the Council reached provisional agreement on the \nrecast Drinking Water Directive in December 2019, with the Directive expected to enter into force in 2020 subject to formal \napproval. \n\nUrban\tWastewater\tTreatment\tDirective\t(EU,\t1991):\tthis directive was adopted in 1991 to protect the water environment \nfrom the adverse effects of urban waste water and industrial discharges. It requires waste water collection and treatment in \nurban agglomerations above a certain size (based on a population equivalent loading). There are also specific requirements \nfor discharges in sensitive areas (freshwater bodies, estuaries and coastal waters that are eutrophic or may become \neutrophic if protective action is not taken). The proportion of households connected to waste water treatment plants varies \nacross Europe. For example, in western-central Europe, the connection rate is 97 %, while in southern, south-eastern and \neastern European countries, the connection rate is about 70 %. Despite improvements in recent years, around 30 million \npeople are not connected to waste water treatment plants in Europe (EEA, 2019g).\n\nBathing\tWater\tDirective\t(EU,\t2006a):\tthe revised Bathing Water Directive was adopted in 2006. This sets stringent bathing \nwater quality standards for the protection of public health in both coastal and inland bathing waters. The key indicators are \nEscherichia coli (E. coli) and intestinal enterococci, which indicate contamination from either sewage or livestock.\n\n(14) Ubiquitous persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances, as defined by the Priority Substances Directive 2013: brominated diphenylethers, \ntributyltin, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)-pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n94 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.12  Pharmaceuticals in European waters\n\nPharmaceuticals can enter the water environment through the excretion of residual drugs that have been taken by humans \nor animals. Other important sources include waste water discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturing, the inappropriate \nmanagement of pharmaceutical waste and the inappropriate disposal of unused drugs. While many pharmaceutical products \nbreak down into harmless metabolites, some widely used medicines are more persistent in the environment and have \nproperties that are harmful to wildlife, such as endocrine disruption.\n\nIn general, urban waste water treatment plants are not specifically designed to remove these compounds from waste water; \nas a result, these materials are released into the water environment. A study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (Unesco) and the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (Helcom) examining pharmaceuticals \nin the Baltic Sea found that, of the 118 pharmaceutical compounds that were assessed, only nine of them were removed \nfrom waste water with an efficiency of over 95\u00a0%, and around half of the compounds were removed from waste water with \nan efficiency of less than 50\u00a0% (Unesco and Helcom, 2017). When pharmaceuticals are removed from waste water, they can \npotentially still be present in the waste water treatment plant sludges. These sludges can subsequently be applied to land, \nthrough which the pharmaceuticals can then enter the food chain and also have an impact on ecosystems. While there is still a \nhigh level of uncertainty in relation to the potential ecosystem impacts of pharmaceuticals in the water environment, but they \nhave been associated with impacts such as spawning, reproductive, developmental and behavioural effects (CHEM Trust, 2014).\n\nOne of the key issues associated with pharmaceuticals in the environment is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Bacteria naturally \ndevelop resistance to antibiotics; however, the widespread use of antibiotics in humans and animals can significantly accelerate \nthe emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These bacteria can then spread leading to increased levels of infection \namong the human and animal populations. In the broader environment, the role of AMR genes in the spread of antibioticresistant bacteria is currently unclear. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are estimated to cause 25\u00a0000 deaths \nin the EU every year, while AMR also places a burden on healthcare systems and society, with an annual cost due to healthcare \nexpenditures and productivity losses estimated at approximately EUR\u00a01.5 billion in the EU (European Medicines Agency, 2019). \nThe European Commission launched the 'One Health' action plan in 2017 to specifically address the issues of AMR, which \nincludes measures such as reducing the use of antimicrobials in both humans and animals (EC, 2017b). The plan acknowledges \nthe environment as a contributor to the development and spread of AMR in humans and animals and notes that strong \nevidence is required to better inform decision-making. The European Commission has also recently launched the 'European \nUnion strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment' (EC, 2019h) to tackle these issues and promote 'green design' \nwithin the pharmaceutical sector. The Farm to Fork Strategy recognises that antimicrobial resistance is linked to the use of \nantimicrobials in animal husbandry and human healthcare and commits to halving sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals \nand aquaculture by 2030 (EC, 2020b).\n\n4.5.2 Bathing water quality and health\n\nWithin the EU each summer, millions of Europeans \nuse water bodies and coastal waters for swimming, \nrecreation and relaxation. The Bathing Water Directive \napplies to any element of surface water where the \ncompetent authority expects a large number of people \nto bathe and does not impose a permanent bathing \nprohibition or issue permanent advice against bathing.\n\nTo manage the water quality of bathing locations, \nMember States are obliged to monitor bathing water \nduring the bathing season (which typically begins in \nspring and ends in early autumn, but this varies between \nMember States). Based on the levels of indicator bacteria \npresent in the water, the quality may be deemed \n'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor' (EEA, 2019h).\n\nFor the most part, non-compliance occurs because of \nshort-term pollution events, e.g. storm water overflows \n(EEA, 2019h). In instances in which bathing water \nquality is not adequately high, mitigation measures \nmay be required, such as the installation or upgrading \n\nof waste water treatment plants and sewage collection \nsystems. If bathing water in a certain location is found \nto be of poor quality during one season, bathing must \nbe prohibited at that location in the next season and \nmanagement measures have to be taken to improve \nwater quality. If bathing water is found to be of poor \nwater quality for 5 consecutive years, the bathing water \nsite has to be closed permanently.\n\nThe benefits of high-quality bathing water for health and \nwell-being\n\nThe maintenance of good bathing water quality is \nimportant not only because of the benefits for human \nhealth, but also because it may contribute to increased \nuse and demand for recreation activities in these \nlocations (Breen et al., 2017).\n\nBathing waters are important assets for local, regional \nand national economies. For example, a recent survey in \nScotland demonstrated that domestic visits to Scottish \nseaside locations generate an average of GBP\u00a0323\u00a0million \nin expenditure per annum (Visit Scotland, 2016). It has \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n95Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nbeen shown that, with improvements to bathing water \nquality, there are increases in welfare per trip (Hanley et \nal., 2003). In addition, in Ireland it was found that higher \nlevels of recreational demand (trips of longer duration) \noccur at bathing sites with better water quality (Breen \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). The inverse of this benefit should, however, \nalso be considered, as environmental impacts may \noccur from the use of bathing waters. For example, a \nrecent study demonstrated the effects that water-based \nrecreational activities may have on the integrity of \nfreshwater ecosystems (Venohr et al., 2018). Potential \nadverse impacts, such as the ecotoxicological effects of \nsunscreen, should be considered when establishing new \nbathing waters.\n\nAside from reducing the frequency of use of an \nindividual bathing site (Hanley et al., 2003), poor water \nquality is undesirable because of the negative impacts \nit may have on health. Pollution may arise from faecal \ncontamination due to farm waste, cesspits, septic tanks \nand poorly protected plumbing. Faecal contamination \ncan lead to intestinal illness and more severe illnesses, \nsuch as acute febrile respiratory illness (EEA, 2016d; \nKay\u00a0et al., 1994).\n\nAnother possible effect is eutrophication in bathing \nwaters. Nutrient enrichment may cause the excessive \ngrowth of plankton algae, which increases the \nconcentration of chlorophylla. This in turn may result \nin an increase in the frequency and duration of \nphytoplankton blooms and in hazards to human health \nin the case of toxic cyanobacteria (bluegreen algae) \n(EEA, 2012).\n\nBathing water quality across the Europe\n\nAcross Europe, there are 22\u00a0295 bathing water sites \nmonitored for their water quality. In 2019, 95\u00a0% of \nall sites met the minimum quality requirements set \nout in the EU's Bathing Water Directive, with 84.6\u00a0% \nachieving 'excellent' status. Only 1.3 % of EU bathing \nwater sites were rated as having poor water quality, \nand it is in these locations that the risk of human illness \nis highest. In general, coastal bathing water is of better \nquality than that of inland sites. In 2019, 87.4 %, of \ncoastal bathing sites were classified as of excellent \nquality compared to 79.1 % of inland sites in the EU \n(EEA,\u00a02020b).\n\nThere are differences in bathing water quality across \nEurope, as presented in Figure 4.11. All reported \nbathing water sites in Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, \nLuxembourg, Romania and Slovenia achieved at least \nsufficient quality in 2019. In five countries, 95 % or \nmore of bathing waters were assessed as being of \nexcellent quality: Cyprus (99.1 % of all sites), Austria \n\n(98.5 % of all sites), Malta (97.7 % of all sites), Greece \n(95.7 % of all sites) and Croatia (95.6 % of all sites) \n(EEA,\u00a02020b).\n\nIn six European countries, 3 % or more of bathing \nwaters were of poor quality: Albania (seven bathing \nwaters or 5.9 %), Estonia (three bathing waters or \n5.6\u00a0%), Hungary (10 bathing waters or 3.9 %), Ireland \n(five bathing waters or 3.4 %), the Netherlands \n(24\u00a0bathing waters or 3.3 %) and Slovakia (one bathing \nwater or 3.1\u00a0%) (EEA, 2020b).\n\n4.5.3 Drinking water quality and health\n\nDrinking water across the EU is regulated under the \nDrinking Water Directive. The directive applies to \ndrinking water from tankers, bottles or containers, the \nfood-processing industry and all distribution systems \nserving more than 50 people or supplying more than \n10\u00a0m3 per day (or less if the water is supplied as part \nof an economic activity). There is a distinction between \nlarge and small supplies of water; Member States \nare obliged to monitor large supplies but not small \nsupplies. Drinking water comes from groundwater \n(50\u00a0%) and surface water (36\u00a0%) across the EU \n(EC,\u00a02016b).\n\nUnder the directive, Member States must monitor the \nquality of the drinking water supplied to consumers \nacross a total of 47 parameters. These include \nmicrobiological, chemical and indicator parameters. \nSimilar to the Bathing Water Directive, the biological \nparameters are based on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and \nintestinal enterococci, which should in effect be entirely \nabsent from drinking water to guarantee its quality \nand safety. The chemicals monitored represent some \nof the most concerning chemicals that are relevant to \nhuman health, totalling 26 different parameters. These \ninclude pesticides, mercury, nitrate, cyanide, fluoride, \nacrylamide and arsenic. The indicator parameters \nserve to indicate a change in the water source or the \ntreatment or distribution of the water, and include \nparameters such as odour, colour, chloride, sulphate \nand turbidity.\n\nIn February 2018, the Commission published a \nproposal for a recast of the Drinking Water Directive. \nWhile an evaluation of the existing directive found it \nwas broadly fit for purpose, a number of updates and \nadditions were proposed for the recast directive. These \nincluded updating the standards (including adding \nnew substances), providing for a risk-based approach \nto monitoring to allow resources to be applied to \nthe highest risk areas, improving public access to \ninformation on drinking water, taking measures to \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n96 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nharmonise the standards for materials in contact with \ndrinking water and taking measures to improve overall \npublic access to drinking water (EC, 2018c).\n\nDrinking water quality across the EU\n\nThe provision of safe and clean drinking water is \ngenerally seen as a fundamental right for citizens \nand hence governments tend to prioritise a sufficient \nsupply of good-quality drinking water. In general, \ncompliance levels are high for larger water supplies, \nwhich serve the vast majority of EU citizens; between \n2011 and 2013, there was over 99\u00a0% compliance for \n\nmicrobiological and chemical parameters and more \nthan 98.5\u00a0% compliance for indicator parameters \n(EC, 2016b), as illustrated in Figure 4.12. Overall, the \nhighest number of exceedances related to E. coli \ncontamination. Of all the chemical parameters, arsenic \nwas shown to exhibit the lowest compliance rate \n(98.8\u00a0%). This slightly lower compliance rate was due to \nthe geological background concentration that can be \nfound in some countries.\n\nWithin the indicator parameter group, the greatest \nnumbers of exceedances were for total organic carbon \nand iron (EC, 2016b). Overall, no major differences \n\nSource:  EEA (2020b).\n\nFigure 4.11  Proportion of bathing water sites with excellent water quality in 2019\n\n21.6\n\n58.8\n62.5\n\n63.0\n\n65.3\n\n66.1\n\n70.6\n\n70.8\n\n72.8\n\n74.2\n\n76.0\n\n78.5\n\n79.5\n\n80.9\n81.0\n\n82.182.5\n84.8\n\n85.2\n\n86.4\n\n87.2\n\n88.4\n\n88.4\n\n88.4\n\n91.5\n\n92.5\n\n95.6\n\n95.7\n\n97.7\n\n98.5\n\n99.1\n\nPoland Albania\n\nSlovakia\n\nEstonia\n\nBulgaria\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLuxembourg\n\nHungary\n\nIreland\n\nNetherlands\n\nRomania\n\nSweden\n\nFrance\n\nSlovenia\n\nCzechia\nSwitzerlandLatvia\n\nEurope\n\nBelgium\n\nFinland\n\nLithuania \n\nDenmark \n\nItaly\n\nSpain \n\nPortugal\n\nGermany\n\nCroatia\n\nGreece\n\nMalta \n\nAustria\n\nCyprus\n\nBased on 2019 data (%)\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n97Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nbetween Member States were observed. These very \nhigh compliance rates highlight the success of the \nefforts that have been made at a European level to \nensure that drinking water is fit for purpose.\n\nWith respect to pesticides, there are specific limits \nto the quantities present in drinking water. In this \ninstance, the specific pesticides that are tested \ndepend on individual Member State use of pesticides \n(only pesticides likely to be present in a given supply \nneed to be tested). For reporting purposes, a list of \n13 pesticides was agreed between the European \nCommission and Member States. Based on data \nfrom 2011 to 2013 (EC, 2016b), monitoring rates for \npesticides were low (27.4\u00a0%), which does not allow a \ncomprehensive assessment of pesticide contamination \nin drinking water. However, a risk assessment carried \nout in France found that the contribution of tap water \nto dietary exposure to pesticides is generally low \n(ANSES, 2013b).\n\nApart from the larger public supplies regulated under \nthe Drinking Water Directive, the directive also includes \nrequirements for 'small supplies', which are defined \nas those that supply less than 1\u00a0000\u00a0m3 per day or \nless than 5\u00a0000 people. A 2009 European Commission \nreview of monitoring data for small supplies found \nthat monitoring data were generally limited and if \nthey were available they were not complete. Overall, \n\nthe compliance rate for small supplies was estimated \nat around 60\u00a0%, with respect to microbiological \nparameters (EC, 2016c). This is obviously significantly \nlower than the compliance rates for larger supplies. \nThis is particularly concerning, as in 2010 it was \nestimated that there were 85\u00a0000 small supplies in the \nEU providing drinking water to approximately 65 million \ncitizens (EC, 2016c).\n\nThere is less information readily available on private \nwells and the regulatory regime varies from country \nto country. For example, in Germany only 0.7\u00a0% of \nthe population is served by private wells; however, \nthese wells are still required to meet the minimum \nrequirements stipulated in the German Drinking Water \nOrdinance for small supplies (UBA, 2018). Conversely, \nin Ireland, approximately 11\u00a0% of the population is \nsupplied by private wells, which are effectively exempt \nfrom regulation. The onus is therefore on the owner \nof the well to carry out testing and satisfy themselves \nthat the water is fit for consumption (DHPLG, 2019). \nIt is estimated that 30\u00a0% of the 170\u00a0000 private \nwells in Ireland are contaminated with E.coli arising \nfrom human or animal waste (EPA, 2017). The Irish \nauthorities have also reported a growing number of \ncases of VTEC (verocytotoxigenic E. coli) \u2014 a pathogenic \nform of E. coli \u2014 and, while drinking water is not the \nonly potential source of exposure, an analysis of cases \nshows that patients suffering from VTEC are up to four \n\nSource:  EEA (2016d).\n\nFigure 4.12  Percentage compliance for the parameter groups \u2014 microbiological parameters, chemical \nparameters and indicator parameters \u2014 for the reporting period 2011-2013 in the EU\n\n97.0 0.0 97.5 98.0 98.5 99.0 99.5 100.0 \n\nMicrobiological parameters \n\nChemical parameters \n\nIndicator parameters \n\nCompliance with the directive (%)\n\n2011 2012 2013 \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n98 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ntimes more likely to have consumed untreated water \nfrom household wells (EPA, 2017). Ireland also has the \nhighest number of reported VTEC cases in Europe, with \n757 reported in 2015 (EPA, 2017). In Austria, about \n10\u00a0% of the population use private wells, and, as in \nIreland, there is no formal regulation of these wells \n(BMNT, 2018). Overall, data on the usage and quality \nof water from private wells in Europe are limited, but \navailable evidence suggests that they may be a cause \nfor concern.\n\nEmerging contaminants\n\nThe Drinking Water Directive requires the assessment \nof water quality based on a range of pollutants of \nconcern. However, there are other 'unregulated' \nchemicals found in drinking water that are also of \nconcern. For example, the presence of pollutants such \nas pharmaceuticals, brominated flame retardants, \nnanomaterials, chemicals present in sunscreens or \ndibutyl phthalates. The statement of the Scientific \nCommittee on Health, Environmental and Emerging \nRisks (Scheer) on emerging issues (Scheer, 2018) \nhighlighted the potential risk posed by polar organic \ncompounds, referred to as persistent mobile organic \nchemicals. These substances are very difficult to \nremove during water treatment activities and hence \nthere is the potential that their environmental \nconcentrations will increase over time as they circulate \nand become enriched in the water cycle, potentially \nentering the drinking water supply (Scheer, 2018). \nA\u00a0review of emerging contaminants by Villaneuva et\u00a0al. \n\n(2014) indicates that, while the risks posed by these \nchemicals individually may be low, there are concerns \nabout the risk of exposures to mixtures, while there \nis limited knowledge on the ability of drinking water \ntreatment plants to remove these pollutants. The \nstudy concluded that there is a particular knowledge \ngap and a need to evaluate human exposure and the \nrisks posed by a wide range of emerging contaminants. \nWee\u00a0and Aris (2017) also noted that the exposure of \nhumans to endocrine-disrupting chemicals through \ndrinking water is under-researched but may be an \nimportant route of exposure.\n\nBox 4.13 presents a case study on recent drinking \nwater contamination from an industrial source in the \nVeneto region of Italy.\n\nIn addition to emerging pollutants, trends such as \nincreasing levels of urbanisation, the intensification of \nfood production activities and the effects of climate \nchange are also likely to present significant challenges \nin terms of protecting drinking water supplies.\n\nAcknowledging the risk from emerging contaminants, \na recent revision of the Drinking Water Directive \nincludes limits for some additional pollutants, \nincluding limits for some perfluorinated compounds \n(EC, 2018c).\n\nAnother emerging concern is the contamination of \ndrinking water with plastic fibres (Tyree and Morrison, \n2017). It was found that 74\u00a0% of European samples \n\n \nBox 4.13   Responding to per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substance contamination of drinking water in the Veneto \n\nregion of Italy \n\nIn 2013, drinking water was found to be contaminated by per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) in an area of the \nVeneto region, Italy, by the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection and Prevention (ARPAV). Emissions of fluorinated \nchemicals from a local manufacturing company had contaminated groundwater, surface water and drinking water. PFASs \nhave negative health impacts, including pregnancy complications, thyroid disease, high cholesterol and cancer (EEA, 2019i).\n\nIn response, the Italian National Health Institute defined maximum levels of PFASs in drinking water, which were then \nextended to cover water for livestock and agriculture. Carbon filters were installed to remove PFASs from drinking \nwater in the area, and PFAS concentrations were monitored in drinking water, groundwater, surface water, soil, air \nand food, and in the exposed population. A retrospective health impact assessment approach was used to identify \nmitigation and remediation measures, and inform risk communication and future monitoring and epidemiological studies \n(WHO Europe,\u00a02017c).\n\nDuring a follow-up, a study assessed mortality rates for adverse health outcomes possibly associated with PFAS exposure \nand found higher mortality rates in contaminated areas where these levels were exceeded than in uncontaminated areas. \nHigher risks were detected for general mortality, kidney and breast cancers, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, myocardial \ninfarction, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Mastrantonio et al., 2017).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n99Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ntested positive for plastic. A separate study in Ireland \nhighlighted the lack of knowledge regarding pathways \ninto freshwater, exposure rates and health impacts \n(Mahon et al., 2014). Box 4.14 provides an overview of \nthe issues related to microplastics.\n\nHealth impacts of poor-quality drinking water\n\nTo an even greater extent than bathing water, the \npresence of microbiological parameters in drinking \nwater has the potential to cause health implications, \nmostly as a result of intestinal illness. It is difficult to \napproximate the true disease burden across Europe, \nbut it is likely to be underestimated (WHO Europe, \n2016b). Importantly, with climate change increasing \nthe number of heavy precipitation events, droughts \nand flooding events across Europe, there is potential \nfor water-borne outbreaks of diseases to increase \n(Brown and Murray, 2013). Recently, there have been \noutbreaks of Cryptosporidium across much of Europe, \n\nwhich is a significant cause of diarrhoeal disease \n(Caccio and Chalmers, 2016). These are often significant \npublic health events; for example, during the period \n2010-2011 in Sweden, there were two outbreaks that \naffected an estimated 47\u00a0000 people (Rehn et al., 2015).\n\nLocalised lead contamination of drinking water \nmay also still be a problem in some European \ncountries. A study in 2009 estimated that 25\u00a0% of \ndomestic dwellings in the EU had lead pipes as part \nof their water supply system, potentially having an \nimpact on 120 million people (Hayes and Skubala, \n2009). Nonetheless, European monitoring data on \nlead in drinking water do not indicate a significant \ncompliance issue.\n\nThe presence of chemicals in drinking water also \nhas the potential to affect human health; the health \nimpact of chemicals is addressed in more detail in \nSection 4.6.\n\n \nBox 4.14  Microplastics\n\nPlastics are an intrinsic part of modern life. In the EU, the annual demand for plastics is estimated at around 49 million \ntonnes, while nearly 26 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated annually, with less than 30\u00a0% of this being sent for \nrecycling). The risks posed by plastics and the need to address concerns around the way plastics are produced, used and \ndiscarded has been recognised through the adoption of the first 'European strategy for plastics in a circular economy' \n(EC,\u00a02018d).\n\nWithin the strategy, the issue of microplastics (plastic particles less than 5\u00a0mm in size) is also addressed, with estimates of \nbetween 75\u00a0000 and 300\u00a0000 tonnes of microplastics being released into the environment in Europe every year. A study of \nthe Danube river by the Austrian Environment Agency (UBA) identified the loading of microplastics in the river at between \n6\u00a0and 66\u00a0kg per day, with the overall annual loading estimated at up to 17 tonnes. Only 10\u00a0% of the plastics were identified \nas being definitely from industrial activities, with the remainder being from other diffuse sources. These sources include \nrun-off from roads, litter, construction activities and cosmetics (ICPDR, 2016). \n\nApart from the potential risks posed by the presence of plastics in drinking water, their small size means they can easily be \ningested by marine animals and can thus find their way into the human food chain as well as have an impact on the health \nof the animals themselves. One particular area of concern is the intentional use of microplastics in personal care products, \nsuch as exfoliates, with a number of EU Member States already placing restrictions on their use. The European Chemicals \nAgency has investigated the risk posed by the intentional use of microplastics in products and has recently proposed \nan EU-wide restriction, which, if enacted, would prevent the release of up to 400\u00a0000 tonnes of microplastics into the \nenvironment over the next 20 years (ECHA, 2019).\n\nTo date, the assessment of the impact of plastics has focused on ecosystem impacts rather than on human impacts, with \nlimited evidence available in relation to the impacts on humans (Toussaint et al., 2019) and on the levels of microplastics \npresent in drinking water (WHO, 2019b). Nonetheless, an initial review by the World Health Organization concludes \nthat there is no reliable information available to suggest that microplastics in drinking water are currently a concern \n(WHO, 2019b). A report from the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM) Group of Chief Scientific Advisors summarises the \nenvironmental and health risks of microplastics by stating that, although the evidence currently available suggests that \nmicroplastic pollution at present does not pose a widespread risk to humans or the environment, there are significant \ngrounds for concern and for precautionary measures to be taken. High-quality risk assessment approaches are essential \nto\u00a0prioritise such measures and to determine when and where to apply them (Group of Chief Scientific Advisors, 2019).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n100 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.15  Citizens' initiative on access to drinking water \n\nThe European Citizens' Initiative allows citizens to call on the European Commission to propose legislation on matters of \nEU competence when there are greater than 1 million signatories.\n\n'Right2Water' was an initiative that was submitted to the Commission by its organisers on 20\u00a0December 2013 and that \nreceived support from over 1.6 million citizens (Right2Water, 2019). The Right2Water initiative was launched to ensure that \nwater remains a public service and a public good, with proposals including using 'Human Right to Water and Sanitation' in all \ncommunications on water and/or sanitation, to guarantee water and sanitation services to all EU citizens and to prevent its \nliberalisation.\n\nThe Commission responded positively to this initiative, which included launching an EU-wide public consultation on the \nDrinking Water Directive. Furthermore, as part of its resolution of 8\u00a0September 2015 on the follow-up, the European \nParliament recognised that water is not a commodity but a public good and one that it is vital to human life.\n\nThe Commission proposal for a revised Drinking Water Directive (EC, 2018c), expected to enter into force in 2020 subject to \nformal approval, came in direct follow up to the Right2Water European Citizens' Initiative. \n\nDisparities in the availability of clean drinking water\n\nDespite the fact that monitoring is good across the \nEU and that compliance regarding pollutants in drinking \nwater is high, there are areas of Europe in which access \nto clean drinking water is not comprehensive. In a recent \nWHO Europe report, an assessment of small-scale \nrural water supplies in Serbia found that only 37\u00a0% of \npiped systems (serving up to 10\u00a0000 people) and 17\u00a0% \nof individual supplies (serving less than five households \nor 20 inhabitants) complied with the national standards \nfor microbiological and physico-chemical parameters \n(WHO Europe, 2017d). This is despite the fact that, \nin 2016, Serbian urban water supply systems had \ncompliance rates of over 90\u00a0% for physico-chemical and \nmicrobiological parameters.\n\nThere are disparities in access to safe drinking water \nalong ethnic lines in Europe. The Roma are the largest \nethnic minority in the EU, and in 2016 the European \nUnion Agency for Fundamental Rights found that \nacross nine European countries (15), an average of \n30 % of Roma live in households with no tap water. \nConsiderable variation was seen across countries, \nwith less than one in ten Roma living in households \nwithout a tap in Spain (2 %), Czechia (2 %) and Greece \n(9 %), and higher proportions seen in Portugal (14\u00a0%), \nBulgaria (23 %), Slovakia (27 %), Croatia (34 %), \nHungary (33 %) and Romania (68 %) (European Union \nAgency for Fundamental Rights, 2016). A 2017 study \ninvestigated access to safe and affordable drinking \nwater at 93 Roma sites in seven countries, including \nAlbania, France, Hungary, North Macedonia, Moldova, \nMontenegro, and Slovakia, and found that at 81 % of \nthe sites, Romani households were not connected to \nthe water mains (European Roma Rights Centre, 2017).\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers in Europe also suffer \nlimited access to drinking water, with specific concerns \nat Europe's formal and informal refugee camps. For \nexample, prior to the demolition in 2016 of Europe's \nlargest formal refugee camp on the outskirts of Calais, \nthe 'Jungle' or Camp de la Lande, a population of \n3\u00a0000 had access to five piped water taps. Residents \nused containers previously used to contain hazardous \nchemicals to transport and store water, with containers \nfound to be contaminated with harmful bacteria (Dhesi \net al., 2018). Following the dismantling of the Jungle, \npeople continue to live in informal camps, with efforts \nnow underway to move people into accommodation \ncentres. There is currently an urgent need to improve \naccess to water at reception centres on the Aegean \nIslands in Greece (United Nations High Commission for \nRefugees, 2020). \n\nThe section above on drinking water quality in the EU \nalso highlights the fact that people served by small \nsupplies and private wells are likely to be at greater \nrisk than those served by larger supplies. The recast \nof the Drinking Water Directive seeks to address this \ndisparity in the availability of clean drinking water. \nThe European Citizens' Initiative on access to drinking \nwater, 'Right2Water', is described in Box 4.15. \n\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \n(UNECE) Protocol on Water and Health also focuses \non addressing inequities in access to safe drinking \nwater (UNECE, 1999), and in addition supports work \ntowards the achievement of Sustainable Development \nGoal\u00a06: 'ensure availability and sustainable \nmanagement of water and sanitation for all'. A \nnumber of EU Member States are signatories to this \nlegally binding protocol.\n\n(15) Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Romania.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n101Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nChemical safety is a matter of public concern, with one \nin four EU citizens 'very concerned' about exposure to \nchemicals in their daily lives (EC, 2017c). Understanding \nthe risks posed by chemicals requires evidence on the \ntwo dimensions of chemical risk \u2014 hazard and exposure \n\u2014 as explained in Box 4.16.\n\nThe volume and diversity of chemicals produced and \nconsumed grew substantially over the past century and \ncontinues to increase (CEFIC, 2018). Of the 314\u00a0million \ntonnes of chemicals consumed in the EU in 2018, 71\u00a0% \nwere classified as hazardous to health (Eurostat, 2020e). \nIn terms of diversity, 22 920 unique substances had \nbeen registered under the Registration, Evaluation, \nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) \nRegulation (EU, 2006b) by July 2020. \n\nThis figure does not capture pharmaceuticals and \npesticides (although raw material chemical inputs will be \ncaptured) or chemicals on the market at low tonnage (i.e. \n<\u00a01 tonne). Once emitted into the environment, chemicals \ndegrade into an unknown number of metabolites.\n\nPeople are exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals \nin their daily lives by breathing in polluted air and dust, \nconsuming contaminated food and drink and coming into \ncontact with consumer goods (see Figure 4.13). A foetus \ncan be exposed in the womb to chemicals in the body \nof the mother that cross the placental barriers, while \nbabies can be exposed via their mother's breast milk. \nThe chemical body burden results from combined daily \n\nchemical exposures as well as persistent chemicals that \nentered the body during past exposures and accumulate \nin tissues. Substances include synthetic chemicals, such \nas industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and \nbiocides, chemical pollutants unintentionally emitted \nfrom industrial processes and combustion, and chemicals \nthat occur naturally in the environment.\n\nCurrent efforts to establish a circular economy to \nreduce the impacts of production and consumption \nmay generate new risks in terms of chemical exposure \nvia consumer products. The recycling of products \nthat contain hazardous chemicals can contaminate \nmaterial flows \u2014 an example being recycled plastics \ncontaining brominated flame retardants. Some of the \npotential risks associated with a circular economy are \nmore likely to have an impact on vulnerable groups, \nfor example workers in the waste management sector \n(WHO\u00a0Europe, 2018). Decisions on how to move forward \nrequire reflection on the optimal balance between \nremoving hazardous materials from circulation and \nmaximising resource efficiency for each material flow. \nThe consideration of unintended adverse effects is an \nimportant part of the development of relevant policies.\n\nAt the same time, there are opportunities to \npursue circularity in chemical flows, for example \nthrough closed-loop mechanical recycling of plastics \n(Stenmarck et al., 2017). Another opportunity is the \nextraction of hazardous chemicals from chemical waste \nstreams and their recycling.\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Exposure to hazardous chemicals contributes to the burden of disease in Europe, with certain chemicals associated \nwith chronic diseases, neurological disorders and developmental effects in unborn children.\n\n\u2022 At global level, 2.7 % of the burden of disease and 1.7 % of total deaths are attributed to chemicals.\n\n\u2022 Human exposure to well-known hazardous substances has decreased in Europe as a result of policy measures. At the \nsame time, the volume and diversity of chemicals flowing through production and consumption systems continues to \nincrease.\n\n\u2022 The total burden of chemicals on human health is not known. There are gaps in knowledge regarding hazards and \ncurrent exposure levels of the European population to chemicals are also unknown. The impacts of exposure to \nendocrine disruptors and chemical mixtures are not well understood.\n\n\u2022 Children and pregnant women are more sensitive to the adverse effects of chemicals, with exposure to certain \nhazardous chemicals associated with developmental effects.\n\n\u2022 Early evidence suggests that social status is a driver of human exposure to chemicals, with exposure patterns \ninfluenced by behaviours such as consumer choices, dietary preferences and smoking. \n\n4.6 Chemicals and health\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n102 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.16  The dimensions of chemical risk \u2014 hazard and exposure\n\nThe risk of harm from any chemical results from a combination of the hazard associated with the chemical and the level of \nexposure to the chemical. \n\nHazard refers to the properties of a chemical that make it toxic, meaning it can cause harm to human health.\n\nExposure describes the amount of a chemical that an individual comes into contact with, as well as the frequency of contact. \nThe duration of exposure is also a significant factor in assessing the risk posed by a chemical.\n\nSource:  EEA (2019a).\n\nFigure 4.13  Sources of chemicals and exposure routes for humans\n\n20:20\n\nEcosphere\nTechnosphere\nHome\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n103Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nAn overview of EU chemical policies is provided in \nBox\u00a04.17.\n\n4.6.1 Health impacts of chemicals\n\nThe human health impacts of chemicals are considerable. \nThe World Health Organization estimates that 2.7 % \nof the total disease burden and 1.7 % of total deaths \nwere attributed to chemicals globally in 2016 (WHO, \n2018c). The scope of this estimation was confined to a \nsmall number of chemicals for which causality is well \ndescribed. The health impacts of chemicals are thought \nto be underestimated because of the challenges of \nunderstanding exposure to chemicals over a lifetime \nand associating this exposure with disease outcomes \nto establish causality. Exposure to hazardous chemicals \nis known to be associated with a wide range of serious \nhealth impacts, including chronic diseases, neurological \ndisorders and developmental effects in unborn children \n(Pr\u00fcss-Ust\u00fcn et al., 2011). \n\nIn terms of translating health costs into economic terms, \nan assessment of the economic costs of adverse effects \n\non human brain development resulting from exposure \nto just four types of neurotoxicants\u00a0(16) estimated \ncosts greater than 2.5\u00a0% of global GDP (Grandjean and \nBellanger, 2017). Most recently, the annual health-related \ncosts in the EU associated with the group of PFASs were \nestimated at EUR\u00a052-84 billion for all countries in the \nEuropean Economic Area\u00a0(Goldenman et al., 2019).\n\nThe EU has the most comprehensive and advanced \nchemicals legislation in the world, spearheaded by the \nREACH Regulation. Under REACH, the understanding \nof which substances are produced and used in the \nEU\u00a0and the associated risks has improved dramatically. \nNevertheless, the quality of information on chemical risks \nreported by industry is often poor, with 32\u00a0% of dossiers \nfor the highest tonnage rate (1\u00a0000 tonne per year and \nabove) found to be non-compliant with information \nrequirements (BFR, 2018). In addition, information on \nlong-term impacts is lacking, and an estimate of the \noverall impact of chemicals on human health is not \npossible. Efforts are under way to prioritise substances \nof potential concern and evaluate the potential risks, with \nthe aim of identifying those substances that should be \nsubject to controls (ECHA, 2018a).\n\n \nBox 4.17  EU chemical policies \n\nThe EU has a large body of policies regulating chemicals. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \n(REACH) Regulation (EU, 2006b) is the key horizontal legislation that aims to protect human health and the environment. \nThe REACH Regulation obliges companies to provide information on the properties and hazards of the chemicals that they \nmanufacture and market in the EU in registration dossiers, as well as manage the associated risks. The regulation also calls for \nthe progressive substitution of the most hazardous chemicals, when economically and technically suitable alternatives have \nbeen identified. This is done by enforcing restrictions on their uses or by authorising the chemical uses for defined purposes.\n\nThe Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation (EU, 2008b) protects human health and the environment by \nputting in place rules for the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals and ensuring that information about hazards is \ncommunicated down the supply chain.\n\nRegarding chemical products, the EU has a comprehensive body of legislation to regulate chemicals in detergents, biocides, plant \nprotection products and pharmaceuticals. Policies limit the use and presence of hazardous chemicals in consumer products, \nto ensure consumer safety and protect the environment from diffuse emissions, including personal care products, cosmetics, \ntextiles, electronic equipment and food contact materials. Limits are also in place for chemicals in food and drinking water.\n\nEuropean policies for environmental quality set maximum thresholds for the presence of certain chemicals in air and water \nbodies. Legislation addresses point source emissions from industrial installations and from urban waste water treatment plants. \nEmissions of chemicals that are hazardous and of global concern because of the transboundary nature of their impacts, such as \npersistent organic pollutants and mercury, are also regulated. \n\nThe European Green Deal foresees actions to protect human health from chemicals. Both the Farm to Fork Strategy (EC, 2020b) \nand the Biodiversity Strategy (EC, 2020c) aim to halve the use and risk of pesticides by 2050, and to halve the use of more \nhazardous pesticides by 2030. The Circular Economy Action Plan recognises the potential risks of contaminated secondary \nmaterial flows, and foresees measures to improve the tracking and management of hazardous chemicals in material flows, and \nto support the development of methods to remove contaminants from waste (EC, 2020e). In late 2020, the Commission will \npresent a chemicals strategy for sustainability, to better protect health and the environment and to encourage innovation for \nsafe and sustainable alternatives. An alignment of policies with the latest scientific evidence on endocrine disruptors, hazardous \nchemicals in products, chemical mixtures and very persistent chemicals is foreseen (EC, 2019a).\n\n(16) The four types of neurotoxicant included in the study are lead, methylmercury, PBDEs and organophosphate pesticides.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n104 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nCurrent concerns related to unknowns include the \nhealth effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals \u2014 often \nat low doses (see Box 4.18) \u2014 the effects of mixtures \nof chemicals (see Box 4.19) and the health impacts of \nexposure to pesticides (see Box 4.20). In addition, as new \nsubstances come onto the market, evidence regarding \nhazards and exposure for assessing risk is generally \nlimited or lacking. Such emerging substances may initially \nbe used at low tonnage bands, for which information \nrequirements for registration under REACH are low. In \nseveral cases, chemicals known to be hazardous have \nbeen substituted by new alternative substances with a \nsimilar chemical structure but for which toxicity data are \nnot available. Several of these alternative substances \nhave later been found to exhibit similar toxicities, \nan outcome known as 'regrettable substitution'. The \nEuropean Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has a substitution \nstrategy in place to support informed and meaningful \nsubstitution of chemicals of concern in the EU and \nboost the availability and adoption of safer alternative \nsubstances\u00a0and technologies (ECHA, 2018b).\n\n4.6.2 Sensitivity of vulnerable groups\n\nCertain demographic groups are more vulnerable to \nthe toxic effects of chemicals, including children and \npregnant women.\n\nExposure to various chemicals, including lead, \nmercury, flame retardants, plasticisers and \nother endocrine-disrupting chemicals, in early \nchildhood has been associated with a range of \nneurodevelopmental effects. Exposure to certain \nsolvents or pesticides in early life may induce \nParkinson's disease in later life (WHO, 2016e). \nTesticular cancer in men and breast cancer in women \nare suspected to be linked to early-life\u00a0or prenatal \nexposures (Grandjean et al., 2008). Young children are \nmore exposed to chemicals because of their proximity \nto house dust when crawling, their increased \nbreathing rate, their hand-to-mouth behaviour and \ntheir higher consumption of water and food relative \nto their size, in particular fruit and vegetables.\n\n \nBox 4.18  Health impacts of exposure to endocrine disruptors\n\nEndocrine disruptors are chemicals that may interfere with the normal functioning of the body's hormone system. This can \nresult in impacts on development, fertility and the neurological and immune systems. Approximately 800 chemicals are \nknown or suspected to be endocrine disruptors, with many present in everyday products, such as metal food cans, plastic \nconsumer products, pesticides, food and cosmetics.\n\nHumans are the most sensitive to the health effects of endocrine disruption when in utero, early childhood and puberty \n(WHO and UNEP, 2013). There is evidence that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals plays a causal role in a range of \nhealth outcomes, including a decrease in IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and associated intellectual disability, autism, attention \ndeficit hyperactivity disorder, childhood obesity, adult obesity, adult diabetes, cryptorchidism, male infertility and mortality \nassociated with reduced testosterone. The disease and dysfunction caused by exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals \nhave been estimated to cause EUR\u00a0157 billion in annual healthcare costs and lost earnings within the EU (Trasande \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).\n\nIn 2018, the Commission published a communication entitled 'Towards a comprehensive European Union framework on \nendocrine disruptors', setting out a strategy to address the health effects of endocrine disruptors, as well as efforts to build \nknowledge (EC, 2018e).\n\n \nBox 4.19  Health impacts of exposure to mixtures of chemicals\n\nWhile the current approach to chemical risk assessment is based on single substances, the reality is that people are exposed \nto a mixture of chemicals in their daily lives. Chemicals that have an impact on the human body in a similar way can act \njointly to produce a combination of effects that are larger than the effects of a single chemical (EC, 2011a). Combined \nexposure to a mixture of chemicals can lead to health effects, even if single substances in the mixture do not exceed \nsafe\u00a0levels.\n\nThis presents a challenge, since chemicals are predominately regulated by establishing safe thresholds for single substances \n(JRC, 2017). Recognising this, the Commission implemented a programme of work on chemical mixtures (EC, 2012a). Efforts \nare under way to develop methods for risk assessments for mixtures of chemicals (Bopp, et al., 2018), and there have been \nearly discussions of proposals to lower safety limits for single chemicals through a mixture assessment factor to account \nfor combined effects (Kortenkamp and Faust, 2018). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published guidance on \nmethodologies for combined chemical risk assessment (EFSA, 2019a). \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n105Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nRegarding pregnant women, exposure to certain \npesticides and phthalates has been linked to reductions \nin placental weight and premature birth. Foetuses \nare extremely vulnerable because of the sensitivity \nof the chemical signalling that steers early human \ndevelopment and the potential for disruption when \nexposed to chemicals. Congenital malformations have \nbeen linked to chemical exposure, including congenital \nheart disease linked to exposure to pesticides and \norganic solvents, cryptorchidism and hypospadias \nlinked to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and urinary \nmalformations linked to pesticides (WHO, 2016e).\n\nThe elderly may be more vulnerable, as the \nphysiological processes that metabolise and eliminate \nchemicals become less effective as a result of ageing. \nHowever, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the \neffects of chemical exposure in ageing populations \n(Risher et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010).\n\n4.6.3 Social status and exposure to hazardous \nchemicals in Europe\n\nHuman biomonitoring provides a tool for understanding \nthe chemical burden on the body and exploring \ntrends in exposure over time and across social and \ndemographic groups (see Box\u00a04.21). There is evidence \n\nfrom human biomonitoring studies that social status \nis a driver of human exposure to chemicals, with \nexposure patterns influenced by behaviours such as \nproduct use, dietary preferences and smoking, as well \nas housing quality. However, the patterns of inequalities \nin exposure differ depending on the chemical. The \navailable evidence from individual countries is \nconsidered below, complemented by the results of an \nanalysis of the influence of education levels on exposure \nin 17\u00a0European countries.\n\nEvidence of the influence of social status on chemical \nexposure from various countries\n\nStudies from several European countries have found \ndimensions of social deprivation to be associated with \nhigher levels of exposure to certain chemicals. A\u00a0German \nstudy found that household chemicals that can have \nan impact on health, such as certain disinfectants, \nindoor sprays and detergents, were more frequently \nused by households of low social status (Seiwert et al., \n2008). Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) was found to be \nassociated with low socio-economic status in Spain \n(Casas et al., 2011) and Belgium (Geens\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). \nPossible drivers include exposure to tobacco smoke, as \ncigarette filters contain a small amount of BPA, and the \nconsumption of canned food, as BPA is present in the \nepoxy resin lining of cans.\n\n \nBox 4.20  Human exposure to pesticides\n\nFor the general population, exposure to pesticides occurs through the consumption of food containing pesticide residues. A \nhigh intake of fruit and vegetables is positively correlated with a higher body burden of pesticides, while frequent consumption \nof organic products is associated with a lower pesticide burden (Berman et al., 2016). Children have a higher food intake per \nkilogram of body weight, leading to higher exposure levels. Domestic pesticide use and living in the vicinity of crops treated \nwith pesticides can also lead to exposure (Dereumeaux et al., 2018). As a result of the neurotoxic and endocrine-disrupting \nproperties of some pesticides, pregnant women and children are considered the most vulnerable population groups.\n\nThe EU regulates pesticides under the Regulation on Plant Protection Products (EU, 2009a) and sets safe limits for pesticide \nresidues in food and feed (EU, 2005). The latest monitoring information from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) \nfound 96\u00a0% of food samples collected across the EU in 2017 to be within legal limits, with just over 54\u00a0% free of quantifiable \nresidues (EFSA, 2019b). EFSA has also developed methodologies to carry out assessments of the risks posed to humans \nby residues of multiple pesticides in food. The first step was the establishment of cumulative assessment groups of \npesticides on the basis of their toxicological profile (EFSA, 2019c). A second step involved piloting the approach through two \nassessments of the cumulative risks of pesticides for the nervous systems and the thyroid.\n\nNevertheless, there is considerable public concern regarding the health impacts of pesticides in the EU, as evidenced by the \nEuropean Citizens' Initiative to 'ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic chemicals' (EU, 2017). \nEfforts are currently under way to better understand human exposure to pesticides of concern through coordinated human \nbiomonitoring under the Horizon 2020 project HBM4EU\u00a0(a).\n\nIn terms of effects on ecosystem services that support health, neonicotinoids pose risks to wild bees and honeybees, \nimportant pollinators supporting food production (EFSA, 2018).\n\nNote:  (a) www.HBM4EU.eu\n\nhttp://www.HBM4EU.eu\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n106 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nExposure to lead and cadmium has been associated \nwith low socio-economic status in Belgium (Morrens et \nal., 2012) and Spain (Llop et al., 2011). Exposure may \noccur from lead-based paints or lead plumbing in older \nhouses. Possible underlying factors for cadmium include \ndiet and exposure to tobacco smoke, since cadmium is \npresent in tobacco leaves. Even in women that smoke, \nthe consumption of offal contaminated with cadmium \ncan be an important contributor to the cadmium body \nburden (Berglund et al., 2015). Iron deficiency due to \nan unbalanced food pattern in groups with low social \nstatus may enhance the uptake of heavy metals such as \ncadmium (Kim et al., 2015). Living in an industrial hotspot \n(Wilhelm et al., 2005) and in older houses (Shiue and \nBramley, 2015) can also drive differences in cadmium \nexposure by social status. In the Vitebro province, Italy, \npopulations were found to be exposed to arsenic via \ndrinking water, with higher arsenic exposure associated \nwith low socio-economic status. This exposure was, in \nturn, associated with several diseases, including lung \ncancer, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes \n(D'Ippoliti\u00a0et al., 2015).\n\nPeople with lower social status in terms of either income \nor education were found to have higher concentrations \nof certain phthalate metabolites in Belgium (Geens et al., \n2014), the Netherlands (Ye\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008) and Spain (Valvi et \nal., 2015). In Sweden, phthalate exposure in mothers and \nchildren was associated with the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) \ncovering of floors and walls, with higher concentrations \nseen in less educated groups (Larsson et al. 2010). \nChildren with PVC floorings in their bedroom were more \nlikely to develop doctor-diagnosed asthma because of \nexposure via indoor dust (Shu et al., 2014). Other studies \nhave found the social gradients for phthalates exposure \nto vary depending on the substance.\n\nHowever, people of higher social status have also \nbeen found to have higher body burdens of certain \nchemicals. Raised concentrations of PFASs have been \n\nfound in people of higher socio-economic status. \nThis is linked to consuming food that has been \ncontaminated via environmental sources or food \ncontact materials and may also be influenced by \nthe use of textiles and sport equipment containing \nPFASs. A recent study of mother-child pairs in six \nEuropean countries found that higher socio-economic \nposition was associated with higher concentrations of \nseveral chemicals during pregnancy and in children, \nincluding certain PFASs, mercury, arsenic, several \nphenols and organophosphate pesticides. Conversely, \ncadmium exposure during pregnancy and exposure \nto lead and phthalate metabolites in childhood \nwere lower in this group (Montarezi et al., 2019). \nIncreased concentrations of mercury and arsenic \nwere found in individuals of higher socio-economic \nstatus in Austria\u00a0(Gundacker et al., 2006), Ireland \n(Cullen et al., 2014) and Spain (Ramon\u00a0et al., 2011). \nThe consumption of large predatory fish and shellfish \nis associated with a higher mercury body burden \n(Casta\u00f1o et al., 2015), with people of higher social \nstatus tending to consume more fish.\n\nThere is also some evidence from case studies that \nliving close to industrial installations can result in \nexposure to chemical emissions. Residential location \nis linked to socio-economic status, with housing in \nproximity to industrial sites tending to be cheaper. \nA German study found higher blood levels of lead \nand cadmium among children living in the vicinity \nof metal refineries in North Rhine Westphalia \n(Wilhelm et al., 2005). A recent study estimated the \nhealth impacts 1 544 waste landfill sites on local \npopulations across Europe and estimated that a \ntotal of 61 325 DALYs annually were associated with \nhealth outcomes including low birth weight (10 192 \nDALYs), congenital anomalies (958 DALYs), respiratory \ndiseases (2 688\u00a0DALYs), and annoyance from odour \n(47 505 DALYs) (Shaddick et al., 2019). The case study \npresented in Section\u00a04.5 describes drinking water \ncontamination in Italy resulting from hotspot pollution.\n\n \nBox 4.21 Human biomonitoring to understand exposure\n\nHuman biomonitoring measures the concentrations of chemicals or their metabolites in human urine, blood, hair or tissue. \nIt enables an assessment of human exposure to single chemicals or chemical mixtures resulting from the sum of chemicals \nthat have entered the body via various external exposure pathways. It can be used to assess trends in human exposure to \nchemicals over time, allowing researchers to understand how risk management measures, such as restrictions, influence \nexposure.\n\nUnder the European human biomonitoring initiative, HBM4EU\u00a0(a), efforts are under way to generate robust and coherent \ndata sets on the exposure of the European population to chemicals of concern. This includes producing exposure data on \n16 substance groups, mixtures of chemicals and emerging chemicals, as well as exploring exposure pathways and linking \nexposure to health effects.\n\nNote:  (a) www.HBM4EU.eu\n\nhttp://www.HBM4EU.eu\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n107Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nLevel of education as a factor in exposure to chemicals \nacross 17 countries\n\nThe Democophes project monitored chemicals in \n1\u00a0844 children and 1\u00a0844 mothers from 17 European \ncountries (Den Hond et al., 2015). For this report, \ndata from the Democophes project were analysed to \nassess how level of education influences exposure to \nmercury, cadmium and phthalates. The difference in \nchemical body burden was stratified by the highest \neducation level in the family, building on the analysis \nundertaken by Den Hond et al. (2015). Stratification \n\nfor socio-economic status at the country level results \nin small groups, meaning that results must be \ninterpreted with caution. Nevertheless, consistent \ntrends were observed across participating countries.\n\nFigure 4.14 presents the average concentrations \nfor a number of substances in mothers across all \n17\u00a0countries, by education level.

Some phthalates are used as coatings on pharmaceuticals, herbal \npreparations and nutritional supplements.\n\nIn terms of health effects, certain phthalates\u00a0(a) are classified as toxic to reproduction, meaning that they may damage \nhuman fertility and cause harm to an unborn child. In addition, some phthalates\u00a0(b) are known to be endocrine disruptors. \nEpidemiological studies have associated exposure to certain phthalates with obesity, insulin resistance, asthma, early \nonset of puberty, attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mixtures of phthalates with similar \nproperties can be more toxic than each individual chemical in isolation.\n\nHumans are exposed to phthalates through the consumption of foods and drinks held in containers containing phthalates. \nChildren can be exposed by sucking on plastic toys or products that contain phthalates. Another potential exposure route is \nindoor dust contaminated with phthalates released from plastic products or PVC furnishings.\n\nRisk management measures are in place across the EU to minimise exposure to phthalates known to be hazardous to \nhealth.\n\n\u2022 Several phthalates (di-2-ethyhexyl phthalate, DEHP; benzyl butyl phthalate, BBzP; diisobutyl phthalate, DiBP; and \ndi-n-butyl phthalate, DnBP) cannot be used in the EU without authorisation for specific uses.\n\n\u2022 DEHP, DnBP, DiBP and BBzP are banned in all toys and childcare articles, while diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl \nphthalate (DIDP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) are banned in toys and childcare articles that can be placed in the \nmouth.\n\n\u2022 The use of phthalates classified as toxic to reproduction is prohibited in cosmetics, apart from in exceptional cases.\n\n\u2022 The EU is currently setting legal limits for the concentration of certain phthalates (DEHP, BBzP and DnBP) in materials \nintended to come into contact with food.\n\n\u2022 The use of diisopentyl phthalate (DiPeP), di-n-pentyl phthalate (DnPeP), isopentyl-n-pentyl phthalate (PIPP) and \ndi(methoxyethyl) phthalate (DMEP) is banned in consumer products on the EU market. \n\nEfforts are under way to further restrict the use of certain phthalates in the EU. However, older products and furnishings \nin people's homes and workplaces may contain phthalates that are now banned. Phthalates with hazardous properties are \ntherefore still present in our everyday environment.\n\nNotes:   (a)  The following phthalates have been classified in the EU as toxic for reproduction: DEHP; benzyl butyl phthalate, BBzP; di-n-butyl \nphthalate, DnBP; diisobutyl phthalate, DiBP; dicyclohexyl phthalate, DCHP; di-n-pentyl phthalate; diisopentyl phthalate, DiPeP; \ndi(methoxyethyl) phthalate, DMEP; isopentyl-n-pentyl phthalate, PIPP; di-n-hexyl phthalate, DnHP; 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid \ndipentyl ester, branched and linear.\n\n   (b) The following phthalates have been classified in the EU as endocrine-disrupting compounds: DEHP, BBzP, DnBP, DiBP and DCHP.\n\nFocusing on the individual chemicals allows us to \nexplore some of the social drivers behind exposure. \nFor phthalates (see Box 4.22), the results of the \nanalysis by educational status vary across countries \nand the phthalate studied. MEHP, a metabolite of \nDEHP\u00a0(19), was consistently higher in mothers from \nfamilies with lower educational levels, with the sole \nexception of Spain. Likewise, higher internal exposure \n\nto the diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) metabolite \nMiBP\u00a0was seen in less educated mothers in five of the \nnine participating countries, as shown in Figure 4.15. \nDiBP\u00a0is a phthalate used in paint, lacquers, varnishes, \npaper, adhesives, paper and packaging for food and \nbottled water. For other phthalates, associations \nbetween exposure and levels of education were \nless\u00a0consistent.\n\n(19) Di-2-ethyhexyl phthalate.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n109Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nSources:  Data from Democophes country-specific statistical analysis reports.\n\nFigure 4.15  Concentrations of the DiBP metabolite MiBP in the urine of mothers, 2011-2012\n\nGermanyPortugalPoland Cyprus SpainIrelandBelgium Romania Switzerland\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nMiBP (Monoisobutyl phthalate) (\u00b5g/L)\n\nLow education High education\n\nFigure 4.16 presents the differences in the \nconcentrations of mercury in the hair of mothers \nand children between families with the highest \nlevel of education and those with the lowest level of \neducation. Across all 17 EU countries, mercury levels \nin hair were higher in both children and their mothers \nwhen the family had higher levels of educational \nattainment (Den\u00a0Hond et al., 2015). This is linked \nto higher levels of fish consumption among higher \nsocio-economic groups. The largest difference between \neducational levels is seen in Ireland, although mercury \nconcentrations were not extremely high or low in \nIreland. See Box 4.23 for a discussion of the health \nimpacts of human exposure to mercury in Europe. \n\nAs a final example, cadmium is a highly toxic metal \naffecting kidneys and bones and is linked to lung \ncancer, cardiovascular disease, hormone-related \ncancer and developmental effects in children. The \nprincipal exposure route is smoking. For non-smokers, \nthe consumption of food grown or raised in soil \n\ncontaminated with cadmium is the main exposure \npathway. Soils may be contaminated by industrial activity \nor through fertilisers that contain cadmium. A\u00a0recent \nWHO report analysed the Democophes data and found \nthat, in 10 out of 15 countries, the cadmium body \nburden of mothers and children increased with lower \nlevels of education (WHO Europe, 2019a). The largest \ndifferences were observed in countries where absolute \ncadmium concentrations were highest, implying that \nthere are opportunities to reduce exposure.\n\nThis review of the available evidence demonstrates \nthe role of social dimensions, including diet, smoking, \nhousing conditions, residential area and behaviours, \nin\u00a0influencing internal chemical exposure. The influence \nruns both ways, with a bias towards higher or lower \nsocial groups, depending on the specific chemical. \nFurther research is required to better understand how \nsocial status drives exposure to different chemicals, \nas\u00a0a basis for informing measures targeted at reducing \nexposure amongst vulnerable groups. \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n110 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nMothers\n\nSpain\n\nPortugal\n\nCyprus\n\nLuxembourg\n\nBelgium\n\nSlovenia\n\nSweden\n\nIreland\n\nCzechia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nPoland\n\nSlovakia\n\nGermany\n\nRomania\n\nHungary\n\nChildren\n\n0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\n\nLow education High education\n\nMercury (\u00b5g/g) Mercury (\u00b5g/g)\n\n1.81.61.4 2.0\n\nSources:  Data from Democophes country-specific statistical analysis reports.\n\nFigure 4.16  Mercury concentrations in the hair of mothers and children, 2011-2012\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n111Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.23  Human exposure to mercury and health impacts in Europe \n\nMercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pollutant that is naturally present in the environment and also released \nby human activity (EEA, 2018e). Mercury affects the nervous system, kidneys and lungs, and foetal exposure affects the \ndevelopment of the brain and nervous system. High levels of exposure can result in symptoms such as vision and hearing \nproblems and delays in language development and memory. The principal route of human exposure to mercury is diet, \nwhich is due to the bioaccumulation of methylmercury in the food chain, in particular in large predatory fish species \n(e.g.\u00a0marlin, swordfish and tuna).\n\nThe Democophes human biomonitoring study found the highest mercury body burdens in countries with higher levels of \nfish consumption (Den Hond et al., 2015). Using the Democophes data, it was estimated that, every year in Europe, nearly \n1.9 million babies are born with mercury levels above a recommended safe limit, i.e. approximately one third of all births. \nCountries with higher levels of large predatory fish consumption were estimated to have proportionately more babies \nborn with mercury levels above the limit. The potential impact on children's brain development is lifelong and can result \nin\u00a0significant cognitive impairment with related economic costs (Bellanger et al., 2013).\n\nDietary exposure to mercury can be managed through dietary advice (Casta\u00f1o et al., 2015), provided at a national level in \nEU Member States (EEA, 2018d). For example, a Danish study (Kirk et al., 2017) offered pregnant women dietary advice to \nhelp them lower their mercury intake without reducing their fish consumption by avoiding large predatory fish. The women \ncompleted a questionnaire on their dietary habits, including fish intake, and an initial sample of their hair was taken for \nmercury analysis. Based on the initial sample, 22\u00a0% of the women had mercury levels above the safe limit. A sample taken \n3 months later saw this reduced to 8\u00a0%, with a significantly lower average mercury level seen across all participants. The \noverall fish consumption levels remained constant, indicating that the changes in mercury levels resulted from consuming \nless predatory fish.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n112 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nWith people spending up to 90\u00a0% of their time indoors \n(Vardoulakis et al., 2015), air quality inside homes, \noffices, schools, nurseries, healthcare facilities and \nother buildings is an important health determinant. \nIndoor air quality is affected by pollutants brought \n\ninto buildings from outside, as well as pollutants \noriginating indoors. Figure 4.17 depicts the various \npotential sources of indoor air pollution, while \nBox\u00a04.24 identifies policies that contribute to indoor \nair quality. \n\n \nBox 4.24  Policies contributing to indoor air quality\n\nPolicy frameworks explicitly tackling indoor air pollution are, for the most part, lacking at the European level. There are no \nmonitoring requirements for indoor air quality in the EU, meaning that there is no consolidated data set at the European \nlevel.\n\nRegarding buildings, European standards are in place for the ventilation of buildings, EN 1506. The Energy Performance of \nBuildings Directive (EU, 2010) aims to promote the health and well-being of building users through increased consideration \nof air quality and ventilation.\n\nChemical legislation also has an impact on indoor air quality, including the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and \nRestriction of Chemicals Regulation (EU, 2006b), which regulates market access for industrial chemicals and policies limiting \nthe use of chemicals in products, such as Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances \nin electrical and electronic equipment (EU, 2011).\n\nThe World Health Organisation has issued reports that address indoor air pollution, including:\n\n\u2022 WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: dampness and mould (WHO Europe, 2009a);\n\n\u2022 WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: selected pollutants (WHO Europe, 2010); \n\n\u2022 WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion (WHO, 2014).\n\nThe 2016 Commission Recommendation\u00a02016/1318 on the promotion of nearly zero-energy buildings also includes \na\u00a0specific reference to indoor air quality issues, stating that a proper indoor environment should be ensured to prevent \nthe\u00a0deterioration of indoor air quality, comfort and health conditions in the European building stock (EC, 2016c).\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 Indoor air can be polluted with a mixture of ambient air pollutants, hazardous chemicals, radon and moulds, leading to \nsignificant health impacts.\n\n\u2022 An estimated 2 million disability-adjusted life-years are lost annually in the EU because of poor indoor air quality, \ndriven mainly by particulate matter.\n\n\u2022 Air quality in buildings results from a complex interplay between building quality and ventilation, outdoor air quality, \nand emissions from burning solid fuels, cleaning and consumer products and smoking.\n\n\u2022 Groups vulnerable to poor indoor air quality include children and the elderly. Improving air quality in schools, in \nparticular, offers significant health gains.\n\n\u2022 Efforts to improve indoor air quality require an integrated approach, including building design and management, \nproduct standards and education to foster positive behaviours.\n\n4.7 Indoor air quality and health\n\nhttp://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/air-quality/policy/who-guidelines-for-indoor-air-quality/biological-indoor-air-pollutants-dampness-and-mould-2009\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n113Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nFigure 4.17  Sources contributing to indoor air pollution\n\n1/Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone\nThe use of solid fuels such as coal, wood or other biomass, for cooking and for residential heating releases particulate matter.\nAmbient air polluted with particulate matter, ozone and/or nitrogen dioxide enters buildings via open window and gaps in the walls. \nAir pollution causes irritation of eyes, nose and throat, can cause breathing difficulties and is associated with non-communicable diseases.\n\n2/Synthetic chemicals\nCleaning products contain chemicals that pose known or suspected hazards to health. Plastic products release plasticisers into air and \ndust as they degrade. Electronic and electrical equipment, textiles and furniture contain flame retardants, with older products likely \nto contain chemicals now banned from use in Europe. Products containing perfume, such as air fragrance, personal care products and \nscented candles, release endocrine disruptors.\n\n3/Biological pollutants\nFungi, such as moulds, and bacteria grow in moist building materials. Mycotoxins released from fungi have carcinogenic, \nimmunotoxins, cytotoxic and mutagenic effects.\n\n4/Radon\nThe radioactive gas radon occurs naturally in certain rocks and soil and can infiltrate into houses. Inhaling radon gas damages the \nlungs and can cause lung cancer.\n\n5/Tobacco smoke\nIndoor tobacco consumption exposes all household members to secondary tobacco smoke. Exposure to second-hand smoke is \nassociated with chronic obstructive pulmonary heart disease and chronic respiratory disease, with particularly severe implications for \nchildren.\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\nSource: EEA and JRC (2013).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n114 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n4.7.1 Health impacts of indoor air pollution\n\nExposure to indoor air pollution is associated with a \nnumber of non-communicable diseases. An estimated \n2 million DALYs are lost annually in the EU because \nof poor indoor air quality (Asikainen et al., 2016). \nExposure to indoor air pollution is estimated to reduce \nproductivity and learning by up to 15\u00a0%. In France, it \nhas been estimated that the annual cost of indoor air \npollution relating to premature deaths, healthcare \nand production losses comes to approximately \nEUR\u00a020 billion for six pollutants, equating to \n1\u00a0% of total French GDP (Boulanger et al., 2017). \nFine PM (PM2.5) contributes the largest fraction.\n\nEstimates of deaths attributable to household \nair pollution by disease group are presented in \nTable 4.4 for the EU-28, the EEA-33 and the EEA-33 plus \nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North \nMacedonia and Serbia (EEA-39). The principal diseases \nresulting in deaths attributable to household air \npollution are ischaemic heart disease, cancers and \nstrokes, similar to the diseases driving mortality from \nambient air pollution. These data from the WHO Global \nHealth Observatory focus on exposure to indoor smoke \nfrom the use of solid fuel for cooking, which is not \nvery common in most EU countries. The use of solid \nfuel for cooking may explain the significant increase in \nattributable deaths when the West Balkan countries \nunder the EEA-39 were included.\n\nFor many countries, zero deaths were attributable to \nhousehold air pollution. This explains why the figures \n\nfor the EEA-33 and the EU-28 are the same, since the \nnon-EU EEA member countries Norway, Switzerland \nand Iceland had no deaths, while there were no data \nfor Turkey and Lichtenstein.\n\nSick Building Syndrome describe situations in which \noccupants experience acute health effects and \ndiscomfort linked to spending time in a building, with \nno specific illness diagnosed (Chirico et al., 2017). \nThere may be links between Sick Building Syndrome \nand indoor air quality (Jafari et al., 2015). Indoor \npollutants known to pose health risks are discussed in \nturn below.\n\nPM, NO2 and ozone\n\nAmbient air polluted with NO2, ozone and/or PM can \nenter buildings via cracks and gaps in the exterior \nwalls of the building or via open windows, affecting \nthe health of people in the building, as described in \nSection\u00a04.1. It is estimated that almost 80\u00a0% of the \nburden of disease from indoor exposures is caused \nby exposure to PM2.5 in the EU (Asikainen et al., 2016). \nImportant indoor sources of PM include candles and \nthe cooking and burning of solid fuels such as coal, \nwood or other biomass (Isaxon et al., 2015). Evidence \nsuggests that indoor PM may be more bioactive \nthan ambient particles because of the presence of \nendotoxins and other pro-inflammatory components in \nindoor particles (EC and JRC, 2012).\n\nEvidence that climate change exacerbates indoor air \npollution is considered in Box 4.25.\n\nTable 4.4 Deaths attributable to household air pollution by disease, EU-28, EEA-33 and EEA-39, 2016\n\nDeaths attributable to household air pollution\n\nDisease EU-28 EEA-33 EEA-39\n\nIschaemic heart disease 6\u00a0062 6\u00a0062 10\u00a0237\n\nTrachea, bronchus, lung cancers 2\u00a0280 2\u00a0280 4\u00a0375\n\nStroke 2\u00a0937 2\u00a0937 5\u00a0671\n\nLower respiratory infections 1\u00a0686 1\u00a0686 2\u00a0245\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease 1\u00a0693 1\u00a0693 3\u00a0127\n\nTotal 14\u00a0659 14\u00a0659 25\u00a0653\n\nNote:  Data for the EEA-39 exclude data for Lichtenstein, Kosovo and Turkey because no data are available; data for the EEA-33 exclude data for \nLichtenstein and Turkey because no data are available. \n\nSource:  WHO (2018b).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n115Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nRadon\n\nAnother outdoor factor causing indoor air pollution \nis radon \u2014 a natural occurring radioactive gas that \npermeates up from the ground \u2014 the source of which \nis naturally occurring radioactive elements in certain \nsoil and rock formations. Across Europe high radon \nconcentrations occur naturally in the Bohemium \nMassif of Czechia, in the Iberian Peninsula across \nSpain and Portugal, in the Massif Central of southern \nFrance and in Cornwall, United Kingdom. In France, \nexposure to radon is the second leading cause of lung \ncancer after smoking, with between 1\u00a0000 and 5\u00a0000 \ndeaths attributable to radon each year (Ajrouche \net al., 2018). In the United Kingdom, radon is the \nlargest natural source of human exposure to ionising \nradiation. Once detected, radon is relatively easy to \naddress through the installation of radon barriers or \nsumps.\n\nHazardous chemicals\n\nIn terms of exposure to hazardous chemicals in \nindoor air, concerns focus on chemical additives in \nplastic consumer goods, volatile organic compounds \n(VOCs) in building materials and flame retardants \nin furniture, building materials and electrical goods. \nPeople are exposed by breathing in contaminated \nair or by inhaling contaminated dust particles. Young \nchildren crawl on the ground where they can be \nexposed to dust and chemicals that accumulate on \nthe floor. \n\nChemicals used as plasticisers, such as bisphenols \n(including BPA; and the substitutes bisphenol S, BPS, \nand bisphenol F, BPF) and phthalates, are released \ninto the air in small amounts as plastic degrades \nand are collected in dust. Although European data \nare scare, Larsson et al. (2017) found phthalates, \nnon-phthalate plasticisers and bisphenols in \ndust from 100 Swedish preschools. The levels \nof several substitute plasticisers were higher in \n\nnewer preschools, whereas the levels of the strictly \nregulated phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate\u00a0(DnBP), \nwere higher in older preschools. Nevertheless, the \nchildren's exposure from ingesting preschool dust \nwas below relevant health-based reference values. \n\nVOCs, such as formaldehyde and benzene, are \nemitted\u00a0from building materials, furniture and \npaints and may cause significant health effects. The \nshort-term consequences include skin irritation, \ndizziness and nausea, while in the longer term some \nVOCs are carcinogenic (Duarte-Davidson et al., 2001). \nChildren\u00a0exposed to concentrations of VOCs higher \nthan  60\u00a0\u00b5g/m3 have a fourfold increase in the risk of \ndeveloping asthma (Rumchev et al., 2007).\n\nA large group of chemicals known as flame retardants \nhave been used to lower the flammability of products, \nfurniture and construction materials. Some, such as \nPBDEs, have been linked to neurotoxicity through \nendocrine disruption (Eskenazi, et al., 2013). \nThe economic costs of losses in IQ (Intelligence \nQuotient) due to exposure to PBDEs are estimated \nat EUR\u00a011 billion (Grandjean and Bellanger, 2017). \nPBDEs are now restricted at the EU level and under \nthe Stockholm Convention, and this has driven their \nreplacement with substitutes, known as emerging \nflame retardants.\n\nA review of children's exposure to flame retardants \nfound high concentrations of legacy PBDEs in \ndust from\u00a0houses, kindergartens and primary \nschools in Europe (Malliari and Kalantzi, 2017). \nHuman\u00a0biomonitoring studies that measured \nbrominated and/or phosphorylated flame retardants \nin toddlers' (8- to 24-month-olds) serum, urine, \nhand wipes and faeces found that toddlers were \nexposed to a range of flame retardants associated \nwith thyroid disruption. Exposure is linked to the \nindoor environment, via products such as plastic toys \n(Sugeng\u00a0et al., 2017). The few studies that have looked \nat both legacy and emerging flame retardants in \n\n \nBox 4.25  Climate change and indoor air pollution\n\n\u2022 Warmer summer temperatures may lead occupants to open windows more often, coinciding with periods of high \noutdoor ozone levels and resulting in increased indoor exposure.\n\n\u2022 Energy efficiency interventions to reduce ventilation may lead to the accumulation of indoor air pollutants.\n\n\u2022 Climate change is likely to increase ambient dust levels as a result of drier weather conditions in many areas of Europe \nand cause associated increases in dust levels inside buildings.\n\nSource:    Vardoulakis et al. (2015).\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/serum\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n116 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nindoor air in the United Kingdom (Tao et\u00a0al., 2016) and \nSpain (Reche et al., 2019) have detected lower levels \nof legacy flame retardants and higher concentrations \nof emerging flame retardants, indicative of \nprogressive substitution. However, evidence is now \nemerging of the\u00a0health concerns associated with \nsome emerging flame retardants.\n\nOlder construction materials and products with \nlonger lifecycles may contain hazardous chemicals \nthat are now controlled. For example, older furniture \nmay contain legacy flame retardants that are now \nbanned, such as PBDEs. Similarly, the now-banned \npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were widely used \nin construction materials in the 1970s and 1980s and \ncan be present in indoor air (Gunnarsen, et al., 2017). \nPCBs have been linked to cancer, immunosuppression \nand endocrine and reproductive disorders (UNEP \nand AMEP, 2011). An example of efforts to reduce \nchemical emissions to air in Denmark is provided in \nBox 4.26.\n\nBiological pollutants\n\nDamp and mould also pose health risks in indoor \nsettings. Mould and bacteria accumulate when \nmoisture levels are adequate, and this is exacerbated \nby poor ventilation. When spores become part of \nthe air humans breathe, there are increased risks of \nallergic and hypersensitivity reactions, exposure to \ntoxins and infections (Vardoulakis et al., 2015). Fungi \ncan produce over 300 different mycotoxins, thought \nto have carcinogenic, immunotoxins, cytotoxic and \nmutagenic effects (Gutarowska and Piotrowska, 2007).\n\nTobacco smoke\n\nThe health impacts of tobacco smoking are well \ndocumented; yet, across Europe a large proportion of \nthe population continue to be exposed to second-hand \nsmoke. More than one in four people who work indoors \nare exposed to second-hand smoke at work (Filippidis \nand Vardavas, 2017). Exposure to second-hand smoke \nis associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary \nheart disease and chronic respiratory disease, with \nparticularly severe implications for children (Jordan \net\u00a0al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015). The rising consumption \nof e-cigarettes must be factored into future indoor air \nquality issues, a behaviour for which the health impacts \nremain largely unknown (Callahan-Lyon, 2014).\n\nCombined exposure\n\nIt is clear from the discussion above that indoor air \ncan contain a broad range of pollutants, including \nchemicals, allergens and microbes that may have \ncombined impacts on health. For example, there \nis evidence to suggest that chemical air pollution \nmay interact with airborne allergens to enhance the \nsymptoms of those who are pre-disposed to specific \nallergies and asthma (Baldacci et al., 2015). Mixtures of \nhazardous chemicals that have similar health effects \ncan have an impact on human health in an additive or \nsynergistic fashion. However, the complexity of indoor \nair and its variability over time and location make \ngeneralised risk assessments extremely challenging.\n\nSolutions for improving indoor air are considered in \nBox 4.27.\n\n \nBox 4.26  Danish emissions labelling scheme\n\nThe voluntary material emission labelling scheme 'Danish Indoor Climate Labelling' was established in 1993. The purpose of \nscheme is to:\n\n\u2022 improve the air quality in buildings by documenting the impact of products on indoor air quality;\n\n\u2022 contribute to the development of indoor friendly products; \n\n\u2022 support the selection of indoor friendly products.\n\nOriginally intended for building products, the scheme now also covers furniture, fixtures and fittings, with active labelling \nlicences issued for more than 3\u00a0000 individual products. The labelling scheme has proved to be useful in several ways. \nThere is now an increased focus on low emitting materials; there has been a tendency towards generally lowered emission \nlevels among the labelled products over the years; and in many cases test results have been used actively for product \ndevelopment.\n\nSource:    Dansk Indekilma Markning (2018). \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n117Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n4.7.2 Vulnerable groups\n\nVulnerable groups and indoor air pollution\n\nCertain groups are particularly susceptible to the \neffects of indoor air pollution. Vulnerable groups \nsuch as children (see Box 4.28), the elderly and \npeople exhibiting poor health are concentrated in \nkindergartens, retirement homes and hospitals, \nrespectively (EEA and JRC, 2013). People with asthma, \ncardiovascular disease or respiratory disease \nare particularly vulnerable to indoor air pollution \n(Cincinelli\u00a0and Martellini, 2017).\n\nSocio-economic aspects of indoor air pollution\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that there is \na\u00a0socio-economic dimension to indoor air pollution \nexposure. This is likely to be exacerbated by the \nlink between lower socio-economic status and \npoor building quality, which increases the chances \nof poor ventilation, leading to mould and damp \n(WHO\u00a0Europe,\u00a02009b).\n\nThe use of solid fuel boilers or heaters exacerbates \nboth indoor and ambient air pollution from local \n\nheating. While the EU has set standards to improve \nthe efficiency of such devices under the Ecodesign \nDirective (EU, 2009b), these standards will only \ncome into force for new devices in 2022. Residential \ncombustion is a particularly significant source of PM2.5 \nin central Europe (EEA, 2018b). Replacing inefficient \nheating devices, often owned by low-income families, \nis a major challenge for citizens and some Member \nState authorities. For example, in the Polish region \nof Ma\u0142opolska, the anti-smog resolution under the \nregion's air quality plan restricts the use of solid fuels, \nwith the aim of achieving compliance with air pollution \nlimit values by 2023 (Ma\u0142opolska Region, 2019). At the \nsame time, the cost of replacing residential heating \nsources was estimated at over EUR\u00a01 billion, with \nno national funding available (European Court of \nAuditors,\u00a02018).\n\nThe effect that low socio-economic status has on the \nincreased exposure of children to adult second-hand \ncigarette smoke is also becoming clear (Bolte and \nFromme, 2009). In 2011, it was found that it was \n11\u00a0times more likely for a child to be exposed to \nsecond-hand smoke at home if their parent/s had \na\u00a0low level of education than if they had a high level \nof\u00a0education (Pisinger et al., 2012).\n\n \nBox 4.27  Solutions for improving indoor air quality\n\nThe EnVIE project developed a modelling tool to evaluate the relationship between indoor air quality-related diseases and \nexposures and the impact of policy control measures (EC, 2012b).\n\nThe follow-on project, 'Promoting actions for healthy indoor air (IAIAQ)', produced the EnVIE-IAIAQ modelling tool and \nprovides an update of the potential impact that policy actions might have on indoor air quality and health (Jantunen \net\u00a0al., 2011).\n\nThe HEALTHVENT project (Health-Based Ventilation Guidelines for Europe, 2008-2013) developed guidelines for \nhealth-based ventilation rates and recommended the implementation of mechanical ventilation, to filter outdoor air if it \ndoes not meet existing air quality guidelines (Fernandes et al., 2015).\n\nImproving building ventilation offers a means of tackling indoor air pollution, for example Almeida-Silva et al. (2014) found \nthat concentrations of common pollutants exceeded limit values in an elderly care home because of poor ventilation. Higher \nventilation rates in offices reduce the prevalence of Sick Building Syndrome, while home ventilation rates are associated \nwith reduced allergy symptoms in children (Sundell et al., 2011). Current technology tends to circulate the air inside \nbuildings, reducing air quality (Spiru and Simona, 2017). The burden of disease from indoor air pollution could be reduced \nby improving ventilation, filtering air as it moves into a building, sealing buildings and reducing the pollution caused by \nindoor sources. It is estimated that this could reduce the health risks of indoor air pollution from 2 million disability-adjusted \nlife-years (DALYs) to between 400\u00a0000 and 900\u00a0000 DALYs in the EU (Asikainen et al., 2016).\n\nThere are calls for new building designs to deliver a 'smart home', with advanced sensor technology offering greater living \ncomfort and health (Schieweck et al., 2018).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n118 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.28  Indoor air quality in schools\n\nChildren spend large amounts of time indoors and are particularly susceptible to the health effects of indoor air pollution. \nIn Europe, 64 million students and almost 4.5 million teachers spend many hours each day in schools and kindergartens. \nIndoor air quality in school buildings can negatively affect the health, attendance and performance of children, teachers \nand\u00a0school staff.\n\nThe Schools Indoor Pollution and Health Observatory Network in Europe (Sinphonie) is an EU-funded research project \nthat collected information on indoor air quality and children's health from schools in 25 European countries (EC, 2014). \nParticulate matter with a diameter of 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds, radon and biological agents were \ncommonly detected in classrooms, sometimes in elevated concentrations above existing guideline values proposed by the \nEU and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nIndoor air quality in school buildings is influenced by outdoor air pollution, the age of the school buildings, location, cleaning, \nmaintenance and ventilation strategies. The use of paints, glues and other products are also potentially important sources \nof indoor pollution. PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and noise contribute to pollution in schools, with 67\u00a0% of all schools \nmonitored located by busy roads.\n\nRecommendations include the following:\n\n\u2022 Ambient air quality should meet WHO guidelines.\n\n\u2022 Newly constructed schools should consider indoor air quality, chose clean construction materials and implement \nhealth-based ventilation.\n\n\u2022 School building management procedures should consider the vulnerability of children.\n\n\u2022 Awareness raising should be implemented for children, parents and school staff.\n\n\u2022 When considering the total pollution burden on children, the school environment must be fully integrated.\n\nSource:   EC (2014). \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n119Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nElectromagnetic fields (EMFs) are a combination of \ninvisible electrical and magnetic fields of force. They are \ngenerated by natural phenomena, such as the Earth's \nmagnetic field, but also by human activities, mainly \nthe use of electricity (EC, 2009). EMFs are generated by \nmany devices, such as mobile phones, televisions, power \ntools and electrical power lines. Certain applications \ndeliberately use EMF, for example the use of static \nmagnetic fields in magnetic resonance imaging for \nmedical purposes.\n\nThere are two types of EMF: ionising and non-ionising \nradiation. Ionising radiation includes EMF of mid to \nhigh-frequency, such as ultraviolet rays, x-rays and \ngamma rays, the energy from which can damage human \ncells and cause cancer. Non-ionising EMFs are normally \ncategorised based on the frequency of the field, typically:\n\n\u2022 radio frequency (RF \u2014 100 kHz to 300 GHz);\n\n\u2022 intermediate frequency (IF \u2014 300 Hz to 100 kHz); \n\n\u2022 extremely low frequency (ELF \u2014 0 Hz to 300 Hz); \n\n\u2022 static (0 Hz). \n\nMore recently, EMFs in the terahertz (THz) range have \nalso become more widely used.\n\nThere are direct and indirect health effects of exposure \nto EMFs that are well understood. Direct effects at \ndifferent frequency ranges are shown in Figure\u00a04.18, \nand include non-thermal effects (such as the \nstimulation of nerves, muscles and sensory organs) and \nthermal effects (such as tissue heating). These effects \nare normally short term and transient and cease when \nthe EMF is deactivated.\n\nIndirect effects relate to situations in which the \npresence of an object within an EMF may cause a \nsafety or health hazard (EC, 2015b). Indirect effects \ncould include, for example, interference with implanted \nmedical devices in the human body.\n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 There are well-defined acute human effects of exposure to certain electromagnetic fields, including symptoms such as \nnerve and sensory organ stimulation and the heating of tissues.\n\n\u2022 There is currently little scientifically established evidence of causal relationships between long-term exposure and \nreported symptoms, though in some cases there is certainly a clear need for further research.\n\n\u2022 Given the limitations in the current evidence base and the expected increase in exposure of the European population \nto radio frequency electromagnetic fields following deployment of 5G, further research is needed regarding possible \nhealth effects.\n\n\u2022 The World Health Organization is carrying out further research on electromagnetic fields exposure, to provide more \ncomprehensive conclusions on the potential long-term health effects.\n\nNote:  Frequency intervals are not to scale.\n\nSource:  EC (2015b).\n\nFigure 4.18  The effects of non-ionising EMFs in different frequencies \n\nVertigo and \nnausea \n\nSensory, nerve and \nmuscle stimulation\n\nHeating of body or \nlocalised tissues\n\nHeating of \nsurface tissues\n\nSTATIC LOW INTERMEDIATE HIGH\n\nINCREASING FREQUENCY\n\n4.8 Electromagnetic fields and health\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n120 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.29  Policies on EMF\n\nIn 1999, the Council of the European Union published a recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the general \npublic to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) (Council of the European Union, 1999). This included recommended reference \nvalues for high voltage power lines of 5\u00a0kilovolts per metre for electric fields and 100\u00a0microteslas for magnetic fields. As this \nis a recommendation, it has not been applied in all EU Member States. Some countries have chosen to implement more \nstringent reference values. The different approaches taken by different Member States are illustrated in Map 4.9, which \nshows the variation in the limits for power frequency EMFs. There are also variations in the limits applied to radio frequency \nEMFs (not shown).\n\nThe EMF Directive was adopted in 2013 (EU, 2013b) to protect workers from both the direct and the indirect effects of \nEMFs in the workplace. The directive does not address the long-term effects of exposure to EMFs because of a lack of \ncausal evidence of harm to health. If such evidence emerges, then the Commission will consider the necessary means for \naddressing such effects (EC, 2014).\n\nIn the European Commission\u2019s 2016 communication on connectivity for a competitive digital single market, towards \na European gigabit society (EC, 2016a), the deployment of very high capacity fifth generation telecommunications \ntechnologies\u00a0(5G) across Europe by 2025 is identified as a critical building block of the digital economy and society. It \nsets 2025 connectivity targets for public service providers, transport hubs and major terrestrial transport routes, digital \nenterprises, and urban and rural households. Specifically, urban areas, major roads and railways should have uninterrupted \n5G coverage. The 5G for Europe Action Plan (EC, 2016b) sets out measures for the timely and coordinated deployment of 5G \nacross the EU. Adopted in 2018, the European Electronic Communications Code (EU, 2018) paves the way for the uptake of \n5G across the EU. It recognises the need to ensure that citizens are not exposed to electromagnetic fields at levels harmful \nto public health, with Member States able to restrict the types of radio networks or wireless access technology to protect \nhuman health.\n\nCurrent questions focus on the impact of rolling out the \nfifth generation of telecommunications technologies, \nknown as 5G, intended to power the Internet of Things. \nCompared to previous generations of communications \ntechnology, 5G employs higher frequency radio waves \nthat have shorter ranges, requiring a dense network \nof antennas and transmitters to deliver significantly \nimproved connectivity. Such a dense network is \npredicted to result in constant exposure of the \npopulation to RF EMF, a form of non-ionising radiation, \nwith some researchers expressing concerns regarding \nimpacts on human health (Karaboytcheva, 2020).\n\nPolicies to address human exposure to EMF and to \nsupport the role out of 5G in Europe are presented in \nBox 4.29.\n\n4.8.1 Longer term effects of exposure to EMFs\n\nThe European Commission Scientific Committee on \nEmerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) \npublished an opinion on the potential health effects \nof exposure to EMFs (EC, 2015c). The report examines \navailable evidence of the impacts from different \nfrequencies of EMFs, with the conclusions broadly \nestablishing that there is little convincing evidence of \ncausal relationships between exposure and reported \nsymptoms, though in some cases there is a clear need \nfor further research.\n\nThere are a limited number of studies investigating \nthe effects of very high frequency EMFs \u2014 THz EMFs \n\u2014 but they do not provide evidence of specific health \nimpacts. The SCENIHR recommends that, as a result of \nthe expected increase in use of THz technology, further \nresearch on its effects is necessary.\n\nRF EMFs are associated with mobile phone usage, as \nwell as the deployment of 5G, and are of particular \ninterest to the public in terms of the potential health \neffects. In 2011, the International Agency for Research \non Cancer (IARC) classified RF EMF as a possible \nhuman carcinogen, based largely on limited evidence \nof increased risks of gliomas and acoustic neuromas \namong long-term users of cell phones (IARC, 2011). \nIn contrast, the 2015 SCENIHR report indicates that \nstudies on mobile phone exposure do not show an \nincreased risk of brain tumours or other cancers in \nthe neck and head region. However, there is evidence \nthat RF EMF exposure can affect brain activity when \na person is awake and also during sleep, though the \npotential impacts of this are not clear. The report \nfound a lack of evidence linking RF EMF exposure to \nimpaired cognitive function, neurological diseases or \nreproduction and developmental effects (EC, 2015c). \n\nA Danish review of more than 28 000 children found \nthat an elevated risk of behavioural problems was \nassociated with both the mother's and the child's \nown mobile phone use (Divan, 2012). In this study, \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n121Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nSource:  RIVM (2018).\n\nMap 4.9  Overview of limits for exposure of the general population to power frequency EMFs in the EU\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n700\u00b0\u00b060\u00b0\nOverview of limits for exposure \nof the general population to\npower frequency EMF in the EU\n\nGroup 1 - legal limits\nderived from EU\nrecommendation\nGroup 2 - no legal limits or\nless strict limits than in the\nEU recommendation\nGroup 3 - stricter limits\nthan in the EU\nrecommendation\n\nNon EU countries\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km0\n\nexposure to mobile phones was also associated with \nlower socio-economic status, maternal smoking and \nthe younger age of mothers, which slightly weakened \nthe strength of the association between exposure \nand the prevalence of behavioural problems.\n\nMore recently, in a 2018 statement on emerging \nenvironment and health risks, the Scientific Committee \non Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) \nhighlighted the potential effects of increases in \nelectromagnetic radiation on wildlife as a concern, \nnoting that health and safety issues remain unknown \nand there is a lack of evidence to inform exposure \nguidelines for 5G (SCHEER, 2018). Some scientists \nhave expressed concerns that children born today \n\nwill experience cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to RF \nEMR, in a context where health impacts remain poorly \nunderstood (Russell, 2018). A 2018 review found evidence \nthat RF-EMF exposure drives biomedical effects in \nanimals, increasing oxidative stress, a condition involved \nin cancer onset, as well as in several acute and chronic \ndiseases and in vascular homeostasis (Di Ciaula, 2018). \nIn follow up, a report of the Swedish Radiation Safety \nAuthority found that the association between exposure \nto EMF and oxidative stress was not conclusive (Swedish \nRadiation Safety Authority, 2019). In terms of current \nexposure levels, a recent review found that RF-EMF \nexposure levels were highest in public settings, including \nlibraries, train and tram stations, followed by outdoor \nand private indoor environments. Everyday RF-EMF \n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n122 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nexposure was not found to have increased since 2012, \ndespite the increased use of wireless communication \ndevices (Jalilian, et al., 2019).\n\nGiven the limitations in the current evidence base, \ncoupled with the expected increase in exposure for the \nEuropean population, further research regarding the \npossible long-term health effects of 5G deployment is \nimportant.\n\nIn relation to ELF fields, existing studies do not provide \nconvincing evidence for a causal relationship between \nexposure and reported symptoms. A range of studies \nhave found an increased risk of childhood leukaemia \nassociated with exposure to ELF fields; however, no \ncausal relationship can be identified, as no plausible \nmechanisms have been identified (EC,\u00a02015c).\n\nThere are concerns that RF EMF may interact \nsynergistically with other environmental stressors \nto affect health, with a recent study cautioning \nagainst possible systemic health effects (Kostoff, \net al., 2020). The SCENIHR report also examined \nthe potential impacts of co-exposure to EMFs \nand environmental stressors, with no definitive \nconclusions. The report recommends further \nresearch on the effects of co-exposure with other \nagents (EC, 2015c).\n\nThe WHO remains concerned about the potential \nhealth effects of EMF exposure, particularly \nregarding the knowledge gaps highlighted above. \nThe WHO has an ongoing international EMF project \nassessing the health and environmental effects of \nelectric and magnetic fields (WHO, 2018g).\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n123Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nEarly work on environmental risks to health \nconcentrated on single stressors in isolation. The reality \nis that people are exposed to multiple stressors at \nany one time and throughout their lives. In particular, \nthe urban environment, where the majority of the \nEuropean population resides, is characterised by \nthe presence of multiple environmental hazards and \nreduced access to green spaces. It is the combined \nimpact of these various stressors mediated by an \nindividual's biological condition and social position that \ndetermine the health outcome for any one individual. \nAs evidenced in the sections above, socially deprived \nurban neighbourhoods are often exposed to higher \nlevels of noise and air pollution and often have a lack \nof\u00a0green spaces.\n\nThere are currently two principal approaches to \ncollating evidence to understand combined exposures. \nThe first, known as the 'exposome', aims to capture \nall environmental exposures at the level of the \nindividual, from conception to the end of their life, \nas a means of understanding environmental disease \nrisk factors (Siroux et al., 2016). The second maps the \nspatial coincidence of multiple stressors by overlaying \nenvironmental monitoring data from different \nmedia, as well as social and demographic data. Both \napproaches cover not only environmental stressors \nbut\u00a0also social vulnerability.\n\nThis section reviews evidence of the combined impact \nof environmental and social stressors on health and \nsummarises the results of efforts using these two \napproaches.\n\n4.9.1 Cumulative and synergistic health impacts of \nmultiple stressors\n\nWhile evidence suggests that environmental stressors \nact synergistically on the human body to cause health \noutcomes, our understanding of the mechanisms \ninvolved remains limited.\n\nThe impact of a mixture of chemicals has come under \nparticular scrutiny, with methods now emerging for \ncombined risk assessment, as discussed in Section 4.6. \nIndoor air pollution can be made up of a mixture of \npollutants that have additive effects, including carbonyls, \nVOCs, terpenes, PM and PAHs (WHO Europe, 2013b).\n\nThere is evidence of synergistic effects of exposure to \nair pollution (PM10 and ozone) and high temperatures \nleading to increased morbidity and mortality (Macintyre \net al., 2018). In one study, air pollution exposure and \nheat exposure, together, explained about one third of \nthe association between residential proximity to roads \nand low birth weight (Dadvand et al., 2014b). In relation \nto cold temperatures, the combination of PM10 and \nlow temperatures increased morbidity for myocardial \ninfarction in two provinces of Portugal (Vasconcelos et\u00a0al., \n2013). Allergen patterns are changing in response to \nclimate change, with air pollution modifying the allergenic \npotential of pollens. While the underlying mechanisms \nare not understood, the health consequences include \nrespiratory problems, allergic diseases, the exacerbation \nof chronic respiratory diseases and premature death \n(De Sario et al., 2013). There may also be an interaction \nbetween chemicals and climate change, in which \n\n \nKey messages:\n\n\u2022 People are exposed to multiple environmental stressors at any one time, combining \u2014 and in some cases acting \nsynergistically \u2014 to have an impact on health. In particular, air pollution and high temperatures act synergistically, \nleading to increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n\u2022 Social factors such as advanced age, poverty and pre-existing health conditions intensify the impacts of environmental \nhealth hazards on vulnerable groups, exacerbating health inequities.\n\n\u2022 The urban population is particularly exposed to multiple stressors including air pollution, noise and chemicals while \nalso having reduced access to green space. A high proportion of pregnant women and children in European cities were \nfound to be exposed to air pollution and noise levels above health-based guidance values.\n\n\u2022 The environmental burden of disease resulting from children's exposure to seven environmental stressors is estimated \nat 211\u00a0000 disability-adjusted life-years per year in children in the 28 Member States of the EU, with air pollution being \nthe main contributor to this burden.\n\n\u2022 Early efforts to map combined exposures to environmental and social stressors can identify areas at both the regional \nand the urban level that are vulnerable to the health impacts of environmental stressors.\n\n4.9 Health impacts of multiple stressors\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n124 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ntemperature may increase pesticide toxicity (Hooper \net\u00a0al., 2012).\n\nAir pollution and noise share some sources, such as \nroad traffic and industrial activities, and their effects are \ndifficult to disentangle. In cities, people exposed to air \npollution tend to be also exposed to noise. The health \neffects of both types of stressors are similar and can \ntherefore have a synergistic effect on human health (EEA, \n2018a). The combined health impact of road traffic noise \nand air pollution across 497 European cities is estimated \nat an average of 1\u00a0745 DALYs per year per 100\u00a0000 \ninhabitants, corresponding to 6.2\u00a0% of\u00a0the total burden of \ndisease for all causes per year (ETC/ACM, 2018).\n\nSocial status can increase vulnerability to environmental \nstressors through increased exposure and sensitivity and \nreduced resilience. Individual vulnerability is determined \nby both internal and external factors, which are in turn \ninfluenced by socio-economic status. Underlying health \nconditions are internal factors, while external factors \ninclude exposure to environmental stressors as well \nas diet, exercise levels and smoking behaviour. For \nexample, poor housing quality is linked to exposure to \nindoor antigens from mould, which increases the risk of \nrespiratory symptoms, resulting in increased sensitivity to \nair pollutants (Solomon et al., 2016).\n\nIn terms of the mechanisms through which psychological \nstress resulting from social conditions combines \nsynergistically with environmental stressors, one possible \npathway is allostatic load. Allostasis refers to the body's \nability to respond and adapt to transient stressors. Over \ntime, stress and unhealthy behaviours can impair the \nbody's ability to maintain allostasis, degrading bodily \nsystems, compromising immune function and increasing \nsusceptibility to environmental stressors (Clougherty et \nal., 2010). External factors, such as poor housing quality, \nas well as experiences, such as violence and racial \ndiscrimination, can increase allostatic load. External \nsocial conditions and internal biological susceptibility \nfactors interact with environmental hazard inequalities to \nexacerbate health disparities (Morello-Frosch et al., 2011). \nFor example, studies have found associations between \nviolence and family stress and increases in the effects \nof traffic-related air pollution on childhood asthma \n(Clougherty et al., 2007; Shankardass et al., 2009).\n\n4.9.2 Measuring exposure to multiple stressors\n\nThe exposome concept, depicted in Figure 4.19, \ndescribes the totality of human environmental \n\nexposures over a lifetime, in combination with gene \nexpression (Vrijheid, 2014). The concept links conditions \nand diseases of late childhood and adulthood to \nearly-life environmental conditions, to understand the \nrole of environmental stressors in driving disease.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2019, a cluster of exposome projects \nwere funded under the European Commission's \nHorizon 2020 research programme, including \nHELIX (20), HEALS (21) and EXPOsOMICS (22).\n\nHELIX\u00a0focused on identifying patterns of combined \nexposure to chemical and physical stressors among \npregnant women and children. A considerable \nproportion of pregnant women and children were \nfound to be exposed to fine PM and traffic noise in \ndense city environments at levels above health-based \nguidelines, as well as to have insufficient contact \nwith natural environments. In particular, chemicals \nwere detected in the blood and urine of over 90\u00a0% of \npregnant women and children. Apart from noise and \nPM, levels of the different environmental stressors \nwere generally not related (HELIX, 2018).\n\nAt the same time, exposure varied considerably across \nEurope for both chemicals and hazards related to city \nenvironments, confirming that location is a strong \ndeterminant of individual exposures. While in Bradford \npregnant women of a low socio-economic position \nwere exposed to higher levels of environmental \nhazards, in Oslo the opposite association was observed \n(Robinson et al., 2018).\n\nThe environmental burden of disease resulting from \nchildren's exposure to seven environmental stressors, \nincluding PM (PM10 and PM2.5), ozone, second-hand \nsmoke, dampness, lead and formaldehyde, was \nestimated at 211\u00a0000 DALYs per year in children in the \nEU-28 (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2019). The highest burden \nwas attributable to air pollution, including PM and \nozone.\n\nHEALS developed a methodology for European-wide \nassociation studies of the environment and health, \nincluding the use of internal exposure data from \nhuman biomonitoring to de-code the exposome \n(Steckling et al., 2018). EXPOsOMICS focused on \nassessing exposure to air and water contaminants at \nboth individual and population levels during critical \nperiods of life using tools for personal exposure \nmonitoring. Understanding external exposures is \ncomplemented by the use of omic technologies \nfor the analysis of biological samples to identify \n\n(20) www.projecthelix.eu\n(21) www.heals-eu.eu\n(22) www.exposomics-project.eu\n\nhttp://www.projecthelix.eu\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n125Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ninternal markers of exposures. The aim is to establish \nassociations between external exposures and biological \nmarkers in the same individual (Vineis et al., 2017).\n\nLooking forward, a new wave of exposome research \nis being funded under Horizon 2020. The aim is \nto produce more complete and more accurate \nindividual-level exposure data to allow an estimation \nof the largely unknown environmental component of \nnon-communicable diseases. The approach shifts away \nfrom 'one exposure, one disease' to a more complex \npicture of the environment, health and well-being \nnexus on which to build preventive actions and policies \nin the future.\n\n4.9.3 Mapping the spatial coincidence of multiple \nstressors\n\nAn alternative approach to understanding multiple \nstressors is to overlay monitoring data from different \n\nenvironmental domains, as well as social data, to \nidentify areas subject to multiple stressors.\n\nRecent EEA work demonstrates how high social \nvulnerability spatially coincides with the occurrence \nof multiple types of hazard at European level. \nMap 4.10 presents, on the left side, the number of \nenvironmental health hazards for which a given \nNUTS\u00a02 region is in the top 20\u00a0% in Europe in terms \nof exposure. The environmental health hazards \nconsidered include exposure to PM10, NO2, ozone, \nthe number of cooling degree days and the number \nof heating degree days\u00a0(23). Regions in Italy suffer \nfrom all three types of air pollution as well as high \ntemperatures. Regions where the population is \nsubstantially affected by three out of five hazards are \nlocated mainly in Greece, Italy and Spain. Of note, \nno regions in the north or north-west of Europe are \nsubstantially affected by more than two hazards.\n\nThe right-hand side of Map 4.10 shows the various \ndimensions of social vulnerability for which a given \n\nSource:  Based on Vrijheid (2014).\n\nSpecific external\nenvironment\n\nInternal\nenvironment\n\nGeneral external\nenvironment\n\nLife course dimension\n\nHealth risk and\nimpact assessment\n\nDiet Water\n\nConsumer\nproducts\n\nPhysical\nactivity\n\nGreen spacesTraffic\n\nUrban\nenvironment\n\nSocial\ncapital\n\nClimate\n\nTobacco\n\nFigure 4.19  The exposome concept\n\n(23) Cooling degree days is a measurement of the demand for the energy needed to cool a building to keep it at a comfortable temperature, \nwhile\u00a0heating degree days measures the energy needed to heat a building.\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n126 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nregion falls in the top 20\u00a0% in Europe. The dimensions \ncovered include the percentage of children under \n5\u00a0years old among the population; the percentage of \npeople aged 75 years or older among the population; the \naverage household income; the percentage of long-term \nunemployed among the working-age population; and \nthe percentage of people without higher education. \nThere are some regions with four out of five causes of \nvulnerability in the top 20\u00a0%; low levels of income and \neducation and high levels of unemployment overlap with \nhigh proportions of elderly people in Greece and with \nyoung children in Slovakia. The regions where high levels \nof three causes of vulnerability occur together are mainly \nlocated in Greece, Hungary, parts of Italy, Slovakia and \nindividual regions in Bulgaria and Portugal. No regions \nwith high levels of vulnerability for more than two causes \nare present in the north and north-west of Europe.\n\nThe regions where the highest number of causes \nof vulnerability overlaps with the highest number \nof hazards are mainly present in Greece, Italy \nand Slovakia. A division can be seen between the \nsouth-east and the north-west of Europe, as the \n\npopulation in the south-east are both more exposed \nand more vulnerable to environmental hazards that \nhave an impact on health. This shows that disparities \nin Europe are not only present in socio-economic \nterms (EC,\u00a02017d) but also redrawn in relation to \nenvironmental justice.\n\nThe Federal State of Berlin took a similar approach \nat city level, producing a map that integrated \nenvironmental burden with social status (see \nMap\u00a04.11), as described in Box 4.30.\n\nSuch efforts can help to identify areas that have \na particular vulnerability to the health impacts of \nenvironmental stressors, enabling authorities to direct \npolicy efforts to mitigate both environmental and social \nstressors. The challenge is to identify data sets for the \nsame scale and time frame that can be meaningfully \ncombined. Further efforts to map the spatial \ncoincidence of exposures to environmental stressors \nand social deprivation on fine scales within cities are \nneeded to better understand the dynamics at play in the \nurban setting and how they vary between cities.\n\nNote:  The map presents the number of environmental health hazards or causes of vulnerability for which a given NUTS\u00a02 region was classified \nin the top 20\u00a0% in Europe.\n\nSource:  EEA (2018a).\n\nMap 4.10  Multiple environmental hazards and multiple causes of vulnerability in Europe\n\n10 2 43 10 2 43\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km0\n\nMultiple hazards and multiple causes of vulnerability in Europe\n\nNumber of hazards in top 20 % Number of vulnerability causes in top 20 %\n\nNo data Outside coverage\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\f\nEnvironmental impacts on health and well-being\n\n127Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 4.30  Case study \u2014 Environmental Justice Initiative in Berlin\n\nIn 2010, the Federal State of Berlin initiated a project on environmental justice to examine the links between socio-economic \nstatus and health-related environmental conditions. The core objective of the citywide spatial analyses was to identify \nneighbourhoods with multiple burdens. The core indicators used as part of the assessment were noise, air pollution, green \nspace provision, bio-climatic load and social status. Twelve additional indicators \u2014 e.g. premature mortality, morbidity, \necosystem services and urban structure \u2014 complete the indicator set. The analyses indicate that neighbourhoods with \nmultiple environmental burdens tend to exhibit lower social status indicators.\n\nThe analyses of environmental justice form the basis for an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary monitoring system that \nis regularly updated. This 'early warning system' provides political decision-makers, urban and environmental planners and \nthe scientific community with a sound basis for decision-making, to be able to tackle changing environmental conditions \nsuch as climate change. With this new approach, the Federal State of Berlin is taking on a pioneering role throughout \nGermany and Europe.\n\nSource:   Berlin Senate Department for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection, Berlin (2019).\n\nSource: EEA, based on Berlin Environmental Atlas.\n\nMitteMitteMitte\n\nLichtenbergLichtenbergLichtenberg\n\nMarzahnHellersdorf\nMarzahn\nHellersdorf\nMarzahn\nHellersdorf\n\nFriedrichshainKreuzberg\n\nFriedrichshainKreuzberg\n\nFriedrichshainKreuzberg\n\nCharlottenburgWilmersdorf\n\nCharlottenburgWilmersdorf\n\nCharlottenburgWilmersdorf\n\nPankowPankowPankow\n\nReinickendorfReinickendorfReinickendorf\n\nSpandauSpandauSpandau\n\nTempelhofSch\u00f6neberg\nTempelhofSch\u00f6neberg\nTempelhofSch\u00f6neberg\n\nNeuk\u00f6llnNeuk\u00f6llnNeuk\u00f6lln\nTreptow-K\u00f6penickTreptow-K\u00f6penickTreptow-K\u00f6penick\n\nSteglitz-ZehlendorfSteglitz-ZehlendorfSteglitz-Zehlendorf\n\nFour times burdened\n\nFive times burdened\n\nDouble burdened\n\nTriple burdened\n\nNo burden\n\nSingle burdened\n\nNo settlement area\n\nHigh noise load\n\nHigh ambient air pollution\n\nLow green space provision\n\nHigh bioclimatic burden\n\nLow social status\n\nIntegrated environmental justice map of Berlin\n\nIntegrated environmental load with social status Multiple burdens\n\nFocus area inner city\n(Priority area for air purity\naccording to land use plan)\n\nBorder of environmental zone\n\nMap 4.11  Integrated environmental justice map of Berlin\n\f\nHealthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe128\n\nFinal reflections\n\n5.1 The environmental burden of disease \nin Europe\n\nToday, the environment is recognised as a \ncore dimension of quality of life. Researchers and \npolicymakers are paying increasing attention to the \ndynamic linkages between the health of populations, \ntheir material living conditions and the environment \nin which they live, work and play. In recognition of \nthis, the European Commission has introduced a \n'zero pollution' ambition to protect citizens' health \nfrom the adverse impacts of environmental pollution, \nincluding air pollution, water pollution, noise and \nchemicals. This provides an impetus for countries to \ncontinue and substantially strengthen activities in these \nareas to address the current impacts that pollution \ncontinues to have on the health and quality of life of \nEuropean\u00a0citizens.\n\nA body of EU legislation is in place to provide Europeans \nwith an environment that can support their quality \nof life and provide essential ecosystem services such \nas drinking water, clean air and safe food, as well \nas sufficient and suitable space for recreation and \nrelaxation. Policies to reduce exposure to environmental \nrisks have delivered substantial gains in terms of \nimproved environmental quality and benefits for health. \nFor example, the quality of drinking water in Europe is \ngenerally very good and directly supports health. Efforts \nare also ongoing to modernise drinking water quality \nstandards, with new controls proposed for emerging \nchemicals. Policies to improve bathing waters have also \nbeen successful, with the majority of Europeans enjoying \ngood recreational bathing conditions.\n\nImprovements in air quality, driven by the measure to \nlimit air pollutant emissions, have delivered significant \nreductions in health impacts in Europe, from around \n1 million premature deaths attributable to particulate \nmatter with a diameter of 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM2.5) in\u00a01990 \nto 417\u00a0000 in 2018. Further reducing PM2.5 concentrations \nwill continue to bring about health benefits and \nreductions in the number of premature deaths.\n\nProgress has not been as positive for all environmental \nrisk factors. For example, the impacts of environmental \n\n5 Final reflections\n\nnoise remain a significant and often underestimated \nburden on the quality of life and health of European \ncitizens. Similarly, the risks presented by poor indoor air \nquality merit further attention. The impacts of climate \nchange on health are predicted to increase significantly \nand will exacerbate the impacts of other environmental \nrisk factors, in particular air pollution.\n\nWhile evidence from human biomonitoring studies \ncarried out across Europe suggests that all people \nhave exogenous chemicals in their bodies, the \nunderstanding of the impacts of chemicals on human \nhealth in Europe is patchy. Nevertheless, approaches \nto regulating groups of chemicals and integrating the \nprinciple of safe by design into production processes \noffer ways of tackling chemical risks. Regarding \nelectromagnetic fields (EMFs), both the potential for \nlong-term health effects and current levels of human \nexposure are not well understood in Europe.\n\nNotwithstanding the achievements in addressing some \nenvironmental risk factors, the environmental burden \nof disease in Europe remains a significant contributor \nto the total burden of disease, with one in eight \ndeaths driven by environmental pollution. There is still \nsubstantial scope for further improvements, both in \nterms of reducing the magnitude of the environmental \nburden of disease and addressing geographical and \nsocial inequity in the distribution of this burden.\n\n5.2 The social dimension\n\nThis report provides evidence of the unequal impact of \nenvironmental pollution and degradation on socially \ndeprived communities and vulnerable groups. While \npolicies to improve environmental quality are in most \ncases delivering positive outcomes for the general \npopulation, vulnerable groups are being left behind.\n\nFor example, the health impacts associated with air \npollution are unevenly distributed across Europe, \nwith exposure to PM2.5 shortening lives in eastern \nand southern Europe and exposure to nitrogen \ndioxide (NO2) shortening lives in the west of Europe. \nIn addition, a growing body of evidence indicates \n\f\nFinal reflections\n\n129Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\nthat health impacts of air pollution are unevenly \ndistributed across social groups. Children, pregnant \nwomen and the elderly are more sensitive to the health \nimpacts of various air pollutants, with the impacts \non children's cognitive development having lifelong \nimplications. In terms of exposure, studies have found \nthat deprived urban communities face higher levels of \nair pollution than wealthier urban areas, leading to an \nincreased health burden that may be exacerbated by \npre-existing health conditions, with a higher prevalence \nin poorer communities.\n\nWhile chemicals are regulated under a comprehensive \nrange of policies, there is no overarching approach that \naddresses the reality of everyday exposure to the many \nand complex mixtures of chemicals. Individual chemical \nexposure is influenced by personal behaviours, diet and \nconsumer choices, some of which are mediated by social \nstatus. Understanding the drivers behind exposure to \nspecific chemicals can inform measures to minimising \nexposures, in particular for vulnerable groups such as \npregnant women and children.\n\nPolicies to deliver high environmental quality should \nbe aimed at preventing and reducing the unequal \ndistribution of environmental health risks, ensuring \nfair access to environmental resources and enabling \nsustainable choices. A first step would be to integrate \nthese goals into environmental legislation, such as the \nagendas for climate change and air pollution. Universal \nmeasures to deliver overall reductions in exposure \nfor the general population can be complemented by \nmeasures targeted at groups known to be vulnerable in \nterms of their increased exposure, increased sensitivity \nor reduced resilience.\n\nA second step would be to integrate the concept of \nenvironmental inequity into other policy domains. \nAt European level, options exist to explicitly target \nsocio-environmental inequalities through the EU \nCohesion Fund and the European Social Fund, since \nenvironmental inequalities follow the pattern of \nsocio-demographic inequalities across Europe. This could \nbe achieved through funding to improve environmental \nquality in disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods and \nto enable people to make more sustainable choices, \nfor example by subsidising clean fuels. At the local \nlevel, integrating environmental health concerns into \nwelfare policies, health policies and urban planning can \nhelp to reduce the vulnerability and exposure of the \npopulation. The World Health Organization Regional \nOffice for Europe has produced guidance on how to \nmonitor, assess and manage environmental health \ninequalities (WHO Europe, 2019d). An example of action \nto understand and tackle environmental justice in \nGermany is provided in Box\u00a05.1, together with emerging \nrecommendations for local authorities. \n\n5.3 Integrated policies for the \nenvironment, health and well-being\n\nHistorically, policies to control environmental risks to \nhealth focused narrowly on single stressors, for example \nthose aiming to reduce population level exposure to air \npollution. In reality, multiple stressors act together to \nlead to a deterioration in quality of life, in combination \nwith social deprivation and demographic factors.\n\nThe systemic links between community health, social \ncontext and the local environment offer opportunities \nfor synergies when designing interventions to improve \nquality of life across these dimensions. This requires \nintegrated policy approaches that take into account \ndimensions of environmental quality as well as social \nfactors such as economic circumstances, behaviours and \ndemographics. In particular, understanding behaviours \nand the underlying mechanisms across different groups \nis important in designing measures that can support and \nenable people to make sustained positive changes, such \nas dietary shifts, increased exercise and reduced car use. \nIn some cases, changes may be inhibited by poverty, such \nas switching from solid fuel use for residential heating to \ncleaner fuels and consuming more vegetables. Targeted \nsubsidies coupled with education/awareness raising \ncan support behavioural changes that benefit both the \nenvironment and health, particularly among poorer \ncommunities (Inherit, 2019b).\n\nEnvironmental health issues can also be addressed \nthrough health policies. The health-in-all-policies \napproach tackles the environmental, economic and \nsocial determinants of health. Given the benefits \nof social expenditure on prevention in reducing health \ninequalities, it is significant that only 3\u00a0% of the EU health \nbudgets are spent on prevention (Eurostat, 2019a). A \nspecific objective of the EU's third health programme \n(2014-2020), 'Funding Health Initiatives', is promoting \nhealth, preventing disease and fostering supportive \nenvironments for healthy lifestyles (EU,\u00a02014). Integrating \nenvironmental quality objectives into preventive \nhealth policies offers opportunities to reduce disease \nand promote well-being. An example of cross-agency \ncollaboration to deliver environmental health in Sweden \nis presented in Box 5.2.\n\nHigh-quality natural environments offer significant \nbenefits for local communities in terms of healthier \nliving, both physically and mentally. In particular, \never-increasing urbanisation combines dense \npopulations, often with high proportions of elderly \npeople, with exposure to multiple environmental \nstressors, including air pollution, noise and heat. Failure \nto address the environmental risk factors associated with \nurbanisation will have significant implications for future \ngenerations.\n\f\nFinal reflections\n\n130 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 5.1  Research and action on environmental justice in Germany\n\nThe German Environment Agency has worked extensively on the uneven distribution of environmental resources and \nexposure to environmental pressures and the implications for health. Funded by the German Environment Agency, \nfrom 2012 to 2014 the German Institute of Urban Affairs (Difu) carried out the research project 'Environmental justice in \nurban areas \u2014 development of feasible strategies and measures to reduce socially unequally distributed health-related \nenvironmental burden'. This explored how local authorities can be supported in their activities to create environmental \njustice at a local level. The following recommendations for municipalities were developed (B\u00f6hme et al., 2015).\n\nIntegrated governance: the study shows that coordinated action by all relevant departments and stakeholders is \nindispensable. This requires, in particular, a greater socio-spatial orientation of the local environment and health \ndepartments.\n\nIntegrated monitoring: a two-stage procedure was proposed, consisting of a citywide analysis and a more in-depth \ninvestigation of areas identified as being subject to multiple burdens in the first step. The approach requires the combined \nuse of environmental, health and social data. A selection of basic and more detailed indicators is provided for orientation.\n\nFormulation of objectives and measures: it is essential to determine the area-related need for action. Links \u2014 e.g. for \ninclusion in integrated urban development concepts \u2014 should be identified.\n\nUse of planning instruments and instruments in environmental law: a set of instruments appropriate to the planning \narea concerned must be applied. In environmental planning, for example, a systematic check for socio-spatially oriented \npriorities would be beneficial.\n\nUse of financial resources: funding from support programmes should be targeted at areas with multiple burdens. The \nperformance of pilot projects would make it possible to test the practicality of the approaches developed in the project.\n\nParticipation and involvement of those affected: appropriate citizen participation in the planning and decision-making \nprocesses is important. This should include methods that engage socially disadvantaged people.\n\nThe first research project was followed up with a pilot project in German municipalities, run by Difu from 2015 to 2019 and \nfunded by the German Environment Agency. It aimed to prevent and reduce the unequal distribution of environmental \nhealth risks. The pilot project tested the recommendations outlined above in three pilot municipalities: Kassel, Marburg and \nMunich. The project identified measures suitable for promoting environmental justice and how they might be integrated into \nongoing activities at municipal level and mainstreamed politically. It also considered how to identify urban areas exposed \nto multiple burdens. The assessment found different opportunities for promoting environmental justice in individual \ntowns and cities. Success factors included scrutinising strategies linked to environmental justice, securing backing from \nlocal politicians, identifying an 'advocate' in the administration to lead the issue and ensuring cooperation across different \ndepartmental bodies at the strategic and working levels (B\u00f6hme et al., 2019).\n\nAgainst the background of the project's findings, the online toolbox 'Environmental Justice'  \n(www.toolbox-umweltgerechtigkeit.de) was created to support municipalities, including providing definitions, \nbackground information, checklists, advice on implementation and practical examples.\n\nhttp://www.toolbox-umweltgerechtigkeit.de\f\nFinal reflections\n\n131Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 5.2  Delivering environmental health through collaboration in Sweden\n\nCross-sectoral collaboration on environmental health in Sweden \nIn 2017, the Swedish Public Health Agency initiated a collaboration involving 13 national and two regional agencies in the project \n'Health as a driving force for the environmental objectives and for sustainable development'. The project was set up under the \nEnvironmental Objectives Council, a body that includes representation from 18 national agencies involved in delivering Sweden's \nenvironmental objectives. These agencies work with a wide array of sectors, including transport, forestry, agriculture, public \nhealth, marine, energy, housing and planning, food, chemistry, geology, radiation and environment.\n\nCollaboration across national bodies enabled access to a richer knowledge base and a broader set of perspectives, providing a \nbetter basis for decision-making. It also informed efforts to influence decisions in the international arena through cross-sectoral \nmessages. Local and regional actors were able to identify and harness synergies across policy domains for environment and \nhealth.\n\nOpportunities to strengthening environmental health in Sweden \nThe project identified opportunities to work more efficiently on environmental health in Sweden. The strength of the outcome \nresulted from the unified voice of the many sectors involved, recognizing and harnessing the diversity of perspectives and \nknowledge. The project identified opportunities to:\n\n\u2022 Emphasize health as a driving force across policies and a common goal;\n\n\u2022 Raise the profile of health aspects that represent common priorities for several sectors and actors;\n\n\u2022 Highlight the benefits associated with the environment, and not only environmental risks;\n\n\u2022 Consider equity issues when planning actions on environmental health; \n\n\u2022 Strengthen collaboration in environmental health.\n\nEstablishing a national network to strengthen environmental health \nThe success of the collaboration was primarily due to the mandate given by the Environmental Objectives Council. This raised \nthe issue of health as a driving force for environmental work at the agencies involved, and ensured that resources were set aside \nfor collaboration. In follow up, Sweden is establishing a national network for environmental health, including the government \nagencies involved in the project and other relevant actors, to be coordinated by Sweden's Public Health Agency.\n\nProposed joint actions \nJoint actions proposed for the network to implement include:\n\n\u2022 A national portfolio of actions on environmental health in accordance with the Ostrava Declaration (WHO Europe, 2017a);\n\n\u2022 Analyses of the socio-economic dimension in environmental health, in order to prioritize resource allocation;\n\n\u2022 A coordinated national study of environmental health; \n\n\u2022 The development of indicators to measure health equity;\n\n\u2022 The use of foresight tools to understand future environmental health;\n\n\u2022 Mapping international processes on environmental health where Swedish agencies participate. \n \n\nSource:   Private communication from the Public Health Agency of Sweden. \n\f\nFinal reflections\n\n132 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n5.4 A triple win for the environment, \nhealth and society\n\nUnderstanding how social status mediates the \nenvironment, health and well-being nexus through both \npositive and negative pathways present an opportunity \nto pursue joint solutions. Investing in nature offers a \ntriple win, yielding benefits for the environment, health \nand society (Inherit, 2019b).\n\nGreen infrastructure in urban areas mitigates stressors \nsuch as noise, extreme heat and to a lesser extent \nair pollution, increases resilience to climate-related \nfloods and promotes urban biodiversity. In addition, \ngreen spaces in urban areas providing public space \nfor relaxation and exercise facilitate community \ninteractions and so reduce social isolation, a risk factor \nfor adverse health outcomes. Deprived communities \nderive particular benefit from nature in terms of \nmental health, as well as reductions in mortality and \nmorbidity, implying that green and blue spaces can be \na tool in tackling pervasive health inequities. Migrant \nand marginalised communities find opportunities to \nintegrate with local communities in parks and urban \ngreen spaces, fostering a sense of belonging. As a \nresult, urban green space offers municipalities a tool \nfor delivering a triple win, offering benefits to health, \nsociety and the environment.\n\nAn integrated approach also highlights opportunities \nto tackle multiple stressors with common sources. \nFor example, clean and smart transport solutions \nin urban areas can deliver benefits in terms of \ncleaner air, less noise and reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions. In addition, reduced congestion combined \nwith improved infrastructure for walking and cycling \nencourages physical activity. Providing mobility \noptions for the 'first mile' and 'last mile' of journeys \ntaken by public transport increases the connectivity \nof urban transport solutions, making active and \nsustainable transport modes more attractive (EEA, \n2020c). In a context in which approximately two thirds \nof people in the EU fail to achieve the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) recommendations for physical \nactivity (Eurostat, 2018c) \u2014 as sedentary lifestyles \nare a key driver of non-communicable diseases \u2014 \npromoting exercise is a public health priority.\n\nAnother example relates to the food system, critical \nto human nutrition, as well as livelihoods and culture. \nUnsustainable agriculture leads to the pollution of \nsoil, water, air and food, degrades ecosystems and \ndrives biodiversity loss, with knock-on effects on \nhuman health. For example, ammonia emissions \nfrom agriculture, in particular animal manure, \ncontribute to the formation of PM in ambient air, \nwhile pesticide use reduces pollinator populations \n\nand leaves residues in foods. At the same time, an \nunhealthy diet that is high in animal protein, sugar \nand fats, combined with low levels of exercise, \nleads to people becoming overweight or obese, \nincreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain \ntypes of cancer, hypertension and type\u00a02 diabetes. \nMeat and dairy products contribute around 25\u00a0% \nof the environmental impacts caused by total final \nconsumption of products in the EU, with livestock \nbeing more than six times less efficient than crops in \nproducing protein. Dietary shifts towards consuming \nlower quantities of meat, dairy products and eggs \nwould reduce environmental impacts as well as \nreduce health risks. At the same time, ensuring that \nthe food system contributes positively to social wellbeing in Europe means providing viable and just \nlivelihoods for farmers, fishers and other workers \ninvolved in the food system (EEA, 2017c).\n\n5.5 Systemic challenges and trade-offs \nacross policy domains\n\nPersistent environmental pollution and degradation \nresults from environmental pressures, such as \ngreenhouse gas emissions, industrial air and water \nemissions, waste generation and land clearance. These \npressures are driven by our economic activities and \nlifestyle demands, in particular the societal systems that \nprovide our energy, food and mobility. The systemic \ncharacter of Europe's environmental challenges explains \nwhy policies designed to address environmental \nstressors in isolation have only been partly successful. \nEnvironmental impacts remain high and current trends \nare not on track to achieve long-term environmental and \nsustainability goals (EEA,\u00a02019a).\n\nShifting the policy focus towards sustainability, to deliver \npositive outcomes for the environment, health and \nsociety, requires common goals across policy areas. It \nrequires an awareness of the need for trade-offs across \npolicy domains when priorities conflict, presenting \nchallenges to developing integrated solutions.\n\nFor example, climate change objectives can conflict \nwith efforts to reduce air pollution. Insulating buildings \nto reduce energy loss can limit ventilation, leading to \npoor indoor air quality if the buildings are not properly \ndesigned. Measures that incentivise the use of biomass \nfor home heating can negatively have an impact on \nindoor and outdoor air quality and damage health.\n\nCurrent efforts to shift towards a circular economy offer \nthe potential to reduce the impacts of our production \nand consumption systems, with potential benefits \nfor health. However, there is a need to consider the \npotential impacts on health and well-being when \n\f\nFinal reflections\n\n133Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\ndeveloping and implementing circularity, to avoid \nnegative outcomes. For example, in promoting recycling, \nthere is a need to ensure that hazardous chemicals are \nnot channelled into, and in some cases magnified in, \nsecondary products, leading to human exposure. Impact \nassessments provide a means for integrating health \nconcerns when considering circularity options, with a \nrange of health-related assessment methods available \n(WHO Europe, 2019c). \n\nIn terms of priorities in the health sector, \npharmaceuticals are used extensively to treat disease, \nsupport recovery and maintain good health. At the same \ntime, releasing pharmaceuticals into the environment \nvia waste water treatment plants has an impact on \necosystems. In the case of antibiotics, releasing them \ninto the environment drives the development of \nbacteria, viruses and some parasites that are resistant \nto antimicrobial drugs. In turn, antimicrobial resistance \npresents a major threat to the effective prevention and \ntreatment of a range of infections and is a serious threat \nto public health.\n\nMore broadly, economic growth is the principal driver of \npoverty alleviation. Yet, the current pattern of economic \ngrowth is driven by unsustainable consumption \nand production \u2014 the root cause of environmental \ndegradation.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented society with a tradeoff between protecting health and maintaining economic \ngrowth. The immediacy of the threat resulted in rapid \naction to protect health in many countries and regions. \nThe threats that environmental degradation and climate \nchange pose to human health are no less profound but \nthe impacts manifest over longer timescales through \ncomplex dynamics. Addressing these risks requires \nsystemic change through visionary policies implemented \nover the long term and supported by transparent and \nscience-based public discourse.\n\n5.6 Research needs in the environment, \nhealth and well-being nexus\n\nThere is sufficient evidence available to support policy \nactions to improve the environment, health and \nwell-being. A lack of knowledge should not be used to \njustify inaction.\n\nEnvironmental health practitioners should avoid \ngetting lost in complexity when looking for clear \ndirections for action. It is unlikely that we will ever be \nable to map all the complex, cumulative exposures \nof the European population, untangle the influence \nof social dimensions and establish causal links to \nhealth outcomes. Clear opportunities to address \nindividual environmental risk factors should be taken \nwithout delay, while also taking into consideration \ntheir potential impact on other stressors and, where \npossible, adjusting existing policy measures to \naddress multiple stressors through innovative and \nintegrated approaches. The precautionary principle \nprovides a basis for action, to protect health and the \nenvironment on the basis of early evidence of harm.\n\nAt the same time, there are specific environmental \nrisk factors and emerging issues of concern that \nwarrant further attention from researchers. In \nparticular, the environment and health community \nwould benefit from greater clarity regarding the \nlinkages between the environment, social and health \ndimensions, including the influence of social status, \nbehaviours and consumer choices.\n\nResearch designed to deliver societal benefits should \ninvestigate and disseminate social and technological \ninnovations that can support improvements in \nenvironmental health.\n\nThe research needed to address current knowledge \ngaps is outlined in Box 5.3.\n\f\nFinal reflections\n\n134 Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 5.3  Research needs in the field of the environment, health and well-being\n\nKnowledge gaps regarding environmental impacts on health\n\n\u2022 Further analysis is required on a European scale to understand regional differences in environmental quality and the \ndrivers that lie behind those differences.\n\n\u2022 Regarding air pollution, the quality of indoor air across Europe is poorly understood and would benefit from further \nresearch. A particular focus could be on the school environment.\n\n\u2022 Current approaches to estimating the health impacts of air pollution operate at population level and focus on \npremature mortality. It would be useful to understand the health impacts of air pollution in local areas, capturing both \nmortality and morbidity effects. The latter could be linked to hospitalisation rates during peaks in air pollution.\n\n\u2022 Further knowledge is needed to understand exposure to multiple stressors in urban areas, their relative importance \nand resulting health impacts. This could include efforts to map multiple exposures across different scales, as well \nas methods to measure the individual exposures described above. For example, there is a need for an enhanced \nunderstanding of how air pollution and noise combine to affect health. Another area with open questions is the role \nthat climate change plays in exacerbating other environmental stressors, such as air pollution and the risks posed by \nchemical stressors.\n\n\u2022 The potential for long-term health impacts of and exposure to electromagnetic fields remain poorly understood. \n\n\u2022 Further work is needed to understand the prevalence of microplastics in the environment and the potential impacts \non\u00a0food, drinking water and health.\n\n\u2022 Regarding chemicals, the HBM4EU (a) project is expected to yield the first European data set on human exposure \nto chemicals. Further work should investigate trends in exposure over time, to evaluate policy measures to reduce \nexposure. Non-targeted screening is essential for identifying known, emerging and unknown contaminants in the \nhuman population, as well as in environmental media.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of agro-chemicals, including pesticides and fertilisers, on ecosystem services such as pollination and the \nprovision of clean drinking water are poorly understood.\n\nResearch needs on the environmental health dimensions of COVID-19 \n\n\u2022 There is a need to better understand the role that environmental degradation plays in driving the emergence of \nzoonotic disease, including deforestation and habitat fragmentation, for example through increased surveillance of \nzoonotic disease across different habitats. Research should also explore the upstream drivers of habitat degradation, \nincluding intensive agriculture, mining and urban development. \n\n\u2022 Research should focus on how human-animal interactions in the food system, in particular in intensive meat \nproduction, can led to the emergence of zoonotic disease. \n\n\u2022 Further research is needed to explore the role that air pollution may play in influencing the transmission and severity of \nCOVID-19. This includes an assessment of how long-term exposure to key pollutants may have influenced the COVID-19 \ndeath rate, based on comparable data, where possible. Research should seek to elucidate the mechanisms through \nwhich long-term exposure may weaken the immune defenses of the lungs and increase susceptibility to respiratory \ninfection.\n\n\u2022 The potential association between social deprivation and vulnerability to COVID-19, and in particular the role of higher \nlevels of exposure to air pollution in poorer communities, requires further research. \n\n\u2022 The question of whether PM can act as a carrier for the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be explored.\n\nKnowledge gaps regarding the social dimension\n\n\u2022 There is a need to better understand the role that social status plays in determining exposure to environmental risks, \nand in influencing sensitivity and resilience. \n\n\u2022 Further investigation is needed into how access to green and blue spaces is developing and changing across Europe \nand into the key national drivers of these changes.\n\f\nFinal reflections\n\n135Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe\n\n \nBox 5.3  Research needs in the field of the environment, health and well-being (cont.)\n\n\u2022 A better understanding of the role that housing quality plays in increasing exposure to environmental stressors, \nincluding noise, indoor air pollution and chemicals, is needed.\n\n\u2022 It will be important to explore how shifting demographics in Europe may lead to a greater vulnerability to \nenvironmental stressors, through increased sensitivity and reduced resilience.\n\n\u2022 The Copernicus Urban Atlas data can be used to assess the spatial distributions of populations and green areas in \nurban areas across Europe. There are opportunities to assess how socio-economic status might affect access to green \nspace in urban areas and high-quality environments outside cities, such as national parks, by mapping data provided \nunder the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service against available socio-economic data on different scales.\n\nSolution-oriented research\n\n\u2022 It will be important to report on and share case studies that provide concrete evidence of how nature-based solutions \ncan deliver a triple win at local, national and European scales.\n\n\u2022 Research could usefully test and recommend innovative measures to manage the impact of climate change. This may \ninclude looking into the role of green infrastructure in adapting to predicted changes to the hydrogeological cycle that \nare expected to impact on surface water, drinking water and bathing water quality.\n\n\u2022 Evidence of the health and social benefits of green and blue spaces and recommendations for how to foster behaviours \nto increase the use of green and blue spaces should be gathered.\n\n\u2022 A better understanding of how the human microbiome is influenced after time spent in natural environments and the \nsubsequent benefits for the immune system is needed.\n\n\u2022 It is important to report on best practice in implementing policies that integrate environmental, health and social \nconcerns in the urban context, including the governance approaches needed to build consensus across policy domains \nand drive implementation. \n\nMethodological approaches\n\n\u2022 Undertaking analyses of different types of data \u2014 including information on social and demographic status, health and \nenvironmental quality \u2014 can help to identify linkages across these domains on European, national and local scales. The \nchallenge is to identify data sets that cover the same scale and time frame and so can be meaningfully combined. \n\n\u2022 Combining data on environmental quality with health data on various spatial scales could yield valuable insights \nregarding associations between exposure and health outcomes.\n\n\u2022 Innovative tools and methods are being deployed to measure environmental exposures at an individual level, which can \nbe combined with data on socio-economic status and behaviour. The exposome provides a tool for mapping exposures \nalong the lifecycle and teasing out links with social status and behaviours. This has the potential to yield large data sets \nthat are valuable for exploring the drivers of single and multiple exposures and the impacts on health.\n\n\u2022 Cohort studies are well suited to exploring the role that exposure to environmental risks and access to environmental \nbenefits play as a health determinant along the lifespan of an individual.\n\n\u2022 Citizen science, whereby the public contributes to data gathering, offers new opportunities for monitoring local \nenvironments. Data generated by citizen science can pose challenges in terms of robustness and spatial coverage; \nfurther reflection on how they might be best combined with the results of coordinated monitoring activities is required. \nSuch an initiative fosters public engagement with environmental issues, with impacts on local social and environmental \nconditions being worthy of exploration.\n\nNote: (a)

This has a critical impact \non the conservation status of wetland \nhabitats and the species that depend \non them. Although point source \npollution, nitrogen surpluses and \nwater abstraction have been reduced, \nfreshwaters continue to be affected by \ndiffuse pollution, hydromorphological \nchanges and water abstraction. \n\n\u2022 Diffuse pollution and water \nabstraction pressures are expected \nto continue in response to intensive \nagricultural practices and energy \nproduction. This requires balancing \nsocietal demands for water with \nensuring its availability for nature. \nClimate change is likely to change the \namount of water available regionally, \nincreasing the need for either flood \nprotection or drought management \nand making this balance more difficult \nto achieve. \n\n\u2022 Improved implementation and \nincreased coherence between EU \nwater-related policy objectives and \nmeasures is needed to improve \nwater quality and quantity. Looking \nahead it will also become increasingly \ncritical to address and monitor the \nclimate-water-ecosystem-agriculture \nnexus and connection with energy \nneeds. \n\n\u2022 It is on the river basin scale \nthat effective solutions for water \nmanagement can be found and \nessential knowledge is being developed \nthrough the implementation of river \nbasin management plans under \nthe Water Framework Directive. \nSolutions such as natural water \nretention measures, buffer strips, \nsmart water pricing, more efficient \nirrigation techniques and precision \nagriculture will continue to grow in \nimportance. An ecosystem-based \nmanagement approach, considering \nmultiple environmental objectives and \nco-benefits to society and the economy, \nwill further support progress.\n\nKey messages\n\nThematic summary assessment\n\nNote: For the methodology of the summary assessment table, see the introduction to Part 2.

Ensuring \nthat enough water of high quality is \navailable for all purposes, including \nfor water and wetland ecosystems, \nremains a key challenge globally and \nwithin Europe. Europe\u2019s waters and \nwetlands remain under pressure from \nwater pollution from nutrients and \nhazardous substances, overabstraction \nof water and physical changes. Climate \nchange is expected to exacerbate many \nof these pressures, which depending on \nthe pressure, may act on groundwater, \nrivers, lakes, transitional and coastal \nwaters, as well as the riparian zone and \nwetlands. In return, this reduces the \nquality of the natural services provided \nby those ecosystems (Figure 4.1). \n\nThe remaining challenge is to further \nreduce the many pressures on \nwater. These are linked to intensive \n\nagriculture, as well as other human \nuses that are economically important, \nbut unfortunately also add large \npressures to the environment. \nImproving water status will support \nimprovements in biodiversity (Chapter \n3) and in the marine environment \n(Chapter 6). Finally,\u00a0Europe indirectly \nuses freshwater resources in countries \noutside its boundaries by importing \ngoods with water-intensive production \nchains (Chapter 1).\n\n4.2 \nPolicy context\n\nEurope\u2019s water policy has developed \ngradually over the last few decades. \nThe first EU policies aiming to improve \nwater quality date back to 1991, with \nthe adoption of the Urban Waste Water \nTreatment and Nitrates Directives \n(EU, 1991a, 1991b), both targeting \n(among other things) reducing pollution \npressures on water. In 2000, with the \nadoption of the Water Framework \nDirective (EU, 2000), an integrated \necosystem-based approach to managing \nwater was introduced. Public safety \nand health objectives were secured \nby the Drinking Water, Bathing Water \nand Floods Directives (EU, 1998, 2006, \n2007), and presently a proposal on the \nminimum requirements for water reuse \nis under discussion. While the directives \ntend to be very specific, the importance \nof water in relation to biodiversity and \nmarine policies is pursued through \nthe EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 \n(EC, 2011a) and the priority objectives \nof the Seventh Environment Action \n\nEurope\u2019s waters are affected \nby pressures from pollution, \noverabstraction and physical \n\nchanges. \n\f\n96 SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nFIGURE 4.1  Selection of links between drivers, pressures, condition, ecosystem services and policy objectives\n\nDrivers\n(human activities)\n\nPressures Condition/Status Ecosystem\nservices\n\nPolicy\nobjectives\n\nWater\nuse\n\n Agricultural \nproduction\n\nFlood\nprotection\n\nHydropower\n\nWater\nstorage\n\nPorts and\nnavigation\n\n \n\nWater\nabstraction\n\nNutrient\npollution\n\nChemical\npollution\n\nHydromorphological \npressures\n\nAlien species \nintroduction\n\nEcological\nstatus\n\nSurface water \nchemical status\n\nGroundwater \nchemical status\n\nGroundwater \nquantitative status\n\nDrinking\nwater quality\n\nFloodplain and \nwetland condition\n\nClean water\nfor all purposes \n\nNutrient\nretention\n\nQuality of aquatic \necosystems\n\nWater retention\nand flood control\n\nGroundwater \nrecharge and\nwater storage\n\nClean and safe \ndrinking water\n\nSustainable use of \nwater\n\nGood status of \nsurface and \n\ngroundwater\n \n\nReduced  nitrates \npollution\n\nFlood protection\n\nProtection of\nspecies\n\nand habitats\n\nProgramme, or 7th EAP (EU, 2013a). \nWater quantity remains an area \nof national competence, although \nissues linked to overall sustainable \nwater use are of transboundary and \nthus European interest (EC, 2011b). \nEEA\u00a0member countries that are \nnot Member States of the EU also \nimplement water policies inspired \nby the Water Framework and Floods \nDirectives.

Hence, achieving good \nstatus of Europe\u2019s surface waters not \nonly serves the objective of providing \nclean water but also supports the \nobjective of providing better conditions \nfor some of Europe\u2019s most endangered \necosystems, habitats and species, as listed \nunder the Habitats and Birds Directives. \nUnfortunately, however, both surface \nwater ecosystems and wetlands are under \nconsiderable pressure. \n\nTrends in the ecological status \nof\u00a0water\n\nThe quality of surface water ecosystems \nis assessed as ecological status under \nthe Water Framework Directive. \nThe ecological status assessment is \nperformed for 111\u00a0000 water bodies in \nEurope and it is based on assessments \nof individual biological quality elements \nand supporting physico-chemical and \nhydromorphological quality elements \n(definitions can be found in EEA, 2018b \nand Section 4.3.2). A recent compilation \nof national assessments, done as part of \nthe second river basin management plans \nrequired under the Water Framework \nDirective (EEA, 2018b; EC,\u00a02019), shows \nthat 40\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s surface water \nbodies achieve good ecological status\u00a0(1). \nThis is the same share of water bodies \nachieving good status as reported in \nthe first river basin management plans. \nLakes and coastal waters tend to achieve \nbetter ecological status than rivers and \ntransitional waters, and natural water \nbodies are generally found to have better \necological status than the ecological \npotential found for heavily modified or \nartificial ones. Across Europe, there is a \ndifference between river basin districts in \ndensely populated central Europe, where \na high proportion of water bodies do not \nachieve good ecological status, and those \nin northern Scandinavia, Scotland and \n\nsome eastern European and southern \nriver basin districts, where more tend to \nachieve good ecological status (Map 4.1). \n\nThe ecological status assessment is based \non the \u2018one out, all out principle\u2019, i.e. if \none assessed element of quality fails to \nachieve good status, the overall result is \nless than good status. Thus, the status \nof individual quality elements may be \nbetter than the overall status. Overall, \nfor rivers, 50-70\u00a0% of classified water \nbodies have high or good status for \nseveral quality elements, whereas only \n40\u00a0% of rivers achieve good ecological \nstatus or better. Since the first river basin \nmanagement plans, many more individual \nquality elements have been monitored, \nimproving the confidence of assessments, \neven if the variability of methods used \nby Member States remains so large \nthat comparisons have to be made with \ncaution (Table 4.2).\n\nTrends in wetlands\n\nAcross Europe, wetlands are being \nlost. Between the years 2000 and 2018 \nthe already small area of wetlands \ndecreased further by approximately 1\u00a0% \n(Chapter 5). Many wetlands are found \nin undisturbed floodplains, the areas \nnext to the river covered by water during \nfloods. Scientific estimates suggest that \n70-90\u00a0% of floodplains are degraded \n(Tockner and Stanford, 2002; EEA,\u00a02016). \n\nAs a consequence, the capacity of \nfloodplains to deliver important and \nvaluable ecosystem services linked to \nflood protection and healthy functioning \nof river ecosystems has been reduced, \nultimately reducing their capacity to \nsupport achieving good ecological and \nconservation status. The conservation \nstatus of many freshwater habitats and \nspecies listed in the Habitats and Birds \nDirectives is not changing, and it remains \npredominantly unfavourable or bad \n(Table 4.2). The habitat group \u2018Bogs, mires \nand fens\u2019 (different wetland types) has \nthe highest proportion of unfavourable \nassessments \u2014 almost 75\u00a0% (Chapter\u00a03). \nThe group \u2018Freshwater habitats\u2019 is also \npredominantly unfavourable, as are \nassessments of amphibians (Chapter 3).\n\nPressures and driving forces\n\nThe main reasons for not achieving \ngood ecological status are linked to \nhydromorphological pressures\u00a0(40\u00a0%), \ndiffuse pollution (38\u00a0%) and water \nabstraction (Section 4.4). The \nunderstanding of the links between \nstatus and pressures has improved \nwith the development of river basin \nmanagement plans, and it is expected \nthat the implementation of the Water \nFramework Directive will increasingly \nlead to a reduction in the most critical \npressures and thus to improved \necological status of surface water bodies \n(Table 4.2). Freshwater habitats are \nsubject to many of the same pressures \nas surface water bodies, and they are \noften very sensitive to overabstraction \nof water. In reporting under the \nHabitats Directive for freshwater \nhabitats, changes in hydrology are \nmost frequently reported as being \nimportant, as is \u2018pollution to surface \nwaters\u2019 \u00a0Chapter 3).

If they are designated as \nNatura 2000 sites, freshwater habitats \nand wetlands are protected through \nthe associated management plans. An \nanalysis of the share of inland surface \nwater covered by protected areas \nshowed that in the majority of European \ncountries it is above the 17\u00a0% protection \nlevel set out in Aichi biodiversity \ntarget\u00a011 (Bastin et\u00a0al., 2019).\n\n4.3.2 \nHydromorphological pressures \n\u25baSee\u00a0Table\u00a04.3 \n \nHydromorphology is considered a \nkey parameter, because interaction \nbetween water, morphology, sediments \nand vegetation creates habitats that \ndetermine the river\u2019s ecological status. \nHydromorphological pressures\u00a0(2) \n\nare one of the main reasons that \nsurface water bodies fail to achieve \ngood ecological status; it is listed as a \nsignificant pressure for 40\u00a0% of surface \nwater bodies (see sheet \u2018SWB pressures\u2019 \nin EEA, 2018e). Most of these pressures \nstem from physical alteration of river \nchannels or of the riparian zone or shore \nor from dams, locks and other barriers. \n\nThese pressures occur because both \nthe river and its floodplains are subject \nto a multitude of human uses that have \naltered their hydrology, morphology \nand connectivity as well as catchment \nland use over centuries. These uses are \ndiverse and include increasing efforts \nto straighten rivers to make them \nnavigable, drainage to gain agricultural \nland, urban development, and the \nneed for ports, flood protection, water \nstorage, hydropower and cooling water \n(Table 4.3). Transversal structures in \nparticular (e.g. dams, weirs or locks) act \nas barriers for movement of sediment \nand biota. They also hamper the \npassage of fish, which is particularly \nimportant for the life cycles of eel, \nsturgeon or salmon because migration \nis part of their reproductive cycles. \nFish are one of the biological quality \nelements assessed in rivers under the \nWater Framework Directive. Lateral \n\n(2) Hydromorphology is the geomorphological and hydrological characteristic of a water body, which is also a condition for its ecosystem. \nHydromorphological pressures are changes in the natural water body due to the human need to control flow, erosion and floods, as well as to \ndrainage, river straightening and harbour construction.\u00a0\n\nPast trends and outlook\n\nPast trends \n(10-15 years)\n\nThere has been mixed progress with 40 % of Europe\u2019s surface waters in good ecological status and some \nimprovements in individual biological quality elements observed in the past 6 years. The conservation \nstatus of freshwater protected habitats and species is not changing, and remains predominantly \nunfavourable or bad.\n\nOutlook to 2030 Continued progress is expected as implementation of the Water Framework Directive continues. \nImplementation of available provisions within the Water Framework, Floods, Habitats and Birds Directives to \nimprove the conservation status of water-dependent habitats and species, by increasing the area of natural \nfloodplains and wetlands, will be required to deliver improvements. \n\nProspects of meeting policy objectives/targets\n\n2020\n\n\uf053\n\nEurope is not on track to meet the objective of achieving good ecological status for all surface waters by 2020.\n\nEurope is not on track to meet the 2020 target of improving the conservation status of protected species and \nhabitats (bogs, mires, fens, freshwater habitats and amphibians) and the cumulative pressures remain high. \n\nRobustness The EEA has collated EU Member States\u2019 assessments made under the Water Framework Directive. While each \nassessment is based on observations and can be considered robust, differences between approaches among \nEU Member States make comparisons challenging. The considerable loss of floodplains and wetlands is well \ndocumented. Outlooks are based primarily on expert judgement and assume that management implemented \nunder EU policies will be effective and lead to some improvement. Knowledge gaps remain large for habitats \nand species not directly encompassed by EU legislation.\n\nEurope is unlikely to achieve \ngood ecological status for all \nsurface waters by 2020.\n\f\n101SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nconnectivity between the river and its \nfloodplain is also of critical importance, \nenabling floodplains to retain \nwater for natural flood protection \n(EEA,\u00a0forthcoming). \n\nIt is difficult to assess trends in \nhydromorphological pressures based \non information reported under the \nWater Framework Directive because \nthe categorisation of those pressures \nhas changed between the reporting \nof the first and second river basin \nmanagement plans, and no alternative \nmethod exists. However, EU Member \nStates, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey \nare developing methods for assessing \nhydromorphological status (Kampa \nand Bussettini, 2018). At present, \n55\u00a0different assessment methods are in \nuse across Europe aiming to evaluate \nthe impacts of hydromorphological \npressures on the status of water \n\nbodies. Relevant measures needed \nto achieve good ecological status or \npotential are also considered as part of \nthat work.\n\nDrivers of change and solutions\n\nAwareness is increasing of the \nimportant regulating ecosystem \nservices provided by surface waters, \nfloodplains and wetlands that have \nmaintained their natural state to a high \ndegree. Particularly important is the \nabsence of barriers to fish migration, \ni.e. longitudinal connectivity, and the \nability of floodplains to retain and filter \nwater and nutrients, i.e. horizontal \nconnectivity (Box 4.1). Fragmentation \nof rivers and of riparian habitats also \nhas an impact on invertebrates and \nmammals. With the introduction of \nriver basin and flood risk management \n\nplans, planning tools that support river \nrestoration initiatives are in place and \nshould ensure that more effort is made \nto restore Europe\u2019s rivers in the future. \nAs restoration projects often involve \nusing land differently, it is very important \nto involve citizens in the planning \nprocess. The results are, however, \noften seen as providing considerable \nadded value, both because the resulting \nimproved ecosystem services reduce \nmanagement costs and because of \nthe recreational opportunities that are \nachieved\u00a0(Chapter\u00a017).\n\n4.3.3 \nPollution pressures on water \nand\u00a0links to human health \n\u25baSee\u00a0Table 4.4 \n  \nPollution of water with nutrients and \nharmful chemicals is of concern across \n\nTABLE 4.3 Summary assessment \u2014 hydromorphological pressures\n\nPast trends and outlook\n\nPast trends \n(10-15 years)\n\nEurope\u2019s water bodies have been subject to hydromorphological pressures for centuries. Although the \nWater Framework Directive has put in place initatives to reduce these pressures, they continue to affect \n40 % of water bodies. \n\nOutlook to 2030 Continued progress is expected as implementation of the Water Framework Directive continues. Full \nimplementation of policies to restore rivers and put in place alternative flood protection methods, based on \nnatural water retention measures, will be required to deliver improvements. Climate change may increase the \nmagnitude and frequency of floods, leading to a greater demand for flood protection. It will also increase the \ndemand for renewable energy generation, which is contributing to the expansion of hydropower in parts of \nEurope, resulting in increased hydromorphological pressures. \n\nProspects of meeting policy objectives/targets\n\n2020\n\uf053\n\nEurope is not on track to meet the objective of achieving good ecological status for all surface waters by 2020, \nand hydromorphological pressures are expected to continue to affect 40 % of Europe\u2019s surface waters.\n\nRobustness Hydromorphological pressures have been assessed by all EU Member States under the Water Framework \nDirective. While each assessment is based on observations and can be considered robust, differences in \napproaches make comparisons challenging, and a more detailed and comparable analysis at the European \nscale is lacking. The available outlook information is limited, so the assessment of outlook relies primarily on \nexpert judgement and assumes that management implemented under EU policies will be effective and lead to \nsome improvement.\n\f\n102 SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nEurope. The polluting substances stem \nfrom a range of activities linked to \nagricultural, industrial and household \nuse. Emissions to water occur through \nboth point source and diffuse pathways. \nPoint sources refers to emissions that \nhave a specific discharge location, \nwhereas diffuse emissions have many \nsmaller sources spread over a large \narea. Emissions into the atmosphere are \nspread, sometimes over large distances, \neventually to be deposited on land or the \nsea surface (Chapter 8). Such pollutants \ncan be transferred to rivers, lakes, and \ntransitional, coastal and marine water as \nwell as groundwaters. Transformation \nand storage may occur along the \n\nway, altering substances and creating \nmultiyear timelags. Polluted water has \nan impact on human health and aquatic \necosystems. Faecal contamination from \nsewage is both unsafe and unpleasant, \nexcess nutrients lead to eutrophication, \nwhich causes major disturbance of \naquatic ecosystems, and chemicals \nthat are harmful can, when limit values \nare exceeded, be a serious threat to \nboth human and ecosystem health \n(Chapter\u00a010). \n\nTrends in nutrient concentrations\n\nDeclining concentrations of \nbiological oxygen demand (BOD) and \n\northophosphate associated with industrial \nand urban waste water pollution are \nobserved in most of Europe\u2019s surface \nwaters (EEA, 2019c; Figure 4.2 and Table \n4.4). A similar decline is also observed \nfor other industrial emissions (Chapter \n12) and nitrogen surplus has decreased \n(Chapter 13). However, concentrations \nof nitrates are declining much more \nslowly in groundwater and in rivers. \nThese concentrations are more closely \nlinked to agricultural diffuse pollution. \nThe second river basin management \nplans showed that nitrate was the main \npollutant affecting 18\u00a0% of the area of \ngroundwater bodies, although 74\u00a0% of \nEurope\u2019s groundwater body area achieved \n\nRemoval of barriers\n\nBarriers support hydropower \nproduction and water storage, \n\nand they may also help to control \nfloods. They are, however, considered \na hydromorphological pressure under \nthe Water Framework Directive, and \nthey are identified as one of the most \ncommon pressures on rivers in river \nbasin management plans. Barriers disrupt \nthe river ecosystem: they are not easily \npassable, and they alter flow regimes and \nsediment loads. The vast majority are \nsmall barriers, but the cumulative effects \nof many smaller barriers can be very \nlarge.\n\nMany rivers in Europe have plans to \nrestore populations of salmon, eel and \nsturgeon, which depend on migration \nto their headwaters for spawning. \nSeveral hundred thousand barriers are \nfound in Europe\u2019s rivers, preventing \nmigration. In the past, countries have \nimplemented measures to make \nbarriers passable for fish or to remove \nthem altogether (EEA, 2018b, p. 73). In \n\nEstonia, the Cohesion Fund project \n\u2018Restoration of habitats in P\u00e4rnu river \nbasin\u2019, aims to remove seven or eight \ndams on the river and\u00a0its tributaries \nbetween 2015 and 2023, establishing \na 3\u00a0000\u00a0km network of free-flowing \nwater. In particular, removing the Sindi \ndam, located close to the river mouth, \nwill make an important contribution \nto increasing spawning habitats. Many \nbarriers are linked to hydropower \nproduction. In Iceland and Norway, most \nelectricity is supplied by hydropower \n(73\u00a0%\u00a0and\u00a095\u00a0%, respectively). \nHowever, producing this energy has \nreduced the salmon population in the \naffected streams. According to the \nNorwegian\u00a0Environment Agency, 23\u00a0%\u00a0of \nNorway\u2019s\u00a0salmon rivers have been \nnegatively affected by river regulation \nschemes, the vast majority of which are \nfor producing hydropower (NEA, 2018; \nOrkustofnun, 2018). Initiatives are in \nplace to reduce the negative impacts, \nespecially in relation to new projects \n(VRL, 2018). Barriers are also linked \nto reservoirs storing water between \nseasons to support crop production. \n\nRiver restoration projects reconnecting \nrivers and floodplains\n\nBecause of the multiple benefits provided \nby natural floodplains, European policies \nencourage river basin management or \nconservation plans to favour restoration \nbased on natural water retention measures, \nas well as conservation of existing natural \nfloodplains. The need to change approaches \nto flood risk management because of the \nmore uncertain future climate is often an \nunderlying motivation; solutions based on \nnatural properties are more cost-effective \nthan structural measures in the long run (EEA, \n2017a). Natural water retention measures \nrefer to initiatives in which natural flood \nprotection is provided at the same time as \nrestoring the natural properties and functions \nof the floodplain, including its connection to \nthe river. The measures can include structural \nchanges to the river and floodplain and \nchanges that involve managing how land is \nused within the floodplain (EEA, 2018c). Many \nexamples of implemented natural water \nretention measures can be found on the \nEuropean Natural Water Retention Measures \nPlatform (NWRM, 2019). \u25a0\n\nBOX 4.1  Examples of solutions to hydromorphological pressures\n\f\n103SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nFIGURE 4.2 Trends in 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), orthophosphate and nitrates in rivers, and \nconcentrations of nitrates in groundwater\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nmg NO3/l\n\n1992\n1994\n\n1996\n1998\n\n2000\n2002\n\n2004\n2006\n\n2008\n2010\n\n2012\n2014\n\n2016\n2018\n\nNitrate (552 groundwater bodies)\n\n1992\n1994\n\n1996\n1998\n\n2000\n2002\n\n2004\n2006\n\n2008\n2010\n\n2012\n2014\n\n2016\n2018\n\n%\n\nOrthophosphate (756 stations)\n\nAmmonium (783 stations)BOD5 (470 stations)\n\nNitrate (806 stations)\n\nNote: Country coverage: EEA-39 (33 member countries and six cooperating countries).\n\nSource: EEA (2019c).\n\ngood chemical status (EEA, 2018b and \nTable 4.4). \n\nTrends in priority substances\n\nIn recent decades, legislation has helped \nensure reduced emissions of certain \nhazardous substances (EU, 1976, 2000, \n2010; EEA, 2018b). Under the Water \nFramework Directive, chemical status \nis assessed on a list of 33 \u2018priority \nsubstances\u2019 that pose a significant risk \nto or via the aquatic environment, as \nset out in the Environmental Quality \nStandards Directive (EU, 2008b). The \nsubstances or groups of substances on \n\nthe list include selected existing industrial \nchemicals, pesticides, biocides, metals \nand other groups such as polyaromatic \nhydrocarbons (PAHs), which are mainly \nproduced by burning organic matter, \n\nand polybrominated diphenyl ethers \n(PBDEs), which have been used as \nflame retardants. While some priority \nsubstances occur naturally, most arise \nthrough human activities. To prevent \nfurther harm, their emissions must be \nreduced. The use of some of the most \ntoxic substances, such as mercury \nand persistent organic pollutants, \nis heavily restricted, through both \nEuropean legislation and international \nconventions. \n\nIn general, there is better knowledge \nabout priority substances than more \nrecently identified contaminants of \nconcern (Chapters 5, 10, and 12). \n\n38 %\nof the surface water bodies \nin Europe are in good \nchemical status.\n\f\n104 SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nConcentrations in the environment of \nmany \u2018legacy substances\u2019 \u2014 those that \nare no longer manufactured or used \u2014 \nare likely to continue to decline in water \nbecause their use has been phased \nout; however, new substances will \nemerge, and will need to be assessed \nand monitored for their risk to humans \nand the environment.

The results, however, need to \nbe interpreted with some caution. EU \nMember States have chosen different \n\f\n105SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nstrategies for interpreting the results for \nmercury in their assessments. Mercury \nand PBDEs are ubiquitous, meaning that \nthey are found everywhere, but only \nsome countries have included them \nin their assessments. A subset of four \nof the priority substances and groups \nof substances, including mercury, is \ndefined by the Environmental Quality \nStandards Directive as ubiquitous. \nTheir concentrations will decline \nonly very slowly, and their inclusion \nin chemical status under the Water \nFramework Directive may mask the \ntrends in status of other substances. \nIf these ubiquitous substances are \nomitted from the chemical assessment, \nonly 3\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s surface waters \nfail to achieve good chemical status \n(EEA,\u00a02018a,\u00a02018e).\n\nAccording to the information in the \nsecond river basin management plans, \nmany of the priority substances listed \ndo not exceed safety thresholds in \nthe environment, which suggests \nthat\u00a0restrictions and emission controls, \nin particular, have been effective in \npreventing these substances from \nentering the environment. \nThe chemical status of surface \nwaters under the Water\u00a0Framework \nDirective\u00a0is\u00a0assessed against a \nrelatively\u00a0short list of historically \nimportant pollutants \u2014\u00a0the priority \nsubstances. However, this misses \nthe thousands of chemicals in daily \nuse. There is a gap in knowledge at \nthe European level over whether \nany of these other substances \npresent a significant risk to or via \nthe aquatic\u00a0environment, either \nindividually or in combination with \nother substances (EEA, 2018b). This \ndiscussion is further explored in \nChapters 10 and 12, and in\u00a0a\u00a02018 \nEEA\u00a0report (EEA, 2018a). \n\nDrivers of change and solutions\n\nThe declining concentrations of BOD and \nnutrients in surface waters are associated \n\nwith the considerable investments \nmade in improving urban waste \nwater treatment as a consequence \nof the Urban Waste Water Treatment \nDirective. There are still differences \nin the degree of urban waste water \ntreatment among countries, but they \nare getting smaller (EEA, 2017b). The \nproportion of the population connected \nto urban waste water treatment plants \nin northern European countries has \nbeen above 80\u00a0% since 1995, and \nmore than 70\u00a0% of urban waste water \nreceives tertiary treatment. In central \nEuropean countries, connection rates \nhave increased since 1995 and are \nnow at 97\u00a0%, with about 75\u00a0% receiving \ntertiary treatment. The proportion of \nthe population connected to urban \nwaste water treatment in southern, \nsouth-eastern and eastern Europe is \ngenerally lower than in other parts \nof Europe, but it has increased over \nthe last 10 years and levels are now \nat about 70\u00a0% (EEA, 2017b). In spite of \nthe implementation of urban waste \nwater treatment, 15\u00a0% of surface water \nbodies fail to achieve good status due \nto point source pollution (see sheet \n\u2018pressures\u2019 in EEA, 2018e). Europe\u2019s \nbathing waters have also improved. In \n2017, 95\u00a0% of bathing sites had good \nand excellent bathing water quality \n(EEA, 2019b). Water recreation such as \nbeach holidays, swimming, kayaking, \ncanoeing and rafting are of increasing \ninterest to the European public and \nrequire safe bathing water. Areas with \n\nhigh ecological integrity have a higher \npotential for sustainable tourism. \n\nConcentrations of some priority \nsubstances have decreased in surface \nwaters as a result of improved emission \ncontrols (Chapter 12). However, \nalthough countries appear to have \ngood knowledge of emissions, much \nof this knowledge does not extend \nto the European level. The EEA has \nfound that emissions data, especially \non emissions to water, reported under \nthe Water Framework Directive or \nto the European Pollutant Release \nand Transfer Register (E-PRTR) or to \nthe Water Information System for \nEurope (WISE), are incomplete and \ninconsistent, so there is no Europeanwide overview (EEA, 2018a). \n\nDiffuse pollution remains a problem \nin Europe. It is mostly due to excessive \nemissions of nitrogen and phosphorus \nto water and to both historical and \ncurrent emissions of mercury to the \natmosphere and subsequently surface \nwaters. Chemicals used as pesticides \nare also recognised as a source of \ndiffuse pollution, although those used \nas biocides may reach urban waste \nwater treatment plants. In the second \nriver basin management plans, Member \nStates identified that diffuse pollution \nis a significant pressure, affecting 38\u00a0% \nof surface water bodies and 35\u00a0% of the \narea of groundwater bodies (Table 4.4). \nThe use of nitrogen-based fertilisers in \nagriculture is a primary cause of diffuse \npollution (Chapter 13). \n\nIn recent decades, Europe has \nundertaken to reduce the use of \nmineral fertilisers in agriculture. As a \nconsequence, the agricultural nitrogen \nsurplus in the 28 EU Member States \n(EU-28) decreased by 18\u00a0% between \n2000 and 2015 (EEA, 2019a) , but \nfertiliser application rates remain \nhigh, especially in those countries \nwhere agriculture is more intensive. \nIn contrast, the phosphate surplus in \nthe EU-28 increased by 14\u00a0% in the \n\nWhile water quality continues \nto improve, Europe is unlikely \nto achieve good chemical \nstatus for all water bodies \nby\u00a02020.\n\f\n106 SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nshorter period between the reporting \nperiods 2008-2011 and 2012-2015 \n(EC,\u00a02018a). Today, Member States are \nimplementing a number of measures, \nmany of which are compulsory in \nnitrate vulnerable zones designated \nunder the Nitrates Directive, both \nto reduce inputs and to reduce \nthe impacts of a potential surplus. \nThose measures include farm-level \nnutrient management, standards for \nthe timing of fertiliser application, \nappropriate tillage techniques, the \nuse of nitrogen-fixing catch crops, \ncrop rotation and buffer strips\u00a0(3). \nManure, and slurry storage and surplus \nmanagement, as well as reducing \nthe phosphate content of animal \nfeed are also being implemented. In \nspite of these activities, the European \nCommission has concluded that further \n\nefforts to adapt measures to regional \npressures are needed (EC, 2018a). \n\n4.3.4 \nWater abstraction and its pressures \non surface and groundwater \n\u25baSee\u00a0Table\u00a04.5 \n \nEurope\u2019s water abstraction of 243 000 \nmillion cubic metres can be split among \n\nfour main sectors: (1) household water \nuse (14\u00a0%); (2) industry and mining \n(18\u00a0%); (3) cooling water for electricity \nproduction (28\u00a0%); and (4) agriculture \n(40\u00a0%) (Figure 4.3). Geographically there \nare, however, large differences in the \nsectors using more water. In western \nEurope public water supply, cooling \nwater and mining are responsible for the \nmajority of water abstraction, whereas \nin southern Europe and in Turkey \nagriculture uses the largest share. \n\nWater is abstracted from surface and \ngroundwater resources (76\u00a0% vs 24\u00a0%). \nIn total, 89\u00a0% of European groundwater \nbodies achieve good quantitative \nstatus. Overall, water abstraction has \ndecreased by 19\u00a0% (1990-2015), and \non average abstraction corresponds \nto 13\u00a0% of the renewable freshwater \n\n(3) Buffer strips are uncultivated strips along rivers and streams. They are used extensively across Europe as a response to the Nitrates Directive\u2019s \nrequirement to reduce pollution. They reduce the movement of sediment, nutrients and pesticides from farmed fields. Their width varies \ndepending on country and the severity of pollution problems. \n\n95 %\nof bathing sites in the EU met \ngood and excellent bathing \nwater quality standards in 2017.\n\nTABLE 4.4 Summary assessment \u2014 pollution pressures on water and links to human health\n\nPast trends and outlook\n\nPast trends \n(10-15 years)\n\nWater quality has improved, although concentrations of nutrients in many places are still high and affect the \nstatus of waters. Drinking and bathing water quality continues to improve and some hazardous pollutants \nhave been reduced. \n\nOutlook to 2030 Continued progress in improving the chemical status of surface and groundwater is expected as \nimplementation of the Water Framework Directive continues. Improvements in urban waste water treatment \nand industrial pollution will deliver improvements in pollution control, but diffuse pollution is expected to \nremain problematic. It is likely that pressures from newly emerging pollutants and mixtures of chemicals will \nbe identified.\n\nProspects of meeting policy objectives/targets\n\n2020\n\n\uf053\n\nEurope is not on track to meet the objective of achieving good chemical status for all surface and groundwater \nbodies by 2020, with diffuse pollution expected to continue to affect 38 % of surface water bodies and 35 % \nof the groundwater body area. It is acknowledged that this result reflects that countries have taken differing \napproaches to interpreting the results for ubiquitous substances in their chemical status assessments. \n\nRobustness The assessment presented here is based partly on observations reported to the EEA as WISE-SoE data \nflows and partly on information provided as part of the Water Framework Directive reporting. While each \nassessment is based on observations and can be considered robust, differences in approaches make \ncomparisons challenging, and a more detailed and comparable analysis at the European scale is lacking. \nThe available outlook information is limited, so the assessment of outlook relies primarily on expert \njudgement and assumes that management implemented under EU policies will be effective and lead to \nsome improvement. Countries have taken differing approaches tow interpreting the results for ubiquitous \nsubstances in their chemical status assessments. \n\f\n107SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nService industries\n\nHouseholds\n\nMining and quarrying,\nmanufacturing, construction\n\nElectricity\n\nAgriculture\n\nSeasonal (million m3, in 2015)\n\nLakes\n\nArtificial reservoirs\n\nGroundwater\n\nRivers\n\n1\n\n10\n\n24\n\n65\n\n2\n\n12\n\n18\n\n28\n\n40\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\n10 0000\n\n20 000\n\n30 000\n\n40 000\n\n50 000\n\n60 000\n\n70 000\n10 000\n\n5 0000\n\n20 000\n\n15 000\n\n25 000\n\n30 000\n\nSeasonal (million m3,  in 2015)\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nAnnual water use by sectors\n(%, in 2015)\n\nAnnual freshwater abstraction by source\n(%, in 2015)\n\nWater exploitation by river basin\n\n0 % > 40 % Data not available\n\nWinter, 2015 Summer, 2015\n\nFIGURE 4.3 Water use in Europe by economic sector and by source\n\nIn Europe, around \n243\u00a0000\u00a0million cubic \nmetres of water per year \nare abstracted for different \nsectors.

These numbers, \nhowever, mask large geographical \nvariations. Increasingly, in countries with \nlimited freshwater resources, such as \nCyprus, Malta, and Spain, freshwater is \nsupplied by desalinating seawater. The \nmilestone set in the EU Roadmap to a \nresource efficient Europe, namely that \nwater abstraction should stay below 20\u00a0% \nof available renewable water resources \nin Europe, was not achieved in 36 river \nbasins, corresponding to 19\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s \nterritory, in summer 2015. Consequently, \naround 30\u00a0% of the European population \nwas exposed to water scarcity in \nsummer 2015 compared with 20\u00a0% in \n2014 (EEA,\u00a02018c). In addition, most \nof the 11\u00a0% of groundwater bodies \nthat do not achieve good quantitative \nstatus are found in Cyprus, Malta, and \nSpain, although in the United Kingdom \ngood groundwater quantitative status \nis not reached for more than 50\u00a0% of \ngroundwater bodies for the Thames and \nAnglian districts (EEA, 2018d, groundwater \nquantitative status). In these areas more \nthan 20\u00a0% of the renewable resource may \nbe used. \n\nWater storage and abstraction \nplaces considerable pressure on the \nenvironment. While the water used \n\nis less than the amount abstracted \nbecause some water is returned to the \nenvironment, water scarcity still occurs in \nparts of Europe, both in the summer and \nin the winter (Figure 4.3). The underlying \ncauses of water scarcity, expressed by the \nwater exploitation index, differ: in western \nEurope it is primarily linked to cooling \nwater needed for energy production \nand industry; in southern Europe water \nscarcity is linked to agriculture. \n\nClimate change projections suggest \nthat Europe will face changes in the \ntemperature of water and in precipitation \nin the future (Chapter 7). Dry parts of \nEurope will become drier, wet parts will \nbecome wetter, and the seasonality and \nintensity of precipitation may change. \nFlood frequencies could change in \nresponse to altered precipitation patterns. \n\nEurope is thought to have adequate \nwater resources, but water scarcity and \ndrought is no longer uncommon. In \nEurope, water scarcity can arise both as \na consequence of the water demand for \nhuman activities and as a consequence \nof reduced meteorological inputs. \nWater scarcity is becoming increasingly \nfrequent and widespread in Europe, and \nit is expected to get worse as changing \nseasonality precipitation decreases and \ntemperatures increase in response to \na changing climate. This will also make \nthe environmental pressures of water \nabstraction worse, and the demand \nto better understand and manage the \nclimate-water-ecosystem-agriculture \nnexus is likely to increase in the future. \n\n4.4 \nResponses and prospects of \nmeeting agreed targets and \nobjectives\n\nEnough water of good quality is a \nfundamental objective of Europe\u2019s \nenvironmental policy as well as \nfor achieving the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.

However, water stress remains a concern in \nsome regions and the future availability of water will be affected by climate change. \n\nProspects of meeting policy objectives/targets\n\n2020\n\uf053\n\nEurope is not on track to meet the objective of achieving good quantitative status of all groundwater bodies by \n2020. Water abstraction currently exceeds 20 % of the renewable freshwater resource in 19 % of Europe\u2019s area.\n\nRobustness Good quantitative status is based on EU Member State assessments. While each assessment is based on \nobservations and can be considered robust, differences in approaches make comparisons challenging. Water \nabstraction is recorded by Member States, whereas water use is attributed to sectors using a model. Outlook \ninformation is limited, so the assessment of outlook relies primarily on expert judgement and assumes that \nmanagement implemented under EU policies will be effective and lead to some improvement. \n\f\n110 SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nsetting legally binding objectives for \nEurope\u2019s water and for managing and \nreducing environmental pressures from \nhydromorphology, pollution and water \nabstraction. This policy framework will \nalso support the delivery of Europe\u2019s \ncontribution to SDG\u00a06 on water. \n\nIn 2015, the second cycle of developing \nriver basin management plans was \nfinalised. Subsequently, the results were \nreported to the EU, and a comprehensive \nanalysis of these results is presented in a \n2018 EEA report (EEA, 2018b). A parallel \nprocess for the reporting of the first \nflood risk management plans under the \nFloods Directive has also taken place \n(EC,\u00a02019). The European Commission \nis also developing a proposal for the \nDrinking Water Directive, to secure better \nprotection of human health and to meet \nSDG\u00a06, and an evaluation of the Urban \nWaste Water Treatment Directive, to \nalign it with other policies to realise the \npotential for energy savings.\n\nThe Water Framework Directive and \nthe Floods Directive operate on the \nscale of river basins. Water within a \nriver basin is connected, and hence \nany decision that influences water \nquantity or quality in one part of the \ndistrict can influence water in another \npart. Managing water quality and \nquantity requires detailed knowledge of \nwater abstraction, land use and other \npressures on the river basin scale. This \nknowledge is being developed as part \nof the implementation of river basin \nmanagement plans under the Water \nFramework Directive and flood risk \nmanagement plans under the Floods \nDirective. It is on this scale that effective \nsolutions for water management can \nbe found for Europe\u2019s 110\u00a0000 water \nbodies distributed across 180 river \nbasins. River basin management \nplans already encompass transitional \nand coastal waters; they provide an \neffective means of regulating landbased pollution of the sea, especially \nwith regard to nutrient and hazardous \nsubstance pollution.\n\nAlready, the process of developing \nriver basin management plans has \nprovided a better understanding of \nthe status, the pressures causing \nfailure to achieve good status, and the \nmeasures implemented to generate \nimprovement. Member States have \nimplemented measures that improve \nwater quality and reduce pressures \non hydromorphology. This knowledge \nis essential for achieving future \nimprovements. \n\nThe analysis of the river basin \nmanagement plans shows that Europe is \non the way to achieving good status for \nwater, but it also shows that the target \nof achieving good status for water in \n2015 was not achieved. An initial analysis \nof flood risk management plans also \nshows that flood risk in Europe is being \nreduced and that many countries have \nplans for implementing natural water \nretention measures that will support \nhydromorphological improvements.\n\nIn recent decades, legislation has helped \nto ensure reduced emissions of certain \nhazardous substances (Section 4.4.3). \nHowever, there is a very large number of \nchemicals in use (Chapter 10) and only \na few are listed as priority substances \nunder the Water Framework Directive. \nThe watch list, established under the \nPriority Substances Directive (EU, 2013b), \nprovides a mechanism for gathering \ninformation on harmful substances for \nwhich information on concentrations in \nthe aquatic environment is lacking.\n\nOne of the major successes for water \nquality has been the reduction of nutrient, \ncertain hazardous substance and \nmicrobial pollution in rivers, lakes, and \ntransitional and coastal waters following \nthe implementation of urban waste \nwater treatment, industrial emission \ncontrols and restrictions of chemicals. \nAlthough the Urban Waste Water \nTreatment Directive in particular is still \nnot fully implemented in all countries, its \neffectiveness is clear. Where urban waste \nwater treatment has been implemented, \nconcentrations of nutrients, hazardous \nsubstances and microbial pollution in \nwater have been reduced. This also \nsupports achieving improved drinking \nwater and bathing water quality, which \nin return support a high level of human \nhealth across Europe. Options for \nincreased reuse of urban waste water \nare being considered by the European \nCommission (EC, 2018b). The EU supports \nthe development of drinking water, \nurban waste water treatment and flood \nprotection infrastructure through the \nEuropean Regional Development Fund \nand the Cohesion Fund. \n\nIn contrast, it has proven much more \ncomplex to reduce diffuse pollution. The \nNitrates Directive supports reducing \ndiffuse nutrient pollution, which is one \nof the most commonly cited pressures \non Europe\u2019s surface and groundwater \nbodies. In areas designated as nitrate \nvulnerable zones, the Nitrates Directive \nrequires management of fertiliser use, \nand of manure and slurry storage and \nuse, with the aim of reducing emissions. \nEfforts have, however, not yet been \nenough to sufficiently reduce diffuse \npollution. Reducing diffuse pollution is \na major societal challenge. It involves \nreducing atmospheric pollution and \npollution from multiple small sources, \nand it applies to both nutrients and \nhazardous substances. Altering \nagricultural diffuse pollution requires \nsteps to be taken at farm level to reduce \npollution, which requires both farm-level \ninvestments and sometimes accepting \nreduced crop yields (Chapter 16). The new \n\nFreshwaters remain \nsignificantly affected by diffuse \npollution, hydromorphological \nchanges and water \nabstraction.\n\f\n111SOER 2020/Freshwater\n\nPART 2\n\nCAP reform, which is currently being \nnegotiated between the European \nCommission, Council and Parliament, \ncontains several elements that could \nsupport achieving better progress to \nthis end. For example, the proposed \nCAP reform requires EU Member \nStates to increase their ambition to \nachieve the objectives of the Water \nFramework and Nitrates Directives \ncompared with the 2014-2020 \nprogramming period, including by \nstimulating national coordination \nwith environmental authorities. \nHowever, the final details of the new \nCAP could still change considerably \n(Chapter 13).\n\nThe EU Blueprint to safeguard \nEurope\u2019s water resources (EC, 2012) \npoints to the insufficient use of \neconomic instruments as one of \nseveral reasons for management \nproblems not being adequately \naddressed. The fitness check of \nthe Water Framework and Floods \nDirectives, currently undertaken \nby the European Commission, \nincludes the objective of enabling a \ndiscussion with all stakeholders. Input \nwill encompass how the directives \nhave brought about changes in \nthe management of water and \nimprovements in the state of water \nbodies and in the strategies to reduce \nthe risk of flooding across the EU. \nThe fitness check tackles both the \nfunctioning and the interactions of \nthe directives, as well as the costs and \nbenefits that the various stakeholders \nattach to them. \n\nChemical pollution remains an issue. \nAlthough legacy contaminants are \ndeclining, little is known about new \nsubstances. The large number of \npotentially hazardous chemicals \nmakes monitoring programmes \nacross Europe highly variable, \nand hence it is difficult to make a \nconsistent assessment of chemical \npollution on the European scale \n(Chapter\u00a010). \n\nFurthermore, the freshwater policy \nframework emphasises the integrated \nrole of freshwater in achieving both \nbiodiversity and marine environmental \npolicy goals. Improving the status of \nwater will also support achieving good \nconservation status of species and \nhabitats under the Habitats and Birds \nDirectives (EEC, 1979, 1992) and the good \nenvironmental status of marine waters \nunder the Marine Strategy Framework \nDirective (EU, 2008a), especially for \ndescriptors of eutrophication and \nhazardous substances. Many of the \nhabitats and species protected under the \nHabitats and Birds Directives depend on \nthe adequate availability of water and on \ngood ecological and chemical status of \nsurface waters. For example, 39 floodplain \nhabitats and 14 bog, mire and fen habitats \nare listed in Annex I of the Habitats \nDirective. In many cases, the availability \nof surface- or groundwater is critical to \nachieving good conservation status. Thus, \na clear link exists between the objectives \nof those directives. Similarly nutrient \nand chemical pollution in the marine \nenvironment often stems from landbased activities that need to be managed \nthrough river basin management plans \nunder the Water Framework Directive. \nThe Marine Strategy Framework Directive \ncommon implementation strategy \nhas been very explicit on the need to \ndevelop this link to avoid having separate \nprocesses for the two directives, and this \nwas further supported by Commission \nDecision (EU) 2017/848 on methodological \nstandards (EU, 2017). However, while \nthe requirements to link the directives \nare in place, and some coordination is \nlikely to occur within Member States, the \nexplicit outcome of this activity is not \nfully known at the European level. There \nare few mechanisms in place to insist on \ndeveloping cross-policy strategies.\n\nAs it is anticipated that climate change \nimpacts will increase towards 2030, water \nwill also be affected, placing an additional \ndemand on effective water management \ntools. Pricing and metering of household \nwater are important instruments \n\nsupporting the Water Framework \nDirective, and they need to be adapted to \nagricultural water abstraction to ensure \nefficiency gains such as those that can be \nobtained through optimising irrigation. \nIt is also important to have a strategy in \nplace for keeping saved water for the \nenvironment, rather than for increasing \nagricultural production. In parts of Europe, \nleakages from the public water supply \nsystem can be as much as 30\u00a0%, and \nreducing these is an obvious efficiency \ngain. As European policymakers strive to \ndevelop a sustainable strategy for water \nmanagement, the development of new \nreservoirs or transfer of water between \nbasins is only in line with the Water \nFramework Directive if their ecological \nstatus has not deteriorated (EU, 2000, \nArticle 4.7). Instead, drought management \nstrategies need to be developed, as \npart of river basin management and in \nresponse to climate\u00a0change. \n\nProjected climate change is likely to \nsignificantly affect water temperatures \nand quantities. Southern Europe is likely \nto struggle more with water scarcity \nand drought issues in the coming years, \nwhereas precipitation is projected to \nincrease in northern Europe. Thus, \nprotecting people and their economic \nand cultural assets from flooding will \ncontinue to be of major importance. \nImproved flood risk management, as \nrequired by the Floods Directive, in \ncombination with green infrastructure \nand nature-based solutions (Chapter 17), \nwhich both reduce flood risk and improve \necosystems, is a tool for achieving \nbenefits and policy objectives for both \npeople and nature. However, it remains \nunclear whether adaptation is happening \nfast enough to ensure sufficient capacity \nto cope with future climatic changes. \nAs water has a profound influence on \necosystems, it will become increasingly \ncritical to address and monitor the \nclimate-water-ecosystem-agriculture \nnexus (Chapter 16), including in the \nlight of other uses. It would be a missed \nopportunity for Europe not to consider \nthe full extent of these links.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Reducing such impacts while retaining the usefulness of \nplastics requires a shift towards a more circular and sustainable plastics system. This \nreport tells the story of plastics, and their effect on the environment and climate, and \nlooks at their place in a European circular economy.\n\nPlastics comprise a range of materials, \neach with its own unique characteristics, \nproperties and applications \u2014 99\u00a0% of \nplastics are made from carbon from \nfossil fuels (CIEL, 2019). The consumption \nand production of plastics have grown \nexponentially since the 1950s, with the \nresulting products (including packaging, \nkitchenware, electronics, textiles, car \ncomponents and furniture) constituting \nan important part of everyday life. Plastics \nare light, cheap, durable and can be made \nin an infinite number of variations, and \nthe plastics industry contributes to growth \nand job creation.\n\nPlastic packaging is the largest sector \nof the plastics industry, representing \nalmost 40\u00a0% of total plastic consumption. \nAmong other things, plastics provide new \ntransport solutions for the logistics sector, \nand they are important for improving \nhygiene in healthcare (e.g. in virus \nprotection) and for reducing food waste \nby keeping food fresh for longer. Plastics \nare also used in cars and aeroplanes, \nreducing weight and improving fuel \nefficiency, in synthetic fibres in clothing \nand other textiles, and in furniture \nand\u00a0kitchenware.\n\nIn recent years, plastic has been subject \nto increased focus and attention from \nan environmental perspective. Being \nlightweight and durable are two key \nstrengths of plastic, but this also means \nthat plastic spreads easily and can persist \nin the environment for many years. \nPlastic waste can now be found in our \nparks, on our beaches, at the bottom of \nthe oceans and seas, on top of mountains \nand even inside our bodies. The leakage \nof plastics into the environment poses a \nsignificant problem for current and future \ngenerations, and there are significant \ngaps in our knowledge about the kind \nof effects that this exposure can have. \nThe potential magnitude of impacts on \nthe environment and human health \nvaries a lot depending on the type of \nplastics and the chemical additives they \ncontain. The negative effects of plastics \ngo beyond littering and leakage: 7\u00a0% of \ncrude oil output is used to make plastics, \na proportion set to grow rapidly as \nconsumption of plastics is expected to \ndouble in the coming 20 years (EC, 2020). \nThe energy and fossil feedstock used \nto produce and transport plastics and \nmanage plastic waste creates a large and \ngrowing carbon footprint.\n\f\nToday, plastics are too often used as single \nuse products, then discarded, then too \noften littered. The current linear models of \nproduction and consumption of plastics are \nfailing nature and our economy at the same \ntime, which is why we need a circular plastics \neconomy. Reducing the environmental and \nclimate impacts of plastics, while retaining \nthe usefulness of plastics in society, requires \nmaking the systems of plastic consumption and \nproduction more circular, resource efficient and \nsustainable, thereby enabling longer use, reuse \nand recycling. Adequate policies and the scaling \nof circular business models can, together \nwith changes in the behaviour of producers \nand consumers, enable a more circular and \nsustainable plastics system.\n\nThis report introduces the wide family \nof plastics and briefly explores the main \nchallenges involved in transitioning towards \na circular plastics economy. It shows that, \nalthough the production, use and trade \nof plastics continue to grow, significant \ndifferences exist between Europe and \nother regions of the world. Furthermore, \nit explains the environmental and climate \nimpacts that occur across the life cycle of \nplastics, including the leakage of plastics \ninto natural environments and the growing \ndemand for oil and emissions of greenhouse \ngases. Finally, it shows that an increasing \nnumber of EU initiatives are already in \nplace to address some of these issues, \nbut that more coordination and scaling up \nis needed. Three pathways (smarter use; \nincreased circularity; and use of renewable \nraw materials and decarbonisation) are \ndiscussed, which together can help ensure \nthe continued longer term move towards a \nsustainable and circular plastics system.\n\n\u00a9 iStock.com/eamanver 7\n\f\n\u00a9 Pixabay8\n\f\n9\n\nAbout plastics and the \ncircular\u00a0economy\nPlastics are a large family of different materials, each with its own unique characteristics, \nproperties and applications. To address the environmental and climate challenges \nassociated with the production, use and disposal of these various types of plastics, a \ncircular economy offers a promising strategy for a more sustainable plastics system in \nwhich materials and products never become waste.\n\nPlastics: one name, many types\n\nPlastics are composed of polymers (large \nmolecules comprising many repeated \nsubunits called monomers) combined with \nchemical additives. A common feature of \nplastics is that, depending on which chemical \nadditives are used, they can be easily \nturned into many different forms during \nproduction. Chemical additives may, for \ninstance, improve the flexibility of plastics or \nreduce their flammability.\n\nDespite their distinct composition, all plastics \nare based on carbon. Whereas fossil-based \nplastics use carbon derived from oil and \nnatural gas (petrochemicals), bio-based \nplastics use carbon derived from renewable \nmaterials, such as agricultural products, \ncellulose and even carbon dioxide (CO2). \nPlastics, whether derived from oil or sugar, \nfor example, can have identical properties.\n\nPlastics can also be divided into different \ntypes according to what they are made \nof (Figure 1), whether they are natural or \nsynthetic, whether they can be remoulded or \nnot, and how they can be recycled without \ncausing contamination.\n\nA more circular \nplastics\u00a0economy\n\nA more circular plastics economy seeks to \nminimise the need for virgin material and \nenergy in the production of plastics while \nensuring that environmental pressures \nlinked to resource extraction, production, \nconsumption and waste are reduced. By \nimproving design, adopting higher quality \nplastics, and encouraging and enabling \nreuse, repair, remanufacturing and \nrecycling, a circular plastics economy aims \nto retain the value and utility of products \nwithin the economy for as long as possible \nto ensure that plastics never become waste \n(EEA, 2016; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, \n2016). This is as opposed to the current \nlinear system of plastic production and \nuse (dominated by low-value, low-cost and \nshort-life plastics) in which all phases of \nthe value chain consume finite resources \nand cause environmental impacts. Figure 2 \nshows the current challenges in achieving \na shift from a linear plastics economy to a \ncircular plastics economy.\n\f\n10\n\nTypes of plastics Symbol Applications\n\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) Beverage bottles, medicine jars, rope, \nclothing and carpet fibre\n\nHigh-density polyethylene (HDPE)\nContainers for milk, motor oil, \nshampoos and conditioners, soap bottles,\ndetergents and bleaches\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) All kinds of pipes and tiles\n\nLow-density polyethylene (LDPE) Cling-film, sandwich bags, squeezable\nbottles and plastic grocery bags\n\nPolypropylene (PP)\nLunch boxes, margarine containers, \nyogurt pots, syrup bottles, prescription\nbottles, plastic bottle caps and plastic cups\n\nPolystyrene (PS) Disposable coffee cups, plastic food boxes, \nplastic cutlery and packing foam\n\nPolyethylene (PE)\nAcrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)\nPolyamide (PA) or nylons\nPolybutylene terephthalate (PBT)\n\nBaby bottles, compact discs and medical\nstorage containers\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 1.

During early \nefforts to stop the spread of the virus, the \nWorld Health Organization estimated that \n89 million medical masks per month were \nrequired globally, together with 76 million \nexamination gloves and 1.6 million sets of \ngoggles (WHO, 2020).\n\nAs a result of lockdown measures across \nmost of Europe, coupled with stringent \nhygiene requirements, COVID-19 has had \na significant effect on the consumption of \nsingle-use plastic packaging and products \nsuch as plastic cutlery. As most restaurants \nin Europe were closed for on-site dining, \nmany shifted to offering takeaway and \ndelivery services using single-use plastic \ncontainers. Several large coffee retailers \nstopped allowing customers to bring \nrefillable containers, using disposable cups \nin their place. Meanwhile, online shopping \noutlets have seen a surge in demand, with \nmany products packed in single-use plastic.\n\n\u00a9 Juan Miguel, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA12\n\f\n13\n\nAlthough disposable plastic products have \nplayed an important role in preventing the \nspread of COVID-19, the upsurge in demand \nfor these items may challenge EU efforts in \nthe shorter term to curb plastic pollution \nand move towards a more sustainable and \ncircular plastics system. The production, \nconsumption and disposal of additional \nsingle-use plastics will have led to greater \nimpacts on the environment and climate \nthan otherwise, such as increased air \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions, \nwaste generation and the risk of littering. \nIn cases where the cleanliness of multiple \nuse products cannot be guaranteed, single \nuse products may be preferred, but without \nundermining or delaying the objectives and \nrules of the Single Use Plastics Directive.\n\nIn addition to the direct effects stemming \nfrom increased demand for single-use \nplastics, other factors related to the pandemic \nare important to note. Reduced economic \nactivity has seen sharp falls in global oil \nprices. In turn, this has made it significantly \ncheaper for manufacturers to produce plastic \ngoods from virgin, fossil-based materials \nthan to use recycled plastic materials. The \neconomic viability of the European and global \nplastics recycling market is presently under \nsignificant pressure. Lower market demand \nfor recycled plastics has also complicated the \nefforts of many of Europe\u2019s municipalities to \nmanage their waste practices sustainably, \nand less desirable waste disposal options \nare being used for significant quantities of \nplastic\u00a0waste.\n\f\n\u00a9 iStock.com/curtoicurto14\n\f\n15\n\nThe consumption, production \nand trade of plastics\nWith an exponential increase in the production and consumption of these versatile and \ncheap materials ever since the 1950s, plastics have become an integral part of modern \nsociety. However, significant differences in the demand for, production of and trade in \nplastics exist between Europe and other regions of the world.\n\nPlastic consumption and use\n\nGlobal plastic use has increased very \nrapidly, from almost zero around 1950 \nto 359\u00a0million tonnes worldwide in 2018. \nPlastic use in Europe alone was 61.8\u00a0million \ntonnes in 2018, but it seems to have \nstabilised somewhat, while its use in other \nparts of the world is still increasing rapidly \n(PlasticsEurope, 2019).\n\nThe global average use of plastics is 45\u00a0kg \nper person per year. Western Europe \n(Europe excluding central Europe and the \nCommonwealth of Independent States) uses \nthree times as much \u2014 around 136\u00a0kg per \nperson (Plastics Insight, 2016).\n\nThe three largest end-use plastic markets \nare (1) packaging, (2) building and \nconstruction, and (3) the automotive \nindustry, accounting for almost 70\u00a0% of all \nplastics used in Europe. The single largest \nend-use market for plastics is packaging, \nwhich constitutes almost 40\u00a0% of European \ndemand. Although synthetic textile fibres \nare also made from plastics, they are not \nincluded in the official statistics for plastics. \n\f\n16\n\nBox 1. Plastics for textiles\n\nA significant proportion of plastics goes into synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, used \nfor textiles. Plastic fibres are used for clothing, as well as furniture upholstery, carpets and other \napplications. Although this is one of the largest end-use markets, textile fibres are usually not \nincluded in the statistics for plastics. Synthetic fibres constitute the largest share of all textile fibres \nused today. Almost two thirds of all textile fibres are synthetic, and one third are plant based (mainly \ncotton), regenerated fibres (mainly viscose) or animal fibres (mainly wool).\n\nWhereas the production of natural fibres has grown slowly over the past 30 years, the use of \nsynthetic fibres has grown rapidly. Over the past 25 years, synthetic fibres have become the \nmost common type of fibre for textiles, and production amounts to around 65\u00a0million tonnes per \nyear. Synthetic fibres are dominated by polyester, which is almost always the same as the plastic \nwhich is known as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) when used for water bottles or packaging. \nHowever, other plastics are also used for textiles \u2014 see Figure 3. More details on textiles and their \nenvironmental impact can be found in a recent EEA briefing and underpinning report (EEA, 2019c; \nETC/WMGE, 2019).\n\nFigure 3.

(2019).\n\f\n17\n\nBox 2. Plastics for building and construction\n\nThe second largest application of plastics (after packaging) is also one of the most invisible. The \nbuilding and construction industry is responsible for 20\u00a0% of plastic use in Europe. Plastic pipes are \nused to supply water and remove sewage, as well as for cables and other technical installations. \nPlastic membranes are used as moisture-proof layers in walls and ceilings. Plastic window frames \nand profiles have become popular, as they are energy efficient and do not require paint; plastic \ninsulation is used extensively. Plastic flooring is common, especially in public buildings (Agarwal and \nGupta, 2017).\n\nThe building and construction sector has special requirements (including for durability and strength) \nfor the plastics it uses. The most commonly used plastic is polyvinyl chloride (PVC), accounting \nfor 43\u00a0% of plastic used in the sector. In fact, 69\u00a0% of all PVC produced is used in building and \nconstruction (H\u00e4kkinen et al., 2019).\n\nWhereas plastics for packaging are designed and produced for a lifetime of weeks or months, \nplastics intended for building and construction are designed for a lifetime of decades. This \nintroduces significant challenges when it comes to recycling. Since the plastics from buildings that \nwe want to recycle today are often 30-50 years old, they contain substances that are no longer \npermitted. This means that new plastic products must be designed today to be recyclable in  \n30-50 years\u2019 time.\n\nPlastic water and sewage pipes used in building and construction \u00a9 Pixabay\n\f\n\u00a9 Pexels18\n\f\n19\n\nProduction of plastics\n\nWith its numerous uses and growing supply \nand demand since the 1950s, the plastic sector \nhas become a very large industry. It employs \nover 1.6 million people in Europe \u2014 including \nin raw material producers, plastic converters, \nrecyclers and machinery manufacturers \u2014 and \nhad an annual turnover in 2018 of EUR\u00a0360 \nbillion (PlasticsEurope, 2019).\n\nGlobal production of plastics has been \ngrowing at an average rate of 4.6\u00a0% per \nyear over the past decade (PlasticsEurope, \n2019). The geographical distribution of \n\nplastics production around the world has \nchanged considerably in that time, as \nshown in Figure 4. Although production in \nthe 28 EU Member States as of 1\u00a0July 2013 \n(EU-28), and in Norway and Switzerland, \nhas only increased by about 1.2\u00a0% per year, \nproduction elsewhere has grown, leading to \na falling market share for European plastics \nproduction from about 24\u00a0% to 17\u00a0%. The \ngrowth has primarily been in China, which \nhas doubled its share of the global market \nfrom 15\u00a0% to 30\u00a0%. North America has also \nlost some of its market share, but less so than \nEurope because of recent US investments in \nproduction based on shale gas.\n\nNote:       Europe, EU28, Norway and Switzerland; CIS, Commonwealth of Independent States;  \n NAFTA, North American Free Trade Agreement.\nSource:   Based on data from Plastics Europe (2010-2019).\n\nFigure 4.

The value chain for plastics\n\nSource:  Adapted from Nielsen and Bauer (2019).\n\f\nPlastics and chemical production has seen \nfaster growth than other markets for oil in \nrecent years, some of which are expected \nto decline as electric transport gains share \nfrom fossil fuel-based propulsion. This has \nresulted in increased interest in plastics from \noil companies, which are investing in plastics \nand chemicals firms, and production capacity.\n\nThe value chain for plastic is long and \ncomplicated. As shown in Figure 5, crude oil \nfractions, such as naphtha and natural gas \nliquids, are cracked to produce monomers \n\u2014 the building block molecules for polymers. \nDuring the polymerisation stage, the \nmonomers are linked together to form larger \nmolecules called polymers. The polymers are \nthen mixed with various chemical additives \nthat give the plastic its desired properties. This \nis done during a process called compounding. \nAfter compounding, the plastic material is \nused by a converter to produce the final \nplastic products, such as bottles, water \npipes and interior panels for cars. Although \napproximately one third of these products \nis collected for recycling in Europe once they \nbecome waste, the majority is leaked into the \nenvironment, incinerated or landfilled. Only \na small fraction is circulated for reuse, repair \nand remanufacturing (PlasticsEurope, 2019).\n\nThe production of primary plastics is \ndominated by large multinationals in the \npetrochemical industry. Many of them are \nsubsidiaries to or partially owned by large \noil firms, some of which are controlled by \nnational governments. Production usually \ntakes place in large industrial clusters \n\n21\n\nin which oil refineries, steam crackers, \npolymerisation units and other chemical \nproduction facilities are co-located. Some \nof the world\u2019s largest chemical clusters are \nfound in various parts of Europe, such as the \nareas around Rotterdam (the Netherlands), \nD\u00fcsseldorf (Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), \nLyon (France) and Cheshire (United \nKingdom) (Ketels, 2007).\n\nIn contrast, the downstream plastics \nindustry, namely plastic compounders \n(adding chemical additives) and converters \n(converting into specific products), are \nmostly smaller firms distributed throughout \nEurope and other regions of the world.\n\nThe plastics trade\n\nPlastics are traded globally, and Europe \nimports and exports large amounts of both \nprimary and non-primary plastics every year. \nPrimary plastics are the plastic materials \nthemselves, such as pure polymer granulates \nand compounded plastics. Non-primary \nplastics are plastic components for later \nassembly, such as car interior panels, and \nfinished products, for example tubes and \nbags, as well as products containing plastics, \nsuch as electronics, furniture and\u00a0cars.\n\nThe EU has a trade surplus in both primary \nand non-primary plastics, meaning that the \nvalue of the exports for both categories \nis larger than the value of the imports, as \nshown in Figure 6. Europe had a positive \ntrade balance of EUR\u00a015 billion in 2018 \n(PlasticsEurope, 2019).\n\f\n22\n\nSource:  Based on data from UN Comtrade (2019a).\n\nExports: primary plastics\n\nImports: primary plastics\n\nExports: non-primary plastics\n\nImports: non-primary plastics\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nTrade value (USD billion)\n\nFigure 6.

Most of this waste was previously \nexported to China and Hong Kong, as can be \nseen in Figure 7.\n\nBox 3. Polyethylene and its trade\n\nPolyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used \nplastic worldwide, especially for packaging \nin the form of bottles or film, as well as for \npipes and cable insulation. About 100\u00a0million \ntonnes of PE are produced every year.\n\nA significant amount of PE is traded \nworldwide. Saudi Arabia and the United \nStates are significantly larger exporters than \nmost others, and the EU countries Belgium, \nGermany and the Netherlands are also \nlarge exporters. China is by far the largest \nimporter, as the massive manufacturing \nindustry in China demands considerable \nvolumes of plastics. Of the EU countries, \nGermany, Belgium, Italy and France are those \nwith the largest imports.\n\n\u00a9 Orhan Kartal, Sustainably Yours /EEA24\n\f\n25\n\nThe quantities and patterns of exported \nplastic waste have shifted, following an \ninitial temporary Chinese restriction in 2013 \nand then new regulations in China banning \nthe import of non-industrial plastic waste \n\nFigure 7.

However, litter is \njust one of the negative environmental impacts that occur throughout the life cycle of \nplastics, as can be seen in Figure 9. All of these must be addressed to create a circular and \nsustainable plastics economy. This chapter focuses on impacts occurring throughout the \nresource extraction, production, consumption and end-of-life phases of plastics. The most \nsignificant impacts from each phase are discussed below, recognising that many impacts \noccur in all phases, but to a varying degree.\n\nImpacts of extracting oil and gas \nresources for plastics\n\n\u2022 If the production and use of plastics \ncontinue to increase as projected, the \nplastic industry will account for 20\u00a0% of \nglobal oil use by 2050, an increase from \ntoday\u2019s 7\u00a0%.\n\n\u2022 During the extraction of oil and gas for \nplastic production, greenhouse gases \nand multiple pollutants are emitted to \nthe air, and large volumes of waste water \ncontaining dispersed oil, hazardous \nsubstances and other harmful chemicals \nare leaked into the environment.\n\nExtraction of oil and gas\n\nThe system of consumption and production \nof plastics implies significant resource use, \nmainly of fossil fuels, which has implications \nfor the environment and climate. Over \n99\u00a0% of plastics (CIEL, 2019) are produced \nfrom fossil fuel resources, mainly oil and \n\ngas. Approximately half of the oil used for \nplastic is feedstock locked into the plastic \nproducts, whereas half is used as fuel \nin the plastic production process (Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation, 2016).\n\nIf the use of plastics continues to grow as \nexpected, it is projected that the plastics \nindustry will account for 20\u00a0% of global \noil use by 2050, an increase from today\u2019s \n7\u00a0%. The growth rate of plastic production \n(3.5-3.8\u00a0% per year) is much faster than \nthe growth in demand for oil (0.5\u00a0% \nannually) (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, \n2016). Although the vast majority of oil \nis currently used for fuels, this share \nis expected to decrease in the coming \nyears as cars and trucks are increasingly \nelectrified, leading to reduced demand for \npetrol and diesel in developed economies. \nThe International Energy Agency projects \nthat plastics and other petrochemicals \nwill be the largest driver of the growth in \nthe demand for oil up to 2030 (OECD and \nIEA,\u00a02018).\n\f\n30\n\n!\n\nBuilding and\nconstruction\n\nPackaging\n\nVehicles\n\nElectrical and\nelectronic equipment\n\nTextiles\n\n\u2022   Use of oil and gas\n\n\u2022   Greenhouse gas\n     emissions and air\n     pollutants\n\n\u2022    Oil spills\n\n\u2022   Use of oil and gas\n\n\u2022   Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants\n\n\u2022   Litter on land and in oceans, seas and freshwater\n\n\u2022   Greenhouse gas emissions from incineration \n     and landfill\n\n\u2022   Human exposure to \n     toxic substances\n\nTh\ne \n\nlif\ne \n\ncy\ncl\n\ne \nof\n\n p\nla\n\nst\nic\n\ns\nEn\n\nvi\nro\n\nnm\nen\n\nta\nl i\n\nm\npa\n\nct\ns\n\nPRODUCTIONEXTRACTION USE AFTER USE\n\nFigure 9.

US shale gas extraction affects European plastics production and use \n\nShale gas extraction in the United States, which uses hydraulic fracturing (\u2018fracking\u2019; see Figure 10), \ngrew very quickly during the beginning of the 21st century. Shale gas production constituted only \n1\u00a0% of US domestic natural gas production in 2000; however, in just 10 years the share increased \nto 20\u00a0% (Stevens, 2012). The rapid growth in production led to an oversupply of gas on the North \nAmerican market. At the same time, technologies were developed for managing liquefied natural \ngas to enable a global trade in gas, as there has been in oil for decades.\n\nBy making use of technologies similar to those developed for liquefied natural gas, a global market \nfor ethane has been established. Several European firms have signed contracts for US ethane, which \nis being shipped across the Atlantic in large specialised ships. European production of plastics is \nthus now relying on shale gas products from the United States.\n\nShale gas extraction and hydraulic fracturing continue to be contentious issues, as they use large \nvolumes of water and chemicals, while issues regarding leakage of potent greenhouse gases and \nchemicals remain\u00a0unanswered.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions and climate \nchange arising from oil and gas extraction\n\nPlastics cause greenhouse gas emissions, \nmainly due to their current dependence \non the fossil fuels oil and gas. Greenhouse \ngas emissions from plastics start with the \nextraction of oil and gas, because it requires \nlarge amounts of energy. Greenhouse gas \n\nIn the past decade, there has also been \na global shift in the choice of feedstocks \nused to produce plastics. Whereas the \nmain feedstock historically was naphtha, a \nproduct derived from oil refining, natural gas \nliquids are increasingly being used. These \nare lighter hydrocarbons, mainly ethane and \npropane, found in natural gas reserves in \nsome regions such as the Middle East and \nin shale gas reserves in the United States. \n\nShale gas extraction, in particular, is known \nto have significant impacts on natural areas, \nas large areas are used and contaminated in \nthe process. US ethane exports have grown \nrapidly following the expansion of shale gas \nproduction, and since 2016 a significant share \nof exports goes to Europe (US EIA, 2020). Thus, \nthe EU is increasingly using environmentally \ndamaging shale gas imported from the United \nStates to produce plastics.\n\nemissions are a result of the combustion of \nnatural gas in turbines and diesel in engines \nto fulfil the energy demands of the drilling \nmachinery and pump and compressor \noperations (Norwegian Environment Agency, \n2020a). Large numbers of trucks emitting \ngreenhouse gases are also needed at the \nwell sites to transport water and waste \n(CIEL,\u00a02019).\n\f\n33\n\nFigure 10.

Using high pressure water and chemicals,  \n fissures are opened in the shale so that gas is released and can be extracted.\nSource:  IVL.\n\nIn addition to emitting the most common \ngreenhouse gas, CO2, the extraction of oil and \ngas is also a significant emitter of methane. \nMethane emissions occur when natural gas \nmoves through the system, from production \nto distribution. Examples of activities that \nmay cause methane emissions are intentional \nventing and unintentional leaks from \npipelines and gas engines (US EPA, 2018).\n\nAs oil and gas fields get older, the greenhouse \ngas emissions generally increase, as more \nenergy is needed to clean greater quantities \nof contaminated water or for injecting \nmore water into the bedrock (Norwegian \nEnvironment Agency, 2020b). In some places, \nonshore oil and gas extraction causes land \ndisturbance and indirect greenhouse gas \nemissions, as forests and fields are removed \n\f\n34\n\nexample, chemicals are needed when \ndrilling to lubricate and cool the drilling bit \n(OSPAR, 2017). Although the concentrations \nof dispersed oil and hazardous substances \nare generally low in the produced water, \nthe large amounts of water make the \nquantities relevant. For example, produced \nwater and shipping are the largest emitters \nof oil into the North Sea. The amount of \nproduced water increases as the oil and gas \nfields get older (Norwegian Environment \nAgency,\u00a02020b).\n\nThe emissions of oil and toxic chemicals \nfrom produced water may have negative \nimpacts on sea animals, but the \nconsequences at ecosystem level are \nnot fully understood (Figure 11). Another \nenvironmental risk is oil spill, as this may \ncause both acute and long-term effects on \nlife at sea. The installation and removal of \noil platforms, as well as drilling operations, \nalso affect the local environment, depending \non how sensitive the area in question is \n(Norwegian Environment Agency, 2020b).\n\nHydraulic fracturing, a technique to improve \nthe flow of the oil or gas from the well, \nis further associated with risks such as \ndegrading groundwater and surface water \nquality due to waste fluid disposal, spills of \nchemicals and the reducing water availability \n(USGS, 2020). Over 170 fracking chemicals \nare known to cause health problems such as \ncancer and damage to the immune system, \nespecially for those living near fracking sites \n(Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation,\u00a02019).\n\nto make way for oil fields, and consequently \nno longer absorb greenhouse gases. Refining \ncrude oil to oil products such as naphtha, \nstill the dominant route for plastics in the EU, \nconsumes large amounts of energy, as does \nsteam cracking (CIEL, 2019).\n\nPollution of air, water and land arising from \noil and gas extraction\n\nOil and gas extraction for plastic production \nemits air pollutants, such as nitrogen \noxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), \nparticular matter\u00a0(PM), volatile organic \ncompounds\u00a0(VOCs), heavy metals, and a wide \nrange of chlorinated and other toxic organic \nchemicals (US EPA, 2016). The emissions are \nmainly a result of fuel combustion in gas \nturbines and diesel engines that generate \nenergy for drilling operations, treatment of \nthe extracted oil and gas, and transport of \noil and gas to reception stations. Flaring or \nventing excess gases when extracting oil and \ngas likewise releases toxic chemicals to the \natmosphere (CIEL, 2019).\n\nBoth onshore and offshore oil and gas \nextraction result in large amounts of waste \nwater coming from the reservoirs. This \nis called produced water, and it contains \ndispersed oil and hazardous substances \nthat occur naturally in the reservoir, such as \nheavy metals, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl \nphenols and radionuclides. It also contains \nadded process chemicals, some of which \nare considered harmful in terms of toxicity, \nbioaccumulation and biodegradation. For \n\f\n35\n\nImpacts of plastic production\n\n\u2022 Every year, the production of plastics \nin the EU is responsible for emitting \n13.4\u00a0million tonnes of CO2, which is about \n20\u00a0% of the chemical industry\u2019s emissions \nEU-wide.\n\nFigure 11.

The chemicals sector is \nthe production sector using the most energy  \nin the world, ahead of the iron and steel, \ncement, pulp and paper, and aluminium \nindustries, as shown in Figure 12 (OECD and \nIEA, 2018), and is the third largest source \nof industrial CO2 emissions. With about \n\nFigure 12.

Direct CO2 emissions includes energy and process  \n emissions in the industry sector; Mtoe, million tonnes of oil equivalent; MtCO2, million tonnes  \n of carbon dioxide. \nSource:  Reproduced from OECD and IEA (2018). \n\f\n37\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from plastics \nproduction in the EU are, not surprisingly, \nmuch higher when emissions over the whole \nlifecycle are considered i.e. including direct \nand indirect emissions and upstream activities \nsuch as oil extraction and refining/cracking. \nIn this different perspective, greenhouse gas \nemissions related to the EU plastic value chain \nfor resin production have been estimated to \nbe as high as 132 million tonnes CO2e in 2018 \n(ETC/WMGE, forthcoming). Converting these \npolymers to plastic components and products \naccounts for an additional 46 million tonnes \n(ETC/WMGE, 2020). \n\nPollution of air and water arising from \nplastic\u00a0production\n\nNOx and SOx are emitted by the plastic \npolymer manufacturing sector in significant \nquantities and are well known for their effect \nas acidifying substances. Acidification may lead \nto the spread of toxic metals, as it increases \nthe mobility of the metals in the environment. \nToxic metals such as lead, cadmium and \nmercury, as well as toxic organic compounds, \nare also emitted to air and water during plastic \nproduction. These may accumulate in animals \nand plants and are of concern, mainly because \nof their undermining health effects. They also \npersist in the trophic webs, leading to higher \nconcentrations further up the food chain \n(EEA,\u00a02019a). VOCs in combination with NOx \nalso participate in the atmosphere\u2019s chemistry, \nleading to various environmental phenomena, \nthe generation of toxic tropospheric ozone \nbeing the most important.\n\nPlastics production and waste is also \nresponsible for increased levels of nutrients \nin water systems, which lead to an ecosystem \n\nalteration known as eutrophication. When \nnutrients increase in a water body, the balance \nacross species changes, fostering increased \nalgal growth. When the algae die, they are \ndegraded in the water body, which causes \na reduction in its oxygen concentration \nand leads to a very significant decrease in \nbiodiversity (EEA, 2019a).\n\nImpacts of plastic consumption, \nlittering and micro-plastics\n\n\u2022 When using plastic products in their daily \nlives, consumers may be exposed to \ntoxic substances through the migration \nof particles, additives, impurities and \ndegraded\u00a0chemicals.\n\n\u2022 Abundance of plastic litter on land and \nin oceans, seas and freshwater is one of \nthe most visible aspects of the increasing \nproduction and use of plastics. 40\u00a0% of \nplastic items found in European freshwater \nenvironments are consumer-related \nproducts, such as bottles, food wrappers \nand cigarette butts.\n\n\u2022 Plastic pollution in the environment can \nhave detrimental effects on wildlife, \nprimarily because of entanglement, injuries \nand ingestion. More research is needed into \nthe effects of micro-plastics, including on \nmarine biota and human health.\n\nChemical toxicity to humans and nature \narising from plastic use\n\nMany negative health impacts including \nreproductive disorders, behavioural disorders, \ndiabetes and obesity, asthma and cancers \nhave been associated to exposure to \n\f\n38\n\nvarious chemicals used in plastics, such as \nflame retardants, endocrine disrupters and \nphthalates (HEAL, 2020). \n\nConsumers and users can be exposed to \ntoxicity through the migration of particles, \nadditives, impurities and degraded chemicals, \nmostly during the first use but also during \nsubsequent uses of plastics. Only limited \nrisk assessments have been performed \nfor chemicals authorised to be used in, for \nexample, food contact plastics, and several \nmaterials used in multilayer plastic materials \ndo not have specific legislation that requires \nauthorisation before use.\n\nFor single-use plastics, exposure is typically \nhigher than for repeated-use plastics. This is \nbecause it is mainly the chemicals that are not \nbound to the plastic that migrate, and most of \nthe migration happens the first time the plastic \nis used.\n\nAlthough additives play an important role \nin improving the properties of plastics, we \nknow that chemicals used as additives can \nmigrate from macro- and micro-plastics \ninto the environment and lead to human \nexposure (Hahladakis et al., 2018). For many \nof the substances used as additives, there \nare still uncertainties about their hazardous \nproperties and risks to human health and the \nenvironment (ECHA, 2019).\n\nThe migration of chemicals into nature and \nhumans depends on a number of factors: the \ntype of substance, the concentration of the \n\nsubstance in the plastic, the surface area of \nthe product, and how and where the plastic \nproduct is used, for example the temperature \n(ECHA, 2019). Additives are usually not \nchemically bound to the plastic structure, so \nthey can potentially migrate/leach from the \nplastic product into a medium in contact with \nthe product or migrate through the plastic to \nits surface (Hahladakis et al., 2018).\n\nIn nature, environmental factors such \nas temperature and the availability of \nmicroorganisms influence the leaching of \nchemical substances from plastics (Teuten \net\u00a0al., 2009) including resin pellets, fragments \nand microscopic plastic fragments, \ncontain organic contaminants, including \npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs. In addition, \nthere are considerable differences between \nmacro- and micro-plastics. Macro-plastics \nare of key concern for marine animals that \nmay, for example, get tangled in fishing \nnets or eat plastics. There is less known \nabout the risks of micro- and nano-plastics \nto humans, animals and the environment. \nChemicals from plastics may enter animals \ndirectly, if they mistake plastics for food, \nor indirectly via the food chain. This may \nresult in a higher chemical concentration \nthan that of the source and is common in \nanimals higher up the food pyramid, such as \nbirds and marine mammals. At lower trophic \nlevels, for example plankton, fish, bivalves \nand molluscs, the major intake of chemicals \noccurs passively via the surface of the \nbody or via respiratory organs by diffusion \n(Blastic, 2018).\n\f\nPlastics in the environment\n\nPlastics end up everywhere in the \nenvironment: in air, soil, freshwater, seas, \nbiota and some components of our food. \nPlastics of various sizes are released into \nthe environment, from large plastic items \nsuch as plastic bags and bottles to smaller \nparticles found in textiles and cosmetics \nor released from car tyres. It has been \nshown that that plastic waste enters the \nocean at a rate of 11 million metric tons per \nyear, harming mariner life and damaging \nhabitats (The Pew Charitable Trusts and \nSYSTEMIQ, 2020). Over 200.000 tonnes of \nplastic waste enters the Mediterranean Sea \nevery year, a number that is expected to \ndouble if significant measures are not taken \n(IUCN,\u00a02020).\n\nLarger plastic items in the environment may \nfragment and degrade into micro-plastics. \nRecent research estimates that at least \n14.4\u00a0million tonnes of microplastics have \nfound its way to the bottom of the world\u2019s \noceans (Barrett et al., 2020). The extent and \nspeed of this fragmentation depends on the \ntype of plastic and the exposure to sunlight, \nhigh temperatures, wind and waves. The \nmajority of plastics are not biodegradable in \nmarine conditions but will gradually break \ndown into micro- and nano-plastics through \nwear and tear and other mechanical action \n(Velis et al., 2017). In general, knowledge of \necological and health risk of microplastic \nis surrounded by considerable uncertainly \n(EC, 2019b).\n\nPlastics on a beach/ \u00a9 Pixabay 39\n\f\n40\n\nBox 5. Different sizes of plastics in the environment\n\nPlastics in the environment are usually categorised into macro-plastic, micro-plastic \nand\u00a0nano-plastic.\n\nMacro-plastics are generally referred to as plastic particles larger than 5 mm. Particles smaller \nthan 5 mm are called micro-plastics, and plastics smaller than 0.1 mm are called nano-plastics. \nKnowledge about the fate, risks and effects of nano-plastics in the environment is very limited \n(SAPEA, 2019).\n\nMicro- and nano-plastics can be released either as so-called primary micro-plastics or as secondary \nmicro-plastics. Primary micro-plastics are emitted to the environment in their original shape, \nfor example from washing textiles and as microbeads in cosmetics and personal care products. \nMicro-plastics can also originate from the fragmentation of macro-plastics (secondary micro-plastics; \nsee Figure 13), for example from the wear and tear of plastic litter or abrasion of car tyres \n(UNEP,\u00a02018).\n\nFigure 13. The breakdown of a plastic bottle into smaller fragments, eventually  \n                   ending up as micro- and nano-plastics\n\nSource:    IVL.\n\f\n41\n\nSynthetic fibres \nfrom laundering textiles\n\nAbrasion of vehicle tyres, \nplastic coatings and paints\n\nSanitary items\nand cosmetic products\n\nRelease from artificial \nturfs and playgrounds\n\nThere are many sources of plastics in the environment, including: \n\nPlastics spread to the environment through, for example:\n\nLittering Sewage effluents from\nwaste water treatment\nplants and the run-off \nof sewage sludge\n\nStorm water run-off Snow disposal Atmospheric deposition\n\nFishing and shipping activities Uncontrolled dumping, \nfly-tipping and littering\n\nEscape of plastics from \nmismanaged waste activities\n\nPellet loss from plastic\nproduction facilities\n\nFigure 14. Sources and pathways of plastics in the environment\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nThe majority of plastics found in the marine \nenvironment in Europe and elsewhere are \ncarried there by rivers. Litter studies in \nEuropean freshwater environments show \nthat around 40\u00a0% of the identifiable plastic \nlitter items were consumer-related products, \nmostly consisting of bottles, food wrappers \nand cigarette butts (Earthwatch Institute, \n2019). Results from modelling show that \nmost micro-plastics exported by rivers to \nseas in Europe are synthetic polymers from \ncar tyres and plastic-based textiles from \nlaundry (SAPEA, 2019).\n\nThe effects of plastics in the environment \nare not fully known. Risks are associated \nwith the size of plastics. Macro-plastics \nsuch as plastic bags, lost fishing gear and \nropes may have detrimental effects on \nanimals because of entanglement, injuries \nor ingestion. To some species, plastics \nresemble their ordinary feeding sources, for \nexample for sea turtles transparent plastic \nbags look similar to jellyfish (UNEP, 2018).\n\nSeabird nesting on fishing nets \u00a9Pixabay42\n\f\n43\n\nBox 7. Marine Litter Watch \n\nMarine Litter Watch is an ongoing EEA initiative launched in 2014 to better understand the \ncomposition, movement and origin of beach litter and to combat plastic litter. By using the Marine \nLitter Watch app, communities and the public can organise beach clean-ups and record the litter \nthey find on beaches using specific guidelines. The data are used to increase the knowledge base \non beach litter and support policymaking under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and \nthe Single Use Plastics Directive. The top 10 litter items reported to Marine Litter Watch between \nJanuary 2014 and October 2020 are displayed in Figure 15 below. The percentages are calculated \nbased on the total number of items collected. Together, these items represent 60\u00a0% of the litter \nreported (EEA, 2020c).\n\nFigure 15.

Smaller plastic items may be \nmistaken for food or enter organisms \nthrough filtration (e.g. in fish and mussels). \nAll species of marine turtles, almost 60\u00a0% of \nwhale species, 36\u00a0% of seal species and 40\u00a0% \nof seabird species have been documented as \ningesting plastics (Kuhn et al., 2015).\n\nThere is some knowledge of the \nconcentrations of micro-plastics in ocean \nsurface waters and freshwaters, but similar \ninformation regarding air and soil is very \nlimited. However, there are indications that \nmicroplastics in air, freshwater and soil are \nin need to be addressed similarly to marine \nmicroplastics (SAPEA, 2019). Micro-plastics \nhave a negative effect on food consumption, \ngrowth, reproduction and survival. High \nlevels of exposure to micro-plastics may \ncause inflammation and stress, as well as \nblockage of the gastrointestinal or respiratory \ntracts, reducing energy uptake or respiration. \nHowever, the extent to which this is happening \nin nature is not known. The concentrations \nof micro-plastics used in laboratory studies \nare much higher than those found in the \nenvironment (SAPEA, 2019).\n\nThe intake of micro- and nano-plastics \nthrough food and drink could pose a threat \nto human health. It is, however, not possible \nto assess human exposure to micro- and \nnano-plastics because of a lack of validated \n\nand standardised methods. At present, \nthe impacts of micro- and nano-plastic \ncontamination of food and beverages is \nlargely unknown (Toussaint et al., 2019).\n\nImpacts of plastic waste \nmanagement\n\n\u2022 Estimates suggest that 20-30\u00a0million \ntonnes of plastic waste is incinerated \nin Europe annually, leading to CO2 \n\nemissions of around 50-80\u00a0million tonnes \nper year.\n\n\u2022 Of the 29\u00a0million tonnes of plastic waste \ncollected in Europe in 2018, 32\u00a0% was \ncollected for recycling. Recycling rather \nthan incinerating plastics can reduce \nemissions by 1.1-3.0\u00a0tonnes of CO2 \nequivalent (CO2e).\n\nIn addition to the growth in production, \nuse and consumption of plastics \u2014 and \nthe resulting direct environmental and \nclimate impacts \u2014 the generation of plastic \nwaste is also an issue, as it constitutes \na considerable problem for waste \nmanagement systems globally. Plastics \ntoday constitute a significant part of the \ntotal waste generated in Europe.\n\nHumans have already produced a \ncumulative global total of over 8\u00a0billion \ntonnes of plastics since 1950, of which \n6.3\u00a0billion tonnes became waste in 2015 \n(Figure 16). It has been projected that \nover 25 billion tonnes of plastic could be \ngenerated by 2050, much of which could \nend in landfills or the natural environment \n(Geyer et al., 2017).\n\f\n45\n\nIn 2018, 29\u00a0million tonnes of plastic waste \nwas collected in Europe (EU-28, Norway and \nSwitzerland), of which it has been estimated \nthat 32\u00a0% was sent for recycling, 43\u00a0% \nwas incinerated and 25\u00a0% was landfilled \n(PlasticsEurope, 2019). Whereas countries \n\nin north-western Europe have banned or \nrestricted landfilling and thus incinerate \nthe majority of plastic waste generated, \nlandfilling is still the dominant treatment \nstrategy for plastic waste in southern \nEurope, as shown in Figure 17. \n\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050\n\nPrimary waste generated All waste discarded All waste incinerated All waste recycled\n\n25 000\n\n20 000\n\n15 000\n\n10 000\n\n5 000\n\n0\n\nMillion metric tonnes\n\nFigure 16.

Figure 18 shows the global \n\nproduction of plastics for different end-use \nsegments and the plastic waste generated \nin each of these.

Of these \noptions, recycling is far more beneficial \nto the environment and climate than \nincineration or landfilling, the last option \nbeing the least favourable. Overall, waste \nprevention is the most preferable option \n(EEA, 2019b). \n\nImpacts of recycling plastic waste\n\nThe recycling of plastics reduces raw \nmaterial extraction and the production \nof virgin plastics and therefore leads \nto reduced greenhouse gas emissions. \nRecycling instead of incinerating plastics \ncould reduce emissions by 1.1\u20133.0\u00a0tonnes of \nCO2e, compared with producing the same \n\nSource: Based on data from Geyer et al.

At the same time, recycling requires \nwaste to be collected, sorted and processed, \nwhich in turn requires fuel consumption \n(OECD and IEA, 2018).\n\nCollection for recycling of plastic waste range \nfrom about 20\u00a0% in Bulgaria and Finland, \nto more than 40\u00a0% in Spain and Norway. \nAlthough many types of plastics can be \nrecycled in principle, they are most often \nnot because of the complexity involved, \nincluding issues such as the sorting of \nmany different types of plastics and the \ncombination of various plastics in one plastic \nmaterial. As a result, a large share of the \nplastics that are collected for recycling are \nlater discarded in the recycling process. \n\f\nFrom the 21 million tonnes of plastic waste \ncollected annually in the EU between 2016 \nand 2019, 5.2 million tonnes of recycled \nplastics were used in new products each \nyear (Circular Plastics Alliance, 2020). \n\nAs packaging is the segment with the largest \ndemand for plastics, it is also the largest \nplastic waste stream, as shown in Figure 18. \nRecycling rates for plastic packaging have \nsteadily improved over the past decade. \nAt the same time, however, the amount of \nplastic packaging waste has also increased, \nwhich means that the overall quantity \nof non-recycled material has remained \nstable (ECA, 2020). Today, only about 40\u00a0% \nof plastic packaging waste is recycled \nin the EU-28, Norway and Switzerland \n(PlasticsEurope,\u00a02019).\n\nWhen recycling end-of-life vehicles and \nelectronic waste, more valuable metals \nare prioritised over plastics, leading to a \nlow recycling rate for plastics from these \nproducts. Furthermore, these products \noften contain types of plastics or additives \nthat create barriers to recycling, such as \ncomposite materials and flame retardants, \nwhich are not allowed in other applications. \nAlso, some of the additives in plastics are \nhazardous and therefore these plastics \ncannot be recycled as they would recirculate \nthe hazardous substances.\n\nApart from traditional mechanical recycling, \nthere is currently growing interest in \ndifferent processes for the chemical \nrecycling of plastics. Chemical recycling can \nbe done in different ways, with different \nimpacts on the plastic material \u2014 from \npurification to feedstock conversion.\n\n\u00a9 Pexels48\n\f\n49\n\nBox 8. Chemical recycling \n\nPlastic recycling is dominated by mechanical recycling, that is, processes in which plastics are \nsorted by polymer type and colour and then re-melted and undergo regular conversion processes \nfor the production of plastic goods. A new type of recycling process and technology, grouped \ntogether under the umbrella term \u2018chemical recycling\u2019 (Figure 19), has gained traction and given \nrise to discussions in recent years, in terms of business and recycling opportunities, as well as \nenvironmental risks and the lack of a sufficient knowledge base.\n\nChemical recycling offers potential new ways of expanding recycling so that it includes types of \nplastics and products that are difficult to recycle mechanically. Examples include plastics that are \nmixed with other materials or types of plastics, or are contaminated by hazardous chemicals. \nIn chemical recycling, plastics can be converted, decomposed or purified by advanced chemical \nprocesses into their building blocks (monomers) or oil, which can be purified and used again, as \nshown in Figure 19 (Crippa et al., 2019; PlasticsleMag, 2019).\n\nThere is a significant lack of knowledge about the overall life cycle impacts of chemical recycling on \nthe environment. There are indications, however, that chemical recycling works only under very \nspecific and narrow conditions and that it consumes energy, water and chemical resources that \nincrease the pollution of water, air and land. Volatile chemicals may also be generated during the \npyrolysis and purification steps, and, if not carefully captured, they may be emitted to the air as \npollution. If chemical recycling is to become a more widely used technology, it will be important to \nexplore the environmental and climate implications and risks as well as the financial costs in more \ndetail to determine whether there is an overall benefit to this type of recycling.\n\nFigure 19.

The carbon content typically \nrepresents 50-80\u00a0% of the weight of plastics, \ndepending on the type (OECD and IEA, 2018).\n\nOn average, 2.7\u00a0tonnes of CO2 are released \nfor every tonne of incinerated plastics (not \ntaking into account the potential carbon \nsavings of replacing it with another source of \nenergy) (Material Economics, 2019). The total \namount of plastic waste incinerated in the \nEU is uncertain, but estimates suggest that \nit is 20-30\u00a0million tonnes annually (Material \nEconomics, 2019). This means that the total \nCO2 emissions from the incineration of \nplastics in the EU would be somewhere in \nthe region of 50-80\u00a0million tonnes per year.\n\nImpacts of landfilling of plastic waste\n\nThe third and least favourable waste \ntreatment option from an environmental \nperspective \u2014 landfilling \u2014 could, at least in \ntheory, be regarded as a way of storing and \npostponing the release of carbon present \nin plastics. The fate of plastics in landfills \nis not fully understood, and the potential \ndecomposition of plastics over hundreds \nof years may eventually lead to a leakage \nof greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. \nFires on landfills (legal or illegal) also lead to \nuncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions. The \nEU has adopted a zero-landfill target to be \nachieved by 2030 for recyclable waste such as \nplastics. The future options for plastic waste \nin the EU will therefore favour recycling and \nreuse over landfilling and incineration.\n\nWaste incineration plant Spittelau, Vienna \u00a9 Pixabay50\n\f\n51\n\nBox 9. Bio-based, biodegradable and compostable plastics\n\nRecently, the EEA (2020b) has shown that more and more plastic products are labelled as \n\u2018compostable\u2019, \u2018biodegradable\u2019, \u2018oxo-degradable\u2019 or \u2018bio-based\u2019. Biodegradable, compostable and \nbio-based plastics need clearer labelling and repeated awareness-raising campaigns targeting users \nto ensure their correct disposal and treatment.\n\nBio-based plastics are fully or partly derived from biomass, such as maize, sugarcane and \ncellulose. Many of the conventional plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene \nterephthalate, are available on the market as bio-based or partially bio-based. They can be \ndesigned to have the same chemical structure and properties as fossil-derived versions, making \nthem technically equivalent to their fossil counterparts. The production of feedstock for bio-based \nplastics requires land, which is closely linked to direct and indirect environmental impacts on soil, \nbiodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and water (Spierling et al., 2018).\n\nPlastics marketed as biodegradable or compostable can be made from biomass or fossil resources \nor from a combination of the two. Compostable plastics can biodegrade under the conditions of an \nindustrial composting plant, but they do not fully compost in home composting bins or the natural \nenvironment. Biodegradable plastics can biodegrade in the environment, but only under certain \nconditions. These conditions depend on, for instance, temperature, the duration of the process, and \nthe presence of microorganisms, nutrients, oxygen and moisture. Given this, many plastics labelled \nas compostable or biodegradable do not biodegrade if they end up in the open environment or they \ndon\u2019t degrade quickly enough to avoid being harmful to marine life or the accumulation of plastic in \nthe environment (EEA, 2020b).\n\nThe fact that bio-based and biodegradable plastics are often mistaken for being biodegradable in \nthe natural environment is highly problematic. Today, an increasing number of plastic products \nare labelled as compostable or biodegradable, and a myriad of different labels and claims of \nbiodegradability or compostability exists. Together with the uncertainty around different plastic \ntypes, the many labels risk confusing citizens as to how they should dispose of such products. \nThis confusion may even increase littering if consumers misinterpret these labels as a \u2018licence to \nlitter\u2019. A clearer labelling system, as well as enhanced awareness-raising and communication with \nconsumers, is therefore important to ensure proper disposal.\n\nThe demand for bio-based, biodegradable and compostable plastics is continuously increasing. \nHowever, so far, they only make up around 1\u00a0% of global plastic production, with packaging the \nlargest field of application (European Bioplastics, 2019). Although biodegradable and compostable \nplastics can technically be circulated within the economy through recycling, they currently are not.\n\nSource:    EEA (2020b).\n\f\n\u00a9 Stipe Sura\u0107, Sustainably Yours /EEA52\n\f\n53\n\nThe road ahead: towards a circular \nplastics economy\n\nInnovation, business models, societal awareness and new policies are gradually changing \nthe way we produce, use, recycle and dispose of plastics. Many barriers to achieving \ncircular and more sustainable production and consumption of plastics remain. Given the \nmultiple environmental and climate impacts that exist across the life cycle of plastics, the \nshift towards a circular economy requires circular business models, changed consumption \npatterns and policies. These should address all stages in the plastic product life cycle and \nconsider the many different types of and uses of plastics. \n\nPolicies and business models\n\nPolicies towards a circular plastics economy\n\nPlastic has received growing EU policy \nattention in recent years. In 2018, the \nEuropean Commission presented the world\u2019s \nfirst comprehensive strategy on plastics in \na circular economy, which lays out the EU\u2019s \napproach to addressing the challenges of \nplastics. The strategy aims to curb plastic \nleakage into the environment and to ensure \nthat plastic products are designed and \nproduced in a way that allows for circularity, \nincluding through reuse and recycling. \nEmphasising the strong business case for \nEuropean industries to take the lead towards \na circular plastics economy, the strategy \nintroduces four overarching aims of the \ninitiative. These include the aim to improve \nthe economics and quality of plastics \nrecycling, curb plastic waste and littering, \ndrive investments and innovation towards \ncircular solutions, and harness global action.\n\nAs a main component of the European \nGreen Deal, the new Circular Economy \nAction Plan (EC, 2020), put forward in \n\nMarch\u00a02020 by the European Commission, \npresents a range of policy initiatives that \nwill move the EU towards a more circular \neconomy. Building on the efforts of the \nEU\u00a0Plastics Strategy, the Action Plan targets \nplastics as a key product value chain. It \ncontains concrete commitments to develop \nmandatory requirements for recycled \ncontent and waste reduction measures for \nselected products, to restrict the presence \nof micro-plastics in the environment, to \ncreate a policy framework on bio-based and \nbiodegradable plastics, and to ensure the \ntimely implementation of the Directive on \nSingle Use Plastics (EU, 2019; EC, 2020).\n\nThe increased focus on plastics and \ncircularity in EU strategies has also resulted \nin the adoption of new directives and \nthe amendment of existing ones. In line \nwith increased awareness of the negative \nenvironmental impacts associated with \nsingle-use plastics, the European Council \nadopted the Single Use Plastic (SUP) Directive \n(EU, 2019) in May 2019. With the objectives \nof preventing single use plastic waste and \nincreasing recycled content in the products, \nthe SUP Directive bans, from 2021 onwards, \n\f\n54\n\n10 of the most common plastic objects \nfound polluting European beaches for \nwhich alternatives exist. These items include \ncotton bud sticks, cutlery, plates, straws, \nstirrers, sticks for balloons, certain food \nand beverage containers and all products \nmade of oxo-degradable plastics. The SUP \nDirective also introduces economic incentives \nto reduce consumption and establish \nhigher collection rates, along with extended \nproducer responsibility (EPR) schemes.\n\nEPR schemes increase producers\u2019 \nresponsibility when their product turns \ninto waste. The aim is to incentivise \nproducers to improve collection and waste \nmanagement of their products and to \nclose the loop through better design and \nhigher recyclability/reusability of their \nproducts. Such EPR schemes are also \nimplemented through EU directives on \nbatteries and accumulators (EU, 2006), \nelectrical and electronic waste (EU, 2012), \nend-of-life vehicles (EU, 2000) and packaging \n(EU,\u00a02018b). The last three cover product \ncategories with a high plastic content and \nalso represent some of the largest demand \nsegments for plastics. These products are \nthus collected separately, which allows \ndedicated recycling systems.\n\nIn addition, several waste management \ndirectives have been revised to include \nnew targets specifically on plastics. These \ninclude the 2015 EU Directive\u00a02015/720 \non lightweight plastic carrier bags, which \nstipulates that Member States should reduce \nthe consumption of lightweight plastic bags \nby setting a target of 40 bags per person \nby 2025 and/or introducing measures that \nprevent carrier bags being provided free \n\nof charge by 2018 (EU, 2015). The Waste \nFramework Directive (EU, 2018a) has likewise \nbeen revised with new recycling targets for \nmunicipal waste and packaging, and landfill \nreduction targets. By 2025, 55\u00a0% of municipal \nwaste needs to be recycled (60\u00a0% by 2030), \nand by 2025 50\u00a0% of plastic packaging must \nbe recycled (55\u00a0% by 2030).\n\nIn response to the growing awareness \naround marine plastic pollution, there has \nalso been a range of international actions. \nThese come first and foremost from a \ngrowing number of civil society initiatives \naimed at limiting the consumption of \nsingle-use plastic items and cleaning up \nwaste items. In recent years, business \nand governments have also begun to \ndiscuss how they may take stronger, more \ncoordinated action addressing marine plastic \npollution specifically, for example through \nvoluntary action and global agreements.\n\nIn relation to this, trade in plastic waste \nhas also risen up the international political \nagenda. As discussed in the section on trade \nin plastic waste, the effects of the 2017 \nChinese ban on imports of certain types of \nplastic waste led to significant changes in \nthe international plastic trade. In addition, \nthe revision of the Basel Convention (2019) \nencourages countries to take greater \nownership of and give more consideration to \ntheir plastic waste. \n\nIn the context of this plethora of initiatives, \ncoordinated action is needed to enable best \npractice to be shared between countries and \nregions and to scale up circular and more \nsustainable plastics initiatives. To this end, \nthe EU has a unique opportunity to play a \n\f\n55\n\nleading role when it comes to promoting \nsustainable plastic production and \nconsumption in the global arena. The new \ncircular Economy Action Plan sets out an \nambition to create a global circular economy \nalliance that can identify knowledge and \ngovernance gaps in transitioning towards a \nglobal circular economy.\n\nCircular and sustainable business models\n\nCurrent business models in the plastics \nindustry are dominated by traditional and \nvery linear business models enabling the \nextraction, production, consumption and \nwaste management of plastics, with little or \nno focus on circularity. Resource extraction \nis dominated by large multinational \ncompanies in the oil and gas industry \nwith high levels of international trade and \nimports and exports to and from Europe. \nThe many production phases related to \nplastics involve companies of many different \nsizes operating in Europe and elsewhere, \nand the same is the case in the waste \nmanagement phase.\n\nMoving towards more circular and \nsustainable business models in the \nplastics production and consumption \nsystem \u2014 often enabled through social \nand technological innovation \u2014 has huge \npotential for reducing environmental and \nclimate impacts.\n\nDuring resource extraction and use of \nmaterials for plastic production, innovation \nand circular business models can enable a \ngradual move from sourcing entirely virgin \nraw materials (mainly from oil and gas) \nto renewable resources and secondary \n\n\u00a9 Pexels\n\f\n56\n\nresources from the recycling and recovery \nof plastics. More circular product design is \nalso important. The choice and organisation \nof materials, including plastics, are the main \ndetermining factors for product and material \ncircularity. Basically, the aim should be to \nkeep the materials in the economy for as \nlong as possible.\n\nAlong with the environmental and climate \nimpacts of production, the logistics \nof the plastics supply chain, including \ntransport, storage and retail, affect \ncircularity\u00a0significantly.\n\nCircular business models can enable longer \nuse, reuse and repair of materials, while at \nthe end-of-life phase these business models \nare crucial to enable the sorting, recycling \nand remanufacturing of plastics. \n\nPathways towards circularity in \nthe longer term\n\nDespite increasing initiatives to change the \ncurrent plastics system, various stakeholders \nin business, policy and civil society often \npromote specific solutions aimed at \naddressing particular problems, such as \nlittering and low recycling rates. However, \ngiven the challenges associated with \n\ndifferent plastic applications and different \nstages of the life cycle, as explained in the \nprevious section, a single initiative will not \nsuffice to facilitate the trajectory towards a \ncircular plastics economy.\n\nRather than searching for a silver bullet \nsolution, this section presents three pathways \nthat may together ensure the continued \nlonger term move towards a sustainable and \ncircular plastics production and consumption \nsystem. These pathways should be seen \nnot as alternative options but rather as \npathways that are in line with current \npolicies and that offer options for continued \npolicy development towards circularity and \nsustainability in the longer term.\n\nThe three pathways are smarter use, \nincreased circularity and renewable material \n(Nielsen et al., 2018). Figure 20 illustrates \nthat each pathway addresses different \nstages of the plastics value chain, as well as \ndifferent environmental and climate impacts. \nFor each pathway, the following section \nexplores the problems it seeks to address, \nthe types of solutions it promotes, its \nlimitations, and the possibilities for further \naction. Policy action, circular business \nmodels and a changing role for consumers \nare important to all three pathways.\n\f\n57\n\nFigure 20.

Rather than merely relying on \ntechnological fixes such as better recycling \n\nsystems, this pathway aims to reduce \nthe projected growth curve of plastic \nproduction and consumption by using \nplastics in a smarter way.\n\nTypes of solutions it promotes\nA \u2018smarter use\u2019 of plastics entails a \nreduced use of plastics when this is \nbeneficial, coupled with a more effective \nuse of the plastic that is consumed. \nAchieving this requires significant \nchanges in current consumption patterns. \nNot only is it important for consumers to \nconsider the types of materials, products \nand services they use, but products \nshould also be used for longer, through \nreuse and repair, as enabled by circular \nbusiness models.\n\f\n58 Example of a reusable coffee cup \u00a9 Pixabay\n\nIt is also crucial to consider which types \nof plastics are used for which types of \napplications. For instance, reducing the \nnumber of different plastic types used for \npackaging through circular business models \ncan reduce complexity further down the \nvalue chain. It also means, in some cases, \nexchanging plastics with other materials \nwhile making sure that these materials do \nnot have higher environmental impacts. \nA smarter use likewise entails limiting the \nnumber of toxic elements in plastics.\n\nIn line with this pathway, there is a growing \nnumber of initiatives that aim to make \nusers more aware of how much plastic they \nconsume and the negative effects that this \ncan have. These initiatives range from civil \nsociety actions aimed at changing consumer \nhabits, such as encouraging reusable \ntakeaway coffee cups (Freiburg cup), to global \nefforts to clean up the large plastic patches \nin oceans (Ocean Cleanup) and more local \nefforts to clean beaches (Ocean Conservancy) \nor harbours (GreenKayak in Denmark). \nSeveral circular business models that \npromote longer life cycles of plastic products \nhave also come to light in recent years.\n\nA significant number of public and policy \ninitiatives aimed at curbing plastic waste and \nreducing consumption (of single-use plastics) \nalso exist. These range from the Single Use \nPlastics (SUP) Directive to bans and taxes \non plastic bags. In addition, there are an \nincreasing number of initiatives aimed \nat dealing with toxic elements in plastics, \nfrom bans on specific additives, such as \nbisphenol A in baby bottles (EU, 2011), to \nbans on micro-plastics in rinse-off cosmetics \nin France, Italy and Sweden, for example. \n\f\n59\n\nBox 10. Seven recommendations of the European Academies\u2019 Science Advisory \n              Council to transform the plastics system\n\nThe European Academies\u2019 Science Advisory Council recently published a report on plastics \npackaging in a circular economy that shows that fundamental changes along the entire value chain \nare required to slow and reverse environmental and climate impacts. The report includes seven \nmessages for EU policymakers on how to transform the plastics system. \n\n1. Ban exports of plastic waste to third countries\nRather than shipping huge amounts of plastic waste to third countries that often do not have the \nnecessary capacity to deal with it in a sustainable way, Europe should manage its own plastic waste. \nThis is better from both an environmental and an ethical perspective, even if part of the waste has \nto be recovered for energy.\n\n2. Adopt a target of zero plastic waste to landfill, and minimise consumption and one\u2011way use \nIn addition to adopting a target of zero plastic waste to landfill and making reduction in \nconsumption an explicit objective, policymakers should extend deposit refund schemes to cover a \nwider range of containers and single-use beverages.\n\n3. Extend producer responsibility (EPR)  \nAmbitious EPR schemes should include measures that facilitate product design choices that \nconsider end-of-life use and environmental impacts, such as toxicity, durability, reusability, \nrepairability and recyclability/compostability. \n \n4. End misleading information about bio-based alternatives  \nAt present, scientists see very limited potential for biodegradable plastics, as only a few products \nmeet biodegradation tests in the natural environment. Furthermore, consumers may be misled by \nthe diversity of existing labelling schemes and are often not aware of the environmental impacts \nassociated with bio-based alternatives. A uniform European labelling scheme that relates to the \nactual rather than theoretical recyclability of bio-based plastics should therefore be created.\n \n5. Advanced recycling and reprocessing technology  \nTo extract more value from plastic waste, advanced recycling and reprocessing technology must \nbe developed. In addition, recycling for use in the same product (closed-loop recycling) must be \nprioritised over other options, such as recycling for use in the production of different products \n(open-loop recycling) or energy recovery.\n\n6. Limit additives and types of resin to improve recyclability  \nTo increase the recyclability of plastics, the use of additives must be reduced and the number of \npolymers that can be used for specific products simplified.\n\n7. Price regulations and quotas for recycled content  \nThe current cost of virgin plastic feedstock is very low and does not include costs to the environment \nand climate. Policymakers should therefore adopt a regulatory and financial framework, including, \nfor instance, a plastics tax or a requirement for minimum recycled contents, that takes into account \nadverse impacts across the plastic product life cycle.\n\nSource:    EASAC (2020).\n\f\n60\n\nInformation encouraging more sustainable \nconsumption of plastics is also found \nin environmental product declarations, \non labels about types of plastic used in \npackaging and in guidelines for green \npublic\u00a0procurement.\n\nConstraints\nPlastics are very useful materials and \nsubstituting them with alternative materials \nis not always straightforward. It can be \ndifficult to determine the negative impact \nof specific plastic products compared with \nalternative materials (Spierling et al., 2018)\na review on available data from life cycle \nassessment (LCA). This, in turn, makes it \ndifficult to choose which plastic items to tax, \nban or redesign.\n\nSimilarly, using fewer types of plastics \nin certain applications may also lead to \nunintended negative impacts. For instance, \nalthough laminates used in plastic food \npackaging can complicate recycling, they \noffer advanced food protection, thereby \nreducing food waste while also reducing the \noverall amount of plastic used. The value \nof food protection is likely to outweigh the \ncost of poor mechanical recyclability in most \ncases, but such assessments may be difficult \nto make.\n\nPossibilities for further action\nInitiatives to reduce the use of plastics tend \nto focus on packaging, such as straws, cups \nand bottles. However, future initiatives could \nlook at other key plastic sectors, such as the \n\nautomotive industry (car tyres), textiles \n(synthetic textiles) and agricultural film, \nthat also pose significant challenges. In \naddition to widening the scope of action, \nstandards and guidelines on how to \nachieve a \u2018smarter use of plastics\u2019 could \nbe further developed and used as part of, \nfor example, green public procurement or \ncorporate social responsibility initiatives. \nAn overall goal would be to make plastic a \nmore \u2018valuable\u2019 product, both in economic \nterms, whereby the price reflects its \nenvironmental impacts, and in terms of \nhow consumers use and relate to it.\n\nThe increased circularity pathway\n\nThe main ambition under the \u2018increased \ncircularity pathway\u2019 is to transition from a \nlinear plastics economy to a circular plastics \neconomy, in which the value and utility of \nplastics is maintained within closed loops \nthrough, for example, circular business \nmodels enabling improved end-of-life \nmanagement and enhanced product\u00a0design.\n\nProblems it addresses\nA key problem with the current \ntake-make-dispose plastics system is that \nit leads to low resource efficiency and high \nmaterial and economic value losses, with a \ncontinuous input of virgin materials derived \nfrom the Earth\u2019s finite resources. This \npathway therefore addresses the (material) \ninefficiency of the plastics system, in \nwhich only a limited amount of plastics is \ncurrently conserved.\n\f\n61\n\nTypes of solutions it promotes\nProponents of this pathway focus on \ntechnical and systemic solutions, along \nwith circular business models that help \nunlock material and energy savings by \nenabling plastic waste to re-enter the \nsystem after use, thus replacing virgin \n\nraw materials in new products. This \nincludes improving the design of products \nand services, reducing the toxicity and \ncomplexity of applications, improving \ncollection and sorting, and promoting a \nmarket for recycled and reused plastics.\n\nBox 11. The \u2018New Plastics Economy\u2019: a vision for an economy in which plastics never \n               become waste\n\nLaunched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2016, the New Plastics Economy initiative envisages \na circular economy in which plastics never become waste. Instead, unnecessary plastics should be \nabolished, and innovation should ensure that all necessary plastics can be circulated within the \neconomy through reuse, recycling or composting. For plastic packaging specifically, the initiative \ndefines a circular economy by the following six characteristics:\n\n1. Eliminating problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging through redesign, innovation and \nnew delivery models is a priority.\n\n2. Reuse models are applied when relevant, reducing the need for single-use packaging.\n\n3. All plastic packaging is 100\u00a0% reusable, recyclable or compostable.\n\n4. All plastic packaging is reused, recycled or composted in practice.\n\n5. The use of plastic is fully decoupled from the consumption of finite resources.\n\n6. All plastic packaging is free of hazardous chemicals, and the health, safety and rights of all \npeople involved are respected.\n\nTogether with a wide set of stakeholders, the initiative takes a systemic approach to creating a \nshared vision and a common set of actions that can set an irreversible path towards creating the \nNew Plastics Economy.\n\nIt does so through several accompanying initiatives, such as the Global Commitment initiative, \nwhich was launched in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme. The Global \nCommitment initiative gathers more than 450 businesses, governments and organisations behind a \nset of targets aimed at tackling plastic waste and pollution at its source by 2025.\n\nTo contribute to reaching these targets across all regions, the Plastics Pact network brings together \nnational and regional initiatives that implement solutions towards a circular plastics economy. \nThe network also works as a platform for sharing knowledge and best practices related to the \ntransformation of the plastics system.\n\nSource:    Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2019).\n\f\n62\n\nExamples of these types of solutions and \ncircular business models can be found in the \ngrowing number of initiatives on a circular \n(plastics) economy that have been embraced \nby both the European Commission and \na wide range of companies and Member \nStates. This includes the increasing number \nof companies that present voluntary \ncommitments to using recycled plastics \nin their product lines or new design \n\nspecifications that increase recyclability. It \nalso includes policy tools, such as deposit \nrefund systems for PET (polyethylene \nterephthalate) bottles that are common in \nthe Nordic countries, and EPR schemes on \nplastic packaging in, for instance, France, the \nNetherlands and the United Kingdom. There \nis also a growing amount of investment \ngoing into improving waste management \ninfrastructures.\n\nConstraints \nThe constraints of this pathway include \nchallenges related to (mechanical) recycling \nand how to integrate the different steps \nalong the value chain. Key obstacles to \nplastic reuse and recycling include toxic \nelements in recycling streams, quality loss \nin the recycling process (downcycling), lack \nof transparency regarding polymers and \nadditives in plastic products, complexity \nof collecting and sorting, difficulties in \nrecycling laminate and thermoset plastics, \nand concerns over low market demand for \nrecycled plastics.\n\nPossibilities for further action  \nTo improve the traceability of all the different \nelements in plastics, new techniques such as \nmass-balance measurement could be scaled \nup. This would improve product information, \nincluding how much of a product is made from \n\nBox 12. The Circular Plastics Alliance\n\nIn 2018, the European Commission launched the Circular Plastics Alliance as part of the European \nstrategy for plastics. It aims to boost the EU market for recycled plastics to 10\u00a0million tonnes \nby 2025. The Alliance covers the full plastics value chain and includes over 175 organisations \nrepresenting industry, academia and public authorities (EC, 2019a).\n\nrecycled content, and enable a more gradual \nshift towards the use of recycled plastics. \nMoreover, recycling could be improved if \ncurrent fragmented waste management \npractices were more harmonised across \nregions, countries and the EU, and if deposit \nreturn systems were expanded to a broader \nrange of products and\u00a0sectors.\n\nHowever, circularity should not be reduced \nto simply improving recycling rates. It also \nnecessitates reuse, redesign of products and \nrethinking of the entire value chain. \n\nThe use of renewable raw material and \ndecarbonisation pathway\n\nThe central idea of this pathway is to reduce \nthe amount of plastics that is derived from \nfossil fuels (today more than 99\u00a0%) by \nswitching to renewable raw materials.\n\f\n63\n\nThe problem it addresses\nThis pathway highlights the plastic sector\u2019s \ndependence on fossil feedstock and the \nimplications of this in terms of energy and \nresource security, greenhouse gas emissions \nand a situation of \u2018petrochemical lock-in\u2019.\n\nTypes of solutions it promotes\nSolutions promoted under this pathway \nfocus on decoupling plastics from fossil \nfeedstock by switching \u2014 when more \nbeneficial \u2014 to renewable feedstock, in \nline with the broader EU actions on climate \nchange and the bioeconomy. In doing so, it \nfocuses more attention on the early stages \nof the value chain, compared with the other \npathways. A key solution is promoting a \nmarket for plastics made from alternative \nraw materials, often called bio-based \nplastics. These are plastics made fully or \npartly from biological feedstock, typically \noils, starches and sugars from agricultural \ncrops. Feedstocks can also include cellulose, \nbio-waste and even CO2.\n\nThe benefits of using renewable feedstock \ninclude reduced dependency on imports, \nreduced dependency on fossil resources, \nreduced greenhouse gas emissions and, if \nlocally sourced, increased rural development.\n\nThere are fewer examples of current \ninitiatives for this pathway than for the \nprevious two pathways. However, the new \nCircular Economy Action Plan will develop \na policy framework on bio-based plastics to \nassess in which cases bio-based feedstock \nleads to genuine environmental benefits \nbeyond the simple reduction in fossil fuel \nuse. In the EU Plastic Strategy, research \nand development projects are used as a \n\nMaize harvesting \u00a9 Pixabay\n\f\n64\n\npolicy instrument to promote renewable \nraw material for plastics at the EU level \n(EC, 2018). In addition, there are also a \nnumber of civil society and private sector \ninitiatives that promote plastic products \nsuch as packaging and toys made from \nrenewable\u00a0feedstock.\n\nConstraints\nA key concern for this pathway is the \ndiscussion around feedstock scarcity and \nthe implications for land use. A significant \nscaling up of bioplastics would, using \ncurrent production patterns, take up a \nsignificant part of global arable land, leading \nto competition for food, feed and other \nbio-based products.\n\nIn addition to issues concerning land use, \nconsumers often confuse bio-based plastics \nwith biodegradable and compostable \nplastics. Bio-based plastics are fully or partly \nderived from raw materials other than \nfossil fuels, while the term \u2018biodegradable \nplastics\u2019 indicates that a plastic application \nis compostable (under certain conditions). \nAnother central limitation is price. \nCurrently, virgin fossil-based plastics are \nrelatively cheap, and producers have \nto pay a premium for alternative raw \nmaterials. Finally, bio-based plastics such as \nbio-polypropylene (PP) and bio-polyethylene \n(PE) are identical to regular fossil-based PP \nand PE, which means that they do not solve \nproblems further down the value chain, such \nas leakage and recyclability.\n\nPossibilities for further action\nWhen it comes to land use competition and \navailability of feedstock, it is necessary to \ndiversify the source of non-fossil feedstocks \n\nto include second- and third-generation \nbiomass and carbon capture and use, for \nexample using captured CO2 to produce \nnew\u00a0plastics.\n\nSubsidies and upscaling initiatives from the \nbioeconomy strategy could help provide a \nmore level playing field when it comes to \nprice. Alternatively, a tax/levy on fossil-based \nplastic could be considered. It is also \nnecessary to develop more knowledge of the \nenvironmental impacts and energy demand \nfrom a scale-up of bio-based plastics \nproduction. Moreover, clearer information, \nstandards and labels are needed to address \nconsumer confusion.\n\nThere are pathways but no silver bullets\nTo reach a sustainable and circular use of \nplastics, different stages of the value chain \nas well as different types of environmental \nand climate impacts must be addressed. \nA combination of the three pathways \ndescribed above therefore offers a way \nforward for the longer term.\n\n\u2022 Smarter use focuses on production and \nuse to alleviate problems connected to \nleakage and toxicity, but it focuses less \nattention on the impacts on climate \nchange and other negative externalities.\n\n\u2022 Increased circularity aims to integrate \nthe entire value chain to improve the \ncircularity of plastics. This promises to deal \nwith many of the environmental impacts \nhighlighted in this report. However, \ncircular plastic economy initiatives often \ndo not address the expanding levels \nof consumption or the dependence of \nplastics on fossil resources.\n\f\n65\n\n\u2022 Renewable material takes up the fossil \nlock-in of plastics but does not focus \non their use and waste management. \nSwitching to renewable materials would \nnot in itself do much for the leakage \nproblem of plastics.\n\nAs is often the case with sustainability shifts \nand transitions, there are no silver bullets for \nsolving the challenges of plastics. We need \nto consider multiple pathways to address all \nthe challenges of plastics in the longer term. \nThis includes not only improving synergies \nbetween them but also acknowledging \npotential trade-offs (Nielsen et al., 2018). In \norder to implement a sustainable transition \nin the plastics economy, there is a need to \nreduce knowledge gaps on the negative \nimpacts of plastics and facilitate more \ncoordinated efforts along the value chain \nand across multiple sectors.\n\f\n\u00a9 Osman Kartal, Sustainably Yours /EEA66\n\f\n67\n\nWhat can you do as \na\u00a0consumer?\nWe are all consumers of plastics. Although the environmental and climate impacts of \nplastics are to a very large extent the result of the current production, consumption and \nwaste management system \u2014 with linear value chains, dependency on oil and gas, impact \nof chemicals, insufficient infrastructure, etc. \u2014 there are also a number of things citizens \ncan do, either in organised ways or as individuals.\n\nTo directly prevent the use of unnecessary \nor replaceable plastics (often for single use), \nconsumers can think twice before buying \nor using them. They may, for instance, \nsupport stores offering packaging-free \ngoods, or choose packaging made from \nalternative and perhaps reusable materials, \nsuch as wood, cotton and metal. Using \nless single-use plastics \u2014 for example \nfor cutlery, plates and cups \u2014 is also an \noption. However, choosing a product from \na different material may not always be the \nmost environmentally friendly solution, as \ndiscussed under the smarter use pathway.\n\nAs plastics are an omnipresent part of our \ndaily life, it is virtually impossible to avoid \nthem altogether. Sometimes plastic is \npreferable to other materials because of its \nlightweight nature and durability. If the use \nof plastics cannot be avoided, consumers \ncan instead opt for purchasing reusable \nplastic products and thus contribute to \nincreased circularity by keeping materials \nout of the waste stream. Whereas reusability \ndepends on several factors, such as a \n\nproduct\u2019s design and compliance with \nhygiene requirements, the willingness \nof consumers to favour reusable over \nsingle-use products is essential. Another \noption is to purchase products made from \nrecycled plastics if a more sustainable \nalternative material does not exist.\n\nIn the after-use phase when plastics \nhave become waste, consumers play a \ncentral role in determining the fate of \nplastics and ensuring that they are not \nleaked into the environment. High-quality \nwaste management systems are crucial \nfor enabling the proper separation of \nwaste. But consumers also need to make \nan effort to contribute to collection \nand recycling systems by ensuring \nthat recyclable plastics are not thrown \ninto the residual waste bin, or by using \navailable take-back systems for different \nproducts, such as empty cans and bottles, \nelectronic equipment and vehicles. In \naddition, avoiding littering of plastics in the \nenvironment is an obvious option for all \nconsumers and citizens.\n\f\n68\n\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, large \namounts of plastics have already escaped \nproper waste management and ended \nup as litter. There is a growing number \nof initiatives that aim to involve users in \ncapturing what has already been leaked. \nThese initiatives range from global efforts \nto clean up the large plastic patches in \nthe oceans (e.g. Ocean Cleanup) to more \nlocal efforts to clean beaches (e.g. Ocean \nConservancy) or harbours (e.g. GreenKayak \n\nBox 13. GreenKayak\n\nGreenKayak works to reduce the amount of rubbish floating in our coastal waters. The idea is \nsimple: volunteers get free GreenKayak trips in return for collecting waste. GreenKayak also shares \nknowledge and helps people of all ages to get out on the water and take action. GreenKayak \noperates in Copenhagen and other regions of Denmark and in some other European countries \n(GreenKayak, 2020).\n\nGreenKayak in action in Copenhagen \u00a9 GreenKayak\n\nin Denmark). Citizens and consumers can \nchoose to join such\u00a0initiatives. \n\nAlthough consumers can do a lot, it is the \ncurrent systems of plastic production and \nconsumption that are the major reason for \nunsustainable use of plastics. Businesses, \npolicymakers and other stakeholders in the \nplastics system have a responsibility to make \nit more sustainable and circular.\n\f\n69\n\nList of abbreviations \nand\u00a0acronyms \nBPA Bisphenol A\n\nCO2 Carbon dioxide\n\nCO2e Carbon dioxide equivalent\n\nCOVID-19 Coronavirus disease 2019\n\nEEA European Environment Agency\n\nEPR Extended producer responsibility\n\nEU European Union\n\nEU-28 The 28 EU Member States as of 1\u00a0July 2013 to 31\u00a0January 2020\n\nNOx Nitrogen oxides\n\nPE Polyethylene\n\nPM Particulate matter\n\nPP Polypropylene\n\nPVC Polyvinyl chloride\n\nSO2 Sulphur dioxide\n\nSOx Sulphur oxides\n\nSUP Single-Use Plastics\n\nVOC Volatile organic compound\n\f\n70\n\nReferences\nAgarwal, S. and Gupta, R.
