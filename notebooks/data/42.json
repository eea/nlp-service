{"query": "How much clothing is wasted per person?", "texts": ["On average, Europe has plenty of water to meet its needs, but large differences in climate makes water much less abundant in southern than in northern Europe. Our changing climate is likely to make the differences more extreme.\nIntroduction\nIn Europe, annual renewable freshwater resources are relatively abundant, amounting to a long term average 4,560 m3 per person. However, climatic variations cause considerable differences across Europe, ranging from 120 m3 per person per year in Malta, to 70,000 m3 per person per year in Norway. As climate is changing, renewable freshwater resources are also expected to change, becoming scarcer in already dry areas.\nDo you know?\nThe average household consumption of water in Europe is 53 m3 per person per year\nThe agricultural sector is the largest water consumer in Europe\nOver exploitation of water still occurs in parts of Europe\nStatus\nEEA has assessed Europe\u2019s water resources between 1990 and 2017, by source, by season, by economic sectors and by geographic area.\nIn Europe, most water is abstracted from surface waters. Around 75 % of total water abstraction is from rivers and reservoirs, and 25 % from groundwater. Abstraction rates are highest during the growing season (FIGURE 1 ).\nWater is used for agriculture (58%), energy cooling (18%), mining (11%) and households (10%). Thus, agriculture is the economic sector using the largest share of renewable water resources (FIGURE 2).\nFIGURE 1\nFreshwater abstraction in Europe by source, 2017\nSource: Use of freshwater resources in Europe. EEA Indicator Assessment, 2019\nFIGURE 2\nWater use in Europe by economic sector, 2017\nSource: Use of freshwater resources in Europe. EEA Indicator Assessment, 2019\nNote:\nThe pie chart shows the annual data for the year 2017 for water abstraction by source at the European level. The quarterly values have been used to show the development of seasonal water abstraction by source.\nQ1: January, February and March\nQ2: April, May and June\nQ3: July, August and September\nQ4: October, November and December\nData coverage\nEEA member countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom\nCooperating countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo (under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244/99)\nWater scarcity occurs where insufficient water resources are available to satisfy annual requirements. It refers to a situation of unbalanced use of water, where water demand for human activities systematically exceeds the water supplied by the natural system.\nWater scarcity is most frequent in southern Europe. This is particularly so during summer, because of higher abstractions from agriculture, public water supply and tourism. Because of very intensive irrigation, the Middle Apennines and the Po Basin (Italy), Guadiana (Portugal and Spain) and Segura (Spain), experience severe water scarcity throughout the year. Mediterranean islands, such as the Balearic islands, Crete and Sicily experience incessant and severe water stress conditions throughout the year, with agriculture and tourism exerting very high pressures. This is pattern is shown for 2015 in FIGURE 3.\nWater scarcity is, however, not limited to southern Europe. In other parts of Europe, urbanisation, combined with high abstractions from the energy and industrial sectors for cooling purposes and from the public water supply sector can also create water scarcity. Higher pressures than the regional average can be observed in the wider area of Copenhagen, London and Stockholm, and the river basins of the Loire, Meuse, Oder and Weser rivers. In addition, droughts also occur where water scarcity might not be perceived as a critical issue (e.g. in Scandinavia during the summer of 2018, the Elbe basin in the summer of 2015 and the Black Sea basin in 2007). This pattern is also shown for 2015 in FIGURE 3.\nFIGURE 3\nSeasonal water scarcity in European sub-basins expressed through water exploitation index (WEI+)\nResults for the winter and summer of 2015. Difference between winter and summer is primarily due to agricultural water use.\nSource: Water and agriculture: towards sustainable solutions. EEA Report No 17/2020\nNote\nAssessments of the sustainability of water abstraction at the European level remain limited by data availability and the approach to interpretation of water returns. This may lead to large differences in the European WEI compared to national datasets. An example of this occurs in the south-western subbasin of France along the Atlantic Coast, an important maize production area. There, the national estimate of WEI is around 50% because it adopts no water returns from agriculture, whereas the European estimate, which is based on 31 % returns ratio from agriculture, is below 10%.\nTrends\nWater abstraction has increased in southern Europe since 1990; by 30 % for electricity cooling, and by 9 % for agriculture. At the country level, trends in sectoral pressures vary considerably. For instance, water abstraction for agriculture has increased significantly in Turkey (70 %) and Greece (11 %), whereas water abstraction for electricity cooling has increased significantly in the Netherlands (23 %) and Slovenia (18 %) (FIGURE 4).\nOn average, EU Member States have made considerable progress towards reducing total water abstraction. The main improvements encompass improvements in water conveyance, efficiency gains in water use and socio-economic transformations, particularly in eastern Europe. Overall, total water abstraction has decreased by 17 % between 2000 and 2017.\nThe goal of reducing water abstraction to below 20 % of renewable freshwater resources, as set in the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe, has, however, not been achieved in all European river basins and does not look realistic in the short term.\nFIGURE 4\nThe development of water abstraction in Europe since the 1990s\nSource: Use of freshwater resources in Europe.

A wide-scale change towards circular economy in textiles production and consumption is needed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, resource use and pressures on nature.\nThe EEA briefing \u2018Textiles in Europe\u2019s circular economy\u2019 presents the latest evidence on environmental and climate impacts from the consumption of textile products ranging from clothing and footwear to carpets and furniture in the EU. The briefing is based on a technical report by the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE).\nAccording to the EEA study, the production and handling of clothing, footwear and household textiles that were sold in the EU in 2017 used an estimated 1.3 tonnes of primary raw materials and 104 cubic metres of water per EU person. About 85 % of these materials and 92 % of the water were used in other regions of the world.\nFor water consumption and the use of primary raw materials, clothing, footwear and household textiles represent the fourth highest consumption category in the EU, after food, housing and transport. The same product group causes the second highest pressure on land use (after food), and also a considerable amount of chemical and water pollution, including plastic microfibres released through washing, as well as various negative social impacts.\nThe EEA briefing also shows that the production of clothing, footwear and household textiles for Europeans caused an estimated 654 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions per EU capita, making textiles the fifth largest source of CO2 emissions linked to private consumption. About three quarters of these emissions took place outside of the EU.\nCircular economy policies and principles, such as eco-design and reusing, hold potential to mitigate the environmental and climate impacts of textile production and consumption, the EEA briefing states. Current EU policies require Member States to collect textiles separately by 2025 and ensure that waste collected separately is not incinerated or landfilled.\nAccording to the EEA, circular business models in textiles \u2014 such as leasing, sharing, and take-back and resale \u2014 need to be scaled up with the support of policies addressing materials and design, production and distribution, use and reuse, collection and recycling. This can include policies such as sustainable production and product policies, eco design and durability standards, green public procurement, safe and sustainable materials, waste prevention and extended producer responsibility, and labelling and standards.\n2017\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/private-consumption-textiles-eus-fourth-1 or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 08:17 PM\nFiled under: environmental pressures consumption textiles circular economy\nFiled under: environmental pressures, consumption, textiles, circular economy\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Waste prevention is the best waste management policy option, according to the waste hierarchy, the EU's main rule for the environmental ranking of waste management policies.

of textile waste prevention\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 The EU as a whole and many individual countries have achieved a relative decoupling of waste generation from \neconomic growth. However, there are no signs that the overall objective of reducing waste generation in a growing \neconomy is close to being achieved.\n\n\u2022 Data for trends in waste generation show no observable link between the adoption of waste prevention \nprogrammes by countries in 2013 and the amount of waste generated. In fact, waste generation, excluding major \nmineral wastes, increased by 5.2\u00a0% between 2014 and 2018 in the EU.\n\n\u2022 In mid-2021, 10 out of the 32 countries examined did not have a waste prevention programme in place, although all \nEU Member States had one in place earlier. This might be the result of countries deciding to align waste prevention \npolicies with waste management plans or circular economy strategies, which can unlock synergetic effects.\n\n\u2022 The introduction of solid quantitative prevention targets at the EU level would help consolidate prevention efforts \nin European countries and promote a comprehensive prevention policy, including measures and indicators, driven \nby the objective of fulfilling the target.\n\n\u2022 Textile waste would benefit greatly from waste prevention measures, as this is a fast-growing, environmentally \nimpactful waste stream associated with unsustainable consumption patterns. The average European generates \napproximately 11\u00a0kg of textile waste annually.\n\n\u2022 Preventing textile waste has great potential, mainly through reducing consumption, eco-design and ultimately \nreuse. To facilitate this, emphasis should be put on product design to promote durable and long-lasting materials, \nwhile support should be given to repair (e.g. tax breaks) and reuse (e.g. regulation).\n\f\n\u00a9 Beth Barkway, Environment & Me/EEA\n\f\n9Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nExecutive summary\n\nWaste prevention is the best waste management policy option, \naccording to the waste hierarchy, the EU's main rule for the \nenvironmental ranking of waste management policies. Its main \nobjective is to reduce waste generation, the environmental \nimpacts of waste management and the hazardousness of the \nwaste generated. It is mainly expressed as the aspiration to \nbreak the link between waste generation and economic growth \n(decoupling). To support this objective, the EU and all is Member \nStates have put in place legislation that promotes activities in \nproducts' life cycles aimed at reducing the amount of waste \ngenerated. At the national level, these policies are described \nin national or regional waste prevention programmes, which \nhave been in place in most of the countries examined since at \nleast\u00a02013.\n\nThis report aims to assess progress towards waste prevention \nmeasures' main objective of decoupling, scoping the EU as \na whole by synthesising information from national waste \nprevention measures, targets, indicators and targeted waste \nstreams. Our analysis shows that waste generation at the \nEU level is still very dependent on developments in the \neconomy,\tas\texpressed\tthrough\tgross\tdomestic\tproduct\u00a0(GDP).\t\nThe EU has achieved a relative decoupling, meaning that \nwaste generation is growing, albeit at a slower pace than \nthe economy. However, there are no signs that absolute \ndecoupling, meaning that waste is decreasing in a growing \neconomy, is close to being achieved at the EU level. Moreover, \nthere is no observable effect of the wide adoption by countries \nof waste prevention programmes since at least 2013, as waste \ngeneration, excluding major mineral wastes, has increased by \n5.7\u00a0%\tin\tthe\t4\tyears\tbetween\t2014\tand\t2018.\tAt\tthe\tnational\t\nlevel, changes in population have not been large enough to \nsufficiently explain the changes in waste intensity, defined as \nthe amount of waste generated per unit of GDP. Overall, only \n7 out of 30 countries showed an increase in waste intensity \n(more waste generated per unit GDP) between 2008 and 2018, \nwhile 12 countries showed a strong (more than 10 percentage \npoints)\u00a0decrease.\n\nThe national/regional waste prevention programmes have \nbeen analysed with respect to the waste streams in focus, \nindicators, targets and waste prevention measures. This \nexamination revealed that 10 out of the 32 countries reviewed \ndo not have a waste prevention programme in place (based on \ndata from 2021). To date, only 10 countries have updated their \nwaste prevention programmes according to the revised Waste \nFramework Directive ((EU) 2018/851). Updated programmes \n\nshow a higher tendency to set quantitative targets when there \nwere solely qualitative targets before, indicating a stronger \nmovement towards waste prevention. While informative \nmeasures and awareness-raising are the most used measure \ntypes in Member States, we found that the number of newly \ninitiated voluntary agreements has decreased slightly. Finally, \nwith regard to specific waste streams, measures addressing \nplastic packaging waste, food waste and waste electronic \nproducts in particular have gained in importance.\n\nWith regard to the new focus area of food waste, it has been \nshown that most countries are already active in promoting food \nwaste prevention. The measures implemented, however, have \nbeen evaluated as relatively light and tend to focus on voluntary \ncommitments or information provision. With the food waste \nprevention programmes currently developed across Europe, it \nis expected that food waste prevention policy will be designed \nin a more systematic manner and that more effective measures, \ntargets and data collection systems for food waste will be \nintroduced. Prevention of waste through reuse, which is the \nsecond new focus area, has gained importance for a number \nof product groups. Analysis has, however, revealed divergent \nframeworks depending on product group, with reuse already \nestablished and a central part of the market for certain product \ngroups (e.g. for cars) and still in its infancy for others. However, \nthe recent focus of EU legislation on reuse is expected to \nmotivate EU Member States to intensify their efforts, especially \nwith respect to product groups addressed by that legislation, \nnamely electronics, furniture, construction materials and \nproducts, and textiles.\n\nThe second part of this report examines the potential of waste \nprevention policies to address the growing quantities of textile \nwastes. Textile is a very suitable candidate for such policies, \nas it is a fast-growing waste stream, based on unsustainable \nconsumption patterns, driven by phenomena such as fast \nfashion. This suitability is increasingly being recognised by \nEU policymakers, as the textile industry is a key sector for \napplying circular economy measures, a key part of which is \nwaste\u00a0prevention.\n\nEach\tEuropean\tcitizen\tgenerates\taround\t11\u00a0kg\tof\ttextile\twaste\t\nannually. Of this quantity, around one third is separately \ncollected for reuse and recycling, suggesting that two thirds \nends up in residual waste or is stored in households. Several \ndrivers have been identified for the generation of textile waste, \nincluding the increasing number of clothing collections placed \n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n10 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\non the market by fashion brands, social media advertising fast \nfashion brands and digitalisation, which has helped fashion \nbrands to develop efficient supply chains and gain customers \nthrough online shopping.\n\nThe assessment of the policy background on textile waste \nprevention has highlighted various regulations that are directly \nor indirectly linked to textile waste generation, such as the \nTextile Regulation on textile fibre names and related labelling \nand marking of the fibre composition of textile products \n((EU)\tNo\u00a01007/2011),\tthe\tREACH\t(Registration,\tEvaluation,\t\nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation \n((EC)\u00a0No\u00a01907/2006)\tand\tthe\tEU\tgreen\tpublic\tprocurement\t\ncriteria for textile products and services. At the national level, \nvarious measures have been set out by Member States to \naddress textile waste. While 40 measures have been recorded \nin total across all programmes, some included specific \nsub-chapters dealing with textile waste generation and linked \nenvironmental impacts. Currently, only 6 out of 31 national \nand regional waste prevention programmes include specific \nindicators on textile waste prevention. The majority of these \nindicators focus on the reuse of clothing and footwear. When it \ncomes to targets, it has been shown that none of the currently \navailable waste prevention programmes include quantified \n\ntargets for textile waste prevention. This could be a major \ndrawback in waste prevention efforts, as solid targets are a \ndriver for comprehensive policies.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the intervention points for textile \nwaste prevention throughout products' life cycle stages; this \nhighlights the potential at each stage such as product design, \nproduction and distribution, use and maintenance, and reuse \nto contribute to waste prevention. Various potential measures \nare discussed, such as the extended producer responsibility \nschemes, which can encourage collection for reuse and improve \ndurability. A key barrier to the implementation of textile waste \nprevention measures, targets and indicators continues to be \nthat the actual quantity of textile waste generation remains \nwidely unknown. It is argued that increasing the collection rate \nwill make more textiles available for recycling and potentially \nalso for reuse. Although the textile value chain is highly \nglobalised and complex, closing communication gaps between \nstakeholders, implementing 'design for prevention' and \nincreasing transparency, i.e. traceability, would accelerate textile \nwaste prevention efforts. More specifically, strategies need to \nbe developed to address the increasing consumption of textiles, \nadvance their durability through improved design, and support \nrepair and reuse through economic instruments and regulation.\n\f\n11Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n1\nIntroduction\n\nWaste prevention is a key strategy for Europe's \ntransformation towards a resource-light and climate-neutral \ncircular economy. The long-established waste prevention \nhierarchy, as the optimal policy option for dealing with waste \ngeneration (Figure 1.1), offers the same type of systemic \nand transformational policy objective as the aspiration \nfor a circular economy. Waste prevention, by definition, \nlinks different life cycle stages of products together under \na common principle, namely that of waste reduction. In \nthis way, waste prevention provides a comprehensive \npolicy approach that links together stakeholders in the \nsupply chain, design and use of products and services, and \nwaste\u00a0management.\n\nWhen we look closer at the circular economy objectives of \nreducing the extraction of natural resources and keeping \nthe value of products as high as possible and for as long as \npossible, it is evident that waste prevention clearly contributes \nto this directly. Adopting key waste prevention strategies, such \nas design for durability and longevity, reuse of products and \nmaterials and the extension of product lifespans, ultimately \nleads to using fewer products, and therefore resources, to \nsatisfy our societal needs. Other waste prevention options, \nsuch as repair and remanufacturing, can safeguard the value \nof products and make sure that they are used until the actual \nend of their service life. Waste prevention strategies are \nconceptually summarised in Figure 1.2.\n\nProduct\n(non-waste)\n\nWaste\n\nPrevention\n\nPreparing for re-use\n\nRecycling\n\nRecovery\n\nDisposal\n\nFigure 1.1 The EU waste hierarchy\n\nSource: European Commission (2018).\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n12 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nThe importance of waste prevention, as outlined above, is \nrecognised not only in EU legislation, but also in the 2020 \ncircular economy action plan, which calls for specific waste \nprevention steps to be taken and for the consideration of \ndeveloping waste prevention targets for specific sectors and \nwaste streams.\n\nAccording to the definition set out in the revised Waste \nFramework Directive (WFD), waste prevention refers to:\n\nmeasures taken before a substance, material or product \nhas become waste, that reduce:\n\na. the quantity of waste, including through the reuse of \nproducts or the extension of the lifespan of products;\n\nb. the adverse impacts of the generated waste on the \nenvironment and human health; or\n\nc. the content of hazardous substances in materials and \nproducts. (EU, 2018).\n\nThe overall objective for implementing waste prevention \nis to 'break the link between economic growth and the \nenvironmental impacts associated with the generation of \nwaste' (EU, 2018). In order to implement waste prevention, in \naccordance with Article 29 of the WFD, Member States have \nto establish waste prevention programmes describing specific \nobjectives and measures.\n\nWaste prevention can be applied to separate waste streams (see \nBox 1.1) and the overall policies can be supported by tailor-made \nmeasures that address particular aspects of the waste stream \nin question. Textile waste is a prime candidate stream that \nwould benefit greatly from implementing waste prevention on \n\naccount of the high levels of consumption of textile products \nin Europe and its increasing waste generation. More broadly, \ntextiles is also a very relevant sector for EU policymaking. It has \nbeen recognised as a key sector in the circular economy action \nplan of 2020. Currently, the European Commission is working on \npreparing a textile strategy for the EU. Therefore, the thematic \npart of this report focuses on the prevention of textile waste, \nassessing the potential for prevention in this waste stream and \ngathering knowledge that will be potentially useful for the broad \npolicy processes currently in the making.\n\nThis report has a dual purpose. The first is to provide a \nsnapshot of the current implementation of waste prevention \nmeasures in Europe and assess the progress towards the main \noverall objective of waste prevention of decoupling waste \ngeneration from economic growth. The second aim of the \nreport is to investigate a specific waste stream and assess its \nprospects for implementing waste prevention. Therefore, this \nreport is divided into two parts:\n\n\u2022 Chapter 2 provides an overview of the progress towards \nimplementing waste prevention as a whole.

It is expected that waste from the end-of-life \nstage of such technologies will increase exponentially in the coming years. \n\nWaste prevention can tackle these emerging waste streams by interventions in product design and maintenance (for more \ndetails,\tplease\tconsult\tthe\tEEA\tbriefing\ton\temerging\twaste\tstreams\u00a0(a)) and some European countries are already moving in \nthat direction:\n\n\u2022 In 2020, Enel Green, in Spain, launched a call for start-ups to develop solutions for the life extension, recyclability and \nremanufacturing of wind turbine components.\n\n\u2022 In the wind sector, some producers offer regular maintenance and repair of wind turbines in operation to increase \nthe durability and life span of wind power plants, and others are exploring targets for waste prevention using life \ncycle\u00a0assessment.\n\n\u2022 In Finland, France, Germany and some other European countries, enterprises have come to agreements with electric \ncar manufacturers to use batteries that have been decommissioned but still function in a second-life application as \nresidential battery packs for storing solar energy.\n\nNote: (a) https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emerging-waste-streams-opportunities-and\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emerging-waste-streams-opportunities-and\f\n\u00a9 Ergys Gezka, WasteSMART/EEA\n\f\n15Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2\nMonitoring progress in waste \nprevention implementation\n\n2.1 Decoupling waste generation from \neconomic growth\n\nArticle 30 of the revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) \nmandates the EEA to analyse the 'decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth and the transition towards a \ncircular economy' (EU, 2018). In the past, increases in economic \noutput have been accompanied by simultaneous increases in \nwaste generation, and so sustained economic growth brings a \ncontinual increase in waste generation. The transition towards \na circular economy in Europe, in which the value of products \nand raw materials contained in those are preserved for as \nlong as possible, aims to break this link and minimise overall \nwaste generation. Successful waste prevention aims to increase \nwell-being and reduce waste generation and the corresponding \nenvironmental impacts.\n\nThere are three types of decoupling:\n\n1. absolute decoupling, when waste generation is decreasing, \nwhile the economy is growing;\n\n2. relative decoupling, when waste generation is increasing, \nbut at a slower pace than economic growth;\n\n3. no decoupling, when waste generation is increasing at the \nsame pace as or faster than the economy.\n\nInterpreting these types of decoupling and linking them to \nwaste prevention measures is difficult, as other socio-economic \nfactors also influence the level of waste generated. First of all, \nregarding the influence of economic factors, waste generation \ndepends more on specific expenditure types and the share of \nexpenditure types by income than on broad, economy-wide \neconomic developments, in particular when examining specific \nwaste streams. Other social factors that affect waste generation \nare demography (especially population growth) and household \nsize. Underlying this is the cultural variety of Europe, which \nencompasses a range of lifestyle habits across all areas, \nincluding consumption and waste management.\n\nThis complexity of factors affecting waste generation \nis significant when trying to interpret trends. When it is \nimpossible to establish causal links between waste prevention \nmeasures and waste generation trends, it is difficult to draw \nconclusions on decoupling, as the decoupling stability might be \ncompromised by other socio-economic factors. For example, \nduring the dip in waste generation during the financial crisis of \n2008-2010 did not lead to decoupling because it was a result \nof an economic downturn, not the effect of waste policy making.\n\n2.1.1 EU level\n\nFigure 2.1 shows that waste generation in the EU has been \nincreasing constantly since 2008. Between 2008 and 2018, total \nwaste\tgeneration\tincreased\tby\t8.5\u00a0%\t(more\tthan\t182\u00a0million\u00a0tonnes).\t\nMajor mineral wastes, such as hard rocks, concrete and soils, \ncomprise a major share of total waste. However, this type of waste \nis produced in specific economic sectors (construction and mining) \nand the management of this type of waste poses a relatively \nlow environmental concern compared with other waste types. \nTherefore, to be able to interpret trends in a more meaningful \nway, Figure 2.1 includes a trend for waste excluding major mineral \nwastes.\tThis\tshows\ta\tlower\tincrease\tof\t6.4\u00a0%\tover\tthe\tsame\tperiod.\t\nFor both waste generation types, there is a sharper increase in the \nlast data point (2018). However, it should be noted that measuring \ntotal waste is a complex task, with data collection and data quality \nissues encountered.\n\nGenerally, a population increase could, of course, explain an \nincrease in absolute amounts of waste generated. However, \nthe EU-27 population was relatively stable between 2008 and \n2018, so the reasons for the increase in waste generation \ncannot be attributed to demography. The EU's gross domestic \nproduct (GDP)\u00a0(1) in the same period of time increased by \n20.4\u00a0%,\tat\ta\tmuch\tfaster\tpace\tthan\tthe\twaste\tgenerated.\tThis\t\nmeans that the EU as a whole has achieved relative decoupling, \nbut has not yet achieved waste prevention measures' main \nobjective of actually reducing the waste generated while the \neconomy\u00a0grows.\n\n(1) GDP here includes the contribution of mining and also demolition that result in the waste excluded from the graph in Figure 2.1. Although this \nlimitation is acknowledged, the contribution to GDP from these activities is very small.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n16 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBy 2013, most EU Member States put in place their waste \nprevention programmes in line with the mandate from the 2008 \nWFD. Looking at the waste generation trends in Figure 2.1, there \nis no observable impact of the adoption of the programmes \nat EU level. In fact, waste generation, excluding major mineral \nwastes,\tincreased\tby\t5.2\u00a0%\tbetween\t2014\tand\t2018.\n\nWaste intensity expresses waste generation per unit of GDP, \nreflecting the economy's 'eco-efficiency' in terms of the \nlevels of waste generated (Eurostat, 2020a). This term and \nsubsequent indicator is part of Eurostat's circular economy \nmonitoring framework. Waste intensity also reflects the \nstructure of the economy, as a services-based economy \nis less waste intensive than an industry-based economy. \nHowever, given that the structure of the economy changes \nat a relatively slow rate, changes in waste intensity are likely \nto indicate trends towards decoupling. For the EU-27, the \nwaste intensity (for total waste, excluding major mineral \nwaste), decreased from approximately 68\u00a0kg/EUR\u00a01\u00a0000\tGDP\t\nin\t2008\tto\taround\u00a060\u00a0kg/EUR\u00a01\u00a0000\tGDP\tin\t2018,\twhich\tis\t\na significant improvement, in spite of the EU not achieving \n\nFigure 2.1 Waste generation development compared with gross domestic product (GDP) and population in \nthe EU-27\n\nPercentage\n\n0\n\n2008 20102009 20142012 2016 2018\n\n125\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n2011 2013 2015 2017\n\nTotal waste generation\n\nGross Domestic Product\n(GDP)\n\nPopulation\n\nTotal waste excluding\nmajor mineral wastes\n\nabsolute decoupling. The 2016-2018 change led to the largest \ndrop in waste intensity, because although waste generation \nincreased at a faster pace than before, the acceleration of the \neconomy was even faster. This demonstrates the usefulness \nof waste intensity as a metric for monitoring progress towards \ndecoupling waste generation from economic growth.\n\nThese changes in waste intensity are the combined effect \nof various developments that either increase or decrease \nwaste generation, specifically continuous economic growth \n(a key driver of waste generation) and at the same time the \nimproved efficiency of production processes (as highlighted \nby\tEurostat\tindicators\ton\tresource\tproductivity)\u00a0(2). It is not \npossible, however, to quantify the effect of waste prevention \nmeasures that have been implemented by the EU countries \nduring this period, as the effect of prevention measures can \nrarely be assessed quantitatively and unilaterally against \nwaste generation. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the \npossibility that the emphasis given to waste prevention in the \n2008 WFD may have resulted in, for example, improvements in \nwaste intensity.\n\n(2) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Resource_productivity_statistics\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Resource_productivity_statistics\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n17Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTo highlight the relevance of these contributing factors, a \ndecomposition analysis was conducted to assess the effect \nof certain driving forces on waste generation (Hoekstra and \nvan der Bergh, 2006), decomposing the change in a macro \nindicator (waste generation) between two points in time into \nthe contributions from the changes in the determinants (in this \ncase, economic growth and waste intensity).\n\nFigure 2.2 shows the result of this analysis: the change in waste \ngenerated per capita over time (taking 2008 as the reference \nyear) is depicted as the combined effect of increased GDP and \ndecreased waste intensity. An increase in GDP alone would lead \nto an increase in waste generation and a decrease in waste \nintensity would lead to a decrease in waste generation. The figure \nshows the net effect of these two developments combined.\n\nThe orange line indicates that waste generation per capita \ndecreased slightly in 2010 and 2012, mainly because of \nthe economic crisis; Between 2010 and 2012 the effect \nof the increase in GDP on economic growth (in blue) was \novercompensated for by decreased waste intensity (grey bars). \nThe struggling economy grew so slowly that technological and \norganisational improvements were able to reduce the total \ngeneration of waste in Europe. Since 2014 the relation between \nthe two effects has been reversed, leading to a significant \nincrease in waste generation per capita of almost 100\u00a0kg. \n\nThe pace of economic growth based on increasing turnover \nin industry and increased consumption expenditure by \nhouseholds has outrun efforts to reduce waste generation per \neuro of value created.\n\nThe analysis highlights that an actual and significant decoupling \nof waste generation and economic growth has not been \nachieved over the last decade. The total generation of waste is \nstill closely linked to GDP growth rates. The analysis of waste \nprevention programmes and other activities aimed at avoiding \nwaste generation (see following sections in this chapter) has \nshown a slight increase in the stringency of such measures \n(e.g. showing a higher share of regulatory measures compared \nwith\tjust\tinformative\tmeasures,\tsuch\tas\tawareness\u00a0raising\t\ncampaigns); nevertheless, this is not yet reflected in the \nactual outcomes that still indicate rather linear patterns of \nproduction and consumption. A more detailed analysis of the \navailable data shows a very close relation between decreasing \nwaste intensities and a rising share of the service sector in the \nEU-27. New business models based on 'pay per use' seem to \ncontribute to waste prevention, but of course the rising share \nof\tthe\ttertiary\tsector\t\u2014\tfrom\t33.9\u00a0%\tto\t39\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU-27\tGDP\t\nbetween 2008 and 2018 \u2014 also reduced the share of especially \nwaste-intensive production processes in Europe. Further \nanalysis should focus on the extent to which such processes \nhave just been outsourced to other regions.\n\nFigure 2.2 Decomposition analysis of waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes)\n\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n-14\n\nPercentage\n\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\nWaste generation, excluding major mineral wasteWaste intensityGross Domestic Product (GDP)\n\n-0.32-0.24\n1.12\n\n3.18\n\n6.90\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n18 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.1.2 Country level\n\nMap 2.1 illustrates the evolution of waste intensity as the \ngeneration of waste (excluding major mineral waste) per unit \nGDP from 2008 to 2018. Positive values in Map 2.1 indicate that \nthe increase of waste generation has exceeded the economic \ngrowth (in terms of GDP) within that period, whereas negative \nvalues indicate a successful relative or absolute decoupling of \nwaste generation from economic growth. Map 2.1 also shows the \npopulation change in the same period (2008-2018) and the level \nof waste generation in 2018. In most cases, the population change \n\nis not large enough to explain sufficiently the changes in the \nwaste intensity. In some countries with positive developments in \nwaste intensity (negative values in Map 2.1), population increased, \nsuch is the case in Austria, Finland, Iceland, Turkey and Sweden. \nIn countries that were also successful in decoupling the waste \ngeneration from economic growth, such as Romania, Lithuania \nand Hungary, the population did decrease, but this alone cannot \njustify the changes in waste intensity. On the other hand, Latvia is \nthe only country where the population decrease was higher than \nthe reduction in waste intensity, meaning that the improvement in \nLatvia can be explained by the population change.

Ireland shows the highest \nincrease in waste intensity, meaning that its waste generation far \nexceeded economic growth, while the opposite is the case for \nRomania. To account for factors influencing waste intensity, other \nthan waste prevention measures, a deeper investigation of the \neconomic structure of the countries would be needed, but that \nexercise is outside the scope of this report. Note that changes \nin data collection systems, data quality, waste classification and \ndefinitions might have played a role in the data in Map 2.1.\n\nDespite the acknowledged complexity of assessing waste \ngeneration trends against economic developments, the \nmain objective of the EU waste prevention policy, namely \nthe absolute decoupling of waste generation from economic \ngrowth, has not been achieved yet. However, the fact that many \nEU Member States, and the EU as a whole, show a relative \ndecoupling during the period 2008-2018 is an encouraging sign \nfor future developments.\n\n2.2 Overview of national and regional waste \nprevention programmes\n\nThe WFD required that Member States established waste \nprevention programmes no later than December 2013. The \nwaste prevention programmes have been operating since then. \nThe following Table 2.1 provides an overview of the current \nstatus and duration of the different regional and national waste \nprevention programmes. Based on the provisions in the WFD, \nsome were developed as stand-alone programmes, whereas in \nsome other countries the programmes have been included in \nwaste management plans or strategies.\n\nIt can be observed that there is an increasing trend for countries \nto integrate waste prevention programmes in national waste \nmanagement plans or other policy documents, such as their \ncircular economy laws or strategies, as is the case in France, for \nexample. One reason for this trend is that such an integration \nwith waste management plans aligns the implementation \nperiod of a country's main strategic waste policy documents. \nThis, however, might lead to gaps if a country is not covered by \na waste prevention programme for a certain period.\n\nTable 2.1 shows that 10 out of the 32 countries are not covered \nby a waste prevention programme in 2021. According to the \nWFD, waste prevention programmes have to be evaluated and \nrevised at least every 6 years and, where relevant, in the event \n\nof a legislative change in the WFD (see Article 30(1)). Given that \nall Member States had to have their first waste prevention \nprogrammes published in 2013, various Member States had \nplanned to have a new waste prevention programme in place \nin 2019, 6 years after their first one. However, the amendment \nof the WFD in 2018 introduced a new approach to waste \nprevention and new requirements for EU Member States. \nTherefore, a number of EU countries are in the process of \nreconsidering their national waste strategies, including waste \nprevention. This report takes into account newly ratified waste \nprevention programmes where available, but it should also be \nacknowledged that the effect of the amended WFD is not yet \nreflected in all countries' waste prevention programmes.\n\nReflecting on the impact of adopting waste prevention \nprogrammes on waste generation, no observable trends can \nbe seen. Figure 2.1 shows that waste generation has been \nunaffected by the wide adoption of such programmes by \nEuropean countries in 2013. Moreover, looking at individual \ncountries in the EEA waste prevention country profiles\u00a0(3), \nthe adoption of a waste prevention programme is very rarely \ncorrelated with a drop in waste generation afterwards.\n\nBox 2.1 Example of the evaluation process \nin\u00a0Germany\n\nThe German federal government adopted its first \nwaste prevention programme in July 2013 under the \ntitle 'Waste prevention programme of the German \ngovernment with the involvement of the federal states' \n('Abfallvermeidungsprogramm des Bundes unter Beteiligung \nder L\u00e4nder'). The German waste prevention programme is \nto be evaluated every 6 years and updated as necessary \nas per Section 33 of Germany's waste prevention \nmechanism, the Circular Economy Act (KrWG). Against \nthis background, the German environmental protection \nagency (Umweltbundesamt) initiated a research project to \nevaluate the status quo of waste prevention in Germany. \nThis included an assessment of waste prevention results \nand the institutional structures. Other aspects not \npreviously addressed in the waste prevention programme \nwere also to be examined to see whether or not they \ncontribute to waste prevention. Specific proposals to \npossibly develop and update the programme were \ndeveloped based on the results of the analysis referring \nto the current status of the implementation of the waste \nprevention programme at the federal, state and municipal \nlevels and the evaluation of existing prevention potentials. \nConcrete proposals for measures concerning previously \nprioritised waste streams and relevant priority prevention \napproaches were developed to facilitate this.\n\nSources: UBA (2020).\n\n(3) https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries/norway-waste-prevention-fact-sheet/view\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n20 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nThe analysis presented in this report is based on the national \nwaste prevention programmes presented in Table 2.1.

Additionally, there is a \nspecial focus on the prevention of food waste.\n\nThe national waste prevention programmes include measures \nand targets for the specific waste streams in focus accordingly. \nEach country's selection of waste stream, however, is also \nrelated to factors such as waste volumes generated or economic \nimportance (EEA, 2021), which may differ in different national \nsettings. An overview of the waste streams considered in the \nnational waste prevention programmes is outlined in Table 2.2.\n\nTable 2.2 Waste streams considered in EEA member countries and regions\n\nEEA member \ncountries\n\nFood/\norganic \nwaste (30)\n\nPlastic/\npackaging \nwaste (30)\n\nTextile (16) Manufacturing \nwaste (29) WEEE (29)\n\nHousehold/\nmunicipal \nwaste (28)\n\nHazardous \nwaste (27)\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\u00a0(a)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nNote: (a) Note that the regional plan, as part of the Wallonia regional programme, does not cover textile and manufacturing waste.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n22 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBased on this overview, it can be stated that most countries \nhave almost all types of waste materials covered:\n\n\u2022 Hazardous waste, which is considered in almost all \ncountries, is often addressed in specific strategies, e.g. in \nthe Irish national hazardous waste management plan.\n\n\u2022 Plastic, i.e. packaging waste, and food waste are focus \npoints in all programmes that are covered by various types \nof measures.\n\n\u2022 Textile waste, which has gained in importance as a waste \nstream, is considered in 16 programmes. Countries such \nas Belgium, Germany and Slovakia have included textile \nwaste in their revised waste prevention programmes, \nwhereas there had been no consideration of textile waste \nin their former programmes.\n\nWith respect to the recommendations of the revised WFD, \ncountries already seem to have been considering WEEE, \npackaging, manufacturing and hazardous waste. Furniture is \nnot yet broadly addressed as a standalone waste stream, but \nin some cases it is included in household waste prevention \nmeasures. Textile waste is not yet a focus in most countries, \nbut the recent policy focus at the EU level (e.g. the forthcoming \ntextile strategy) is expected to make textiles more prominently \npart of the next versions of waste prevention programmes.\n\nOverall, it can be seen that the revision of waste prevention \nprogrammes is accompanied by an extension of the waste \nstreams considered. Slovakia, for instance, includes the waste \nstreams textiles and WEEE, which are additions in comparison \nto its former programme.\n\nThis overview also serves as a reflection of the countries' policy \npriorities. The fact that plastic and food waste are considered \nthroughout all programmes can, for instance, be traced \nback to policy initiatives at the EU level; waste prevention \nprogrammes serve as a policy vehicle to address certain \nrequirements. These two streams have long been recognised \nas having a significant potential for prevention, while the \nprevention of food waste is specifically included in the UN \nSustainable Development Goals.\n\n2.4 Indicators\n\nThe application of indicators is crucial to monitoring and \nassessing the waste prevention measures set in place. \nGiven that the amendments in the WFD reorient the policy \nfocus from the development of prevention strategies and \nprogrammes towards the implementation of prevention and \nits monitoring, indicators become essential elements for future \nprevention policies. Indicators ensure not only the monitoring \nof developments but also the evaluation of their effectiveness.\n\nThe waste Prevention indicators can thereby be manyfold, \ncategorised into four types: (1) output-based indicators, \n(2)\u00a0decoupling\tindicators,\t(3)\tresponse\tindicators\tand\t(4)\t\nindicators of specific waste prevention measures. While \noutput-based indicators monitor the success of waste \nprevention measures in absolute numbers or percentages, \ndecoupling indicators consider them in relation to economic \nvalues such as GDP. Response indicators relate to the process \nof waste prevention (such as number of measures) and, finally, \nindicators are grouped into specific waste prevention measures \nthat do not relate to the aggregated effects of the programme \nbut to specific prevention measures (such as cost-benefit). An \noverview of indicator types considered in the waste prevention \nprogrammes of the countries examined is provided in Table 2.3.\n\nIt can be seen that output-based indicators are covered in \nmost of the programmes. These mostly refer to the generation \nof total or specific waste streams or to material flows such as \nhousehold or municipal waste or construction and demolition \nwaste (tonnes/year). Reuse rates are also considered; for \nexample, Poland considers the percentage of packaging placed \non the market that is reusable.\n\nDecoupling indicators, which illustrate a nation's waste \nintensity or the waste intensity of a specific sector, are \nimplemented in 11 out of 30 programmes. They are commonly \nexpressed per unit of GDP (and per population) or gross value \nadded (GVA). An example is Slovakia, where the indicator \nquantity of total municipal waste per unit of GDP and \npopulation is used.\n\nResponse indicators can cover a wide range of indicators. \nDenmark, for example, considers the number of enterprises \nwith certified environmental management, the number of \neco-labelled products and the degree of public awareness of \nthem. Italy uses response indicators throughout various waste \nstreams, such as the number of guidelines related to food \nindustry by-products or the number of ethical procurement \ngroups created.\n\nIndicators linked to specific waste prevention measures \n(e.g.\u00a0banning\tspecific\tsingle-use\tplastic\tproducts)\tare\tincluded\t\nin nine programmes. Ireland, for instance, considers the money \nsaved by comparing the costs of waste before and after the \nintervention. The region Flanders, on the other hand, considers \nthe amount and cost of littering and illegal dumping and the \nnumber of rubbish bins.\n\nOverall, it can be stated that indicators are relatively sparsely \nused throughout the countries, with output-based indicators \nbeing the most common type of indicator used. While some \nprogrammes involve indicators that cover up to three types of \nindicator, other programmes have not included any indicator. \nThis can be the case for countries that predominantly define \nqualitative waste prevention targets, e.g. Norway.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n23Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTable 2.3 Waste prevention indicators considered in EEA countries and regions\n\nEEA member \ncountries\n\nOutput-based \nindicators (22)\n\nDecoupling \nindicators\u00a0(11)\n\nResponse \nindicators\u00a0(18)\n\nSpecific waste prevention \nindicators (9)\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\u00a0(a)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nNote: The\tprogramme\tfor\tthe\tBrussels\tregion\tcontains\tno\tindicators,\twhile\tthe\tFlemish\tone\tincludes\tonly\tspecific\tindicators.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n24 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.5 Targets\n\nTarget setting is the cornerstone of policymaking in the area \nof waste prevention. Targets set the stage and calibrate the \nambition of the overall waste prevention strategy and for \nspecific waste streams if needed. Targets can drive the policy \nprocess, as they require:\n\n\u2022 developing indicators for monitoring progress towards \nthe\u00a0target;\n\n\u2022 indicating data requirements to measure progress;\n\n\u2022 designing measures that would bring about the change \ncommanded by the target; \n\n\u2022 evaluating the effectiveness of the entire waste prevention \nprogramme at the end of its implementation.\n\nThe type of targets defined in the waste prevention \nprogrammes can be qualitative or quantitative. An overview of \ntarget types set throughout the Member States is outlined in \nTable 2.4.\n\nA quantitative target is usually concrete and measurable. \nThat is why it serves as a strong driver for waste prevention \nimplementation. A successful implementation is, however, \ndependent on the availability of timely and robust data sets, \nwhich can be a limitation. Quantitative targets are included in \n22 out of the 30 programmes reviewed. However, they mostly \nrefer to one or two waste streams that are in focus in that \ncountry. Croatia and Estonia, for instance, have one central \ntarget on municipal waste prevention, whereas Austria's and \nFinland's quantitative target is to halve food waste by 2030.\n\nWhen carefully planned, qualitative targets can provide \nevidence of successful actions. A few countries (e.g. Austria, \nIceland, Norway and Slovenia) have identified qualitative targets \nonly, while in most countries qualitative and quantitative \ntargets exist. The qualitative targets defined within the waste \nprevention programmes are manifold but mainly refer to \ncentral waste streams (e.g. electronics, construction, municipal \nwaste and hazardous waste). Slovenia and Iceland, for instance, \nhave several measures in place that focus explicitly on \nhazardous waste prevention.\n\nAn ideal situation for national programmes is to use both types \nof targets in a blended approach. This is being done by a lot of \ncountries. Particularly with regard to the updated programmes, \nthe tendency is that quantitative targets have been put in place \n\nwhere solely qualitative targets were considered before. This \nhas been the case in Germany and Slovakia, and although \nCyprus did not have any defined targets, the new programme \nincludes both qualitative and quantitative targets. This \ndevelopment indicates countries making stronger commitments \nto waste prevention and is expected to bear measurable results \nin the coming years.\n\nThis leaves only two countries with no waste prevention \ntargets: Hungary and Switzerland. Following the trend of \nother countries, however, targets might be set with their \nupdated\u00a0programmes.\n\nThe introduction of common waste prevention targets at the EU \nlevel would help harmonise efforts in countries and promote \nthe development of solid policies around them. The efforts to \nachieve the targets would lead to measure being developed \nto support this, determine the waste streams to focus on and \nimprove the monitoring of progress towards the set targets.\n\nBox 2.2 Quantitative waste prevention targets in \nFrance\n\nIn 2020, France introduced a law on the circular \neconomy and the fight against waste. This legislation \nintroduces a large number of quantitative targets \ncovering overall waste generation and also particular \nwaste streams, such as plastic and food waste. These \nlegally binding targets include:\n\n\u2022 reducing\thousehold\twaste\tby\t15\u00a0%;\n\n\u2022 reducing the quantities of non-hazardous waste \nadmitted\tto\tstorage\tfacilities\tby\t30\u00a0%\tin\t2020,\t\nrelative\tto\t2010,\tand\tby\t50\u00a0%\tin\t2025;\n\n\u2022 recycling\t100\u00a0%\tof\tplastic\tby\t2025,\tdriven\tand\t\nensured by the national waste prevention and \nmanagement policy through measures such as \nimproved\twaste\tcollection\u00a0programmes;\n\n\u2022 reducing the number of single-use plastic beverage \nbottles\tplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\tby\t50\u00a0%\tby\t2030\t\n(Article 66);\n\n\u2022 halving food waste in distribution and collective \ncatering by 2025 and food waste in consumption, \nproduction, processing and commercial catering by \n2030, relative to 2015 (Article 11).\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n25Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTable 2.4 Waste prevention targets considered in EEA countries and regions\n\nEEA member countries Quantitative targets (22) Qualitative targets (23) No targets (2)\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\u00a0(a)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nNote: The Brussels regional programme does not have quantitative targets.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n26 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.6 Waste prevention measures\n\nThe WFD obliges the Member States to indicate specific \nmeasures by which the amount of waste and related \nenvironmental impacts are to be reduced.\n\nThe analysis of the national and regional waste prevention \nprogrammes highlights the broad range of measures already \ntaken or under development in Europe. A total of 327 specific \nmeasures have been recorded, which cover measures initiated \nor undertaken by public authorities only \u2014 most countries and \nregions focus on similar sets of measures. This figure does not \ninclude the probably far bigger number of private initiatives by \nhouseholds or companies, e.g. professional online platforms \nthat offer second-hand products.\n\nIt is important to note that this chapter considers national \ninitiatives. However, countries have the opportunity to \ncollaborate on or exchange best practices regarding waste \nprevention measures in international settings. At the EU \nlevel, a good example of a platform for such exchanges is the \nEuropean\tWeek\tfor\tWaste\tReduction\u00a0(4), during which more \nthan\t10\u00a0000\twaste\tprevention\tactions\twere\tlogged\tin\t2020\t\nfrom 33 European countries. Other collaborative opportunities \nare offered through country networks such as the European \nCommission's waste working group and the EEA's Eionet. Good \npractice examples are systematically registered in the EEA's \ncountry\tprofiles\u00a0(5) for inspiration and, specifically for food \nwaste prevention, at the newly launched EU Food Loss and \nWaste\tPrevention\tHub\u00a0(6).\n\n2.6.1 Share of policy instruments\n\nThe waste prevention programmes cover a variety of policy \ninstruments that can be grouped into the following four main \ntypes: (1) voluntary agreements, (2) regulatory instruments, \n(3)\u00a0economic\tinstruments\tand\t(4)\tinformation\tinstruments.\n\n1. Voluntary agreements refer to agreements among various \nstakeholders. They do not necessarily require a political \ndecision-making process but rather require negotiations. \nIn 2016, for instance, the Italian National Agency for \nNew Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic \n\nDevelopment (ENEA) launched a Symbiosis Users Network \nto enable industrial symbiosis in Italy. The network focuses \non operational symbiosis issues to prevent waste and \npromote circular economy models.\n\n2. Most waste prevention programmes include some \nregulatory instruments. Romania, for instance, launched \na ban on landfilling food waste from wholesale, retail and \ndistribution sectors from January 2023 onwards \u2014 forcing \nthese stakeholders to explore prevention potentials more \nthoroughly. By contrast, in Austria single-use plastic bags \nhave been banned since January 2020, following the rapid \nimplementation of the EU Single-use Plastics Directive.\n\n3. Economic instruments aim to set economic incentives for \nchanges in consumption or production patterns by making \nless waste-intensive alternatives more attractive. This type \nof instrument involves tax regulations (e.g. Bulgaria and \nSweden),\tthe\tintroduction\tof\tfees\tfor\tplastic\tbags\t(e.g.\u00a0most\t\nEU Member States) and other waste management \noperations so that 'waste-light' products or services become \nmore competitive. The financial support for specific waste \nprevention measures can be counted as an economic \ninstrument as well as an economic incentive for making \nsustainable purchases (e.g. Portugal).\n\n4. Information instruments relate to campaigns for \nconsumers or businesses. Romania, for instance, conducts \nawareness-raising campaigns on composting, the reduction \nof food waste and responsible paper consumption. \nThe Netherlands, on the other hand, states that it will \nimplement an eco-design knowledge platform enabling \nbusinesses to access knowledge on a permanent basis. The \nunderlying assumption is that better access to information \nwill change consumer habits or nudge companies towards \ntaking up cost-saving opportunities.\n\nFigure 2.3 illustrates that more than half of the measures \nincluded in countries' waste prevention programmes focus \non the provision of information and awareness-raising. Of the \nmeasures\tlisted\tin\tthe\twaste\tprevention\tprogrammes,\t6\u00a0%\tcan\t\nbe\tclassified\tas\tregulatory\tinstruments\tand\t18\u00a0%\tas\teconomic\t\nor market-based instruments. Voluntary agreements represent \n22\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tmeasures.\n\n(4) https://ewwr.eu\n(5) https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries\n(6) https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu-food-loss-waste-prevention-hub\n\nhttps://ewwr.eu\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n27Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nLooking at the intervention points of the waste prevention \nmeasures, production- or consumption-focused policy \ninstruments can be distinguished, such as the ban of hazardous \nsubstances as an example of measures in the production phase \nor the introduction of levies for plastic bags that primarily \naddress consumers.\n\nBased on the analysis of the prevention programmes for this \nreport,\t52\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tmeasures\taddress\tthe\tproduction\tphase,\t\nincluding\ttheir\tdesign,\tand\t48\u00a0%\taddress\tthe\tconsumption\t\nphase of product life cycles. A relevant number also refers to \nthe waste management sector aiming to set indirect incentives, \nfor instance by increasing landfill taxes for municipal solid \nwaste (here counted as measures that primarily address \nconsumption\u00a0patterns).\n\nIt is important to note that there are rare examples when a \nsingle measure of a specific type has resulted in effective waste \nprevention (e.g. the fees on plastic carrier bags). Usually, it \nis a combination of different types of measures that is most \neffective for implementing prevention measures. Therefore, it \nwould be useful for countries to diversify their waste prevention \nmeasures portfolio and link that to concrete prevention targets.\n\nOn the other hand, this complexity and overlapping of \nmeasures targeting waste prevention makes it difficult to assess \nindividual measures' effectiveness. Some countries make use \nof various proxy indicators to assess effectiveness (e.g. number \nof awareness-raising events taking place), but only in very rare \ncases is it possible to measure the effect on waste generation \n(e.g. levy on plastic carrier bags). For more details on evaluation, \nsee the EEA guideline on evaluating waste prevention \nprogrammes (EEA, 2021).\n\nInterestingly, only a very few waste prevention programmes \ninclude specific measures aimed at cross-country cooperation \non waste prevention, e.g. the Nordic Swan ecolabel, aimed at, \namong other things, waste-light products.\n\n2.6.1 Trends in policy approaches\n\nComparing the mapping above with the EEA's waste prevention \nreport, published in 2016, which gave the first general \noverview on implementation approaches for waste prevention \nprogrammes (EEA, 2016), some trends can be highlighted. The \nshare of information-based instruments that completely depend \non\tvoluntary\tactions\tby\tall\tstakeholders\thas\tdecreased\t(-12\u00a0%),\t\nwhile the share of more stringent measures has increased \n(+10\u00a0%),\tincluding\tboth\teconomic\tand\tregulatory\tinstruments.\n\nIt thes mainly plastic and packaging waste that has been \naddressed by such binding instruments. It seems that \nthe intensive policy discourse and the high level of public \nawareness of the global problems \u2014caused especially by \nplastic waste leaked into marine ecosystems \u2014 have led to the \nperception that voluntary actions alone will not be sufficient. A \nlarge share of these measures also refers to the EU Single-use \nPlastic Directive, which, inter alia, banned plastic straws and \nintroduced levies on plastic bags (see EEA, 2019). A second \nwaste stream that is increasingly addressed by market-based \nor regulatory instruments is food losses. Many countries have \nadopted national commitments to Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 12.3, which demands halving of food losses by 2030.\n\nAt the same time, the number of newly initiated voluntary \nagreements has decreased slightly. It should be noted that this \ndoes not necessarily indicate an overall decrease in this policy \ninstrument's relevance; many voluntary agreements are still in \nplace and have proven to be effective, such as the Green Deals \nin the Netherlands (Green Deal, undated).\n\nThe total number of measures and their relative shares give only \na first indication of the level of ambition, i.e. the relevance of \nspecific policy instruments; the numbers, of course, cannot reflect \nthe impact of a single measure that might differ significantly, \nfor example between a regional awareness campaign and a \ncomprehensive green public procurement programme.\n\nWith regard to specific waste streams addressed by public \nwaste prevention measures, it can be observed that plastic \npackaging waste, food waste and WEEE have especially gained \nin importance. Qualitative prevention, defined as actions \naimed at the phasing out of hazardous substances, is still of \nlimited relevance. None of the waste prevention programmes \ninclude quantified objectives on qualitative waste prevention, \nmethodological approaches and databases that would allow \nmonitoring of progress in this area.\n\nFigure 2.3 Share of policy instruments\n\nInformative\n54 %\n\nVoluntary \nagreements\n\n22 %\n\nMarket-based\n18 %\n\nRegulatory\n6 %\n\nNotes: (a) Note that some countries are in the process of revising \ntheir\twaste\tprevention\tpolicies,\tso\tthis\tfigure\tis\tbased\ton\t\ncontinuously evolving information.\n\nSource: Own calculation based on the EEA country fact sheets on \nwaste\tprevention\u00a0(a).\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries/belgium/view\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n28 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.7 New waste prevention focus areas\n\nThe 2018 amendment of the WFD included new focus areas \nfor waste prevention, with policy initiatives and data collection \nrequirements envisaged at the EU level. These two main focus \nareas are food waste prevention and the promotion of reuse. \nNote that, according to the WFD, the EU Member States have \nto develop separate, although not necessarily standalone, food \nwaste prevention programmes. The information presented \nbelow is derived exclusively from such programmes.\n\n2.7.1 Food waste\n\nApproximately\t20\u00a0%\t(88\tmillion\ttonnes)\u00a0(7) of all produced \nfood within the EU is wasted along the supply chain every \nyear (Stenmarck et al., 2016). Consequently, food waste \nprevention has become one of the key priorities in most \nwaste\u00a0prevention\u00a0programmes.\n\nReducing food waste has enormous potential for reducing the \nresources we use and the pollutants we emit to produce the \nfood we eat. Acting more efficiently will increase the amount of \nfood available for human consumption, save money and lower \nthe wide-ranging environmental impacts of food production \nand\tconsumption\u00a0(8). The EU and the individual countries aspire \nto\tachieving\tthe\ttarget\tin\tSDG\u00a012.3\tto\thalve\tfood\twaste\tper\t\ncapita at the retail and consumer level by 2030 and to reduce \nfood losses along the food production and supply chains. The \nEU\tPlatform\ton\tFood\tLosses\tand\tFood\tWaste\u00a0(9), established \nin 2016, which stimulates stakeholder engagement and \nknowledge exchange, supports this process.\n\nAs called for by the new farm to fork strategy, the Commission \nwill seek to step up action to prevent food loss and waste across \nthe EU. The strategy, part of the European Green Deal, puts \nforward a series of actions to accelerate the transition towards \na sustainable EU food system that safeguards food security \nand ensures access to healthy diets sourced from a healthy \nplanet. Reducing food loss and waste is an integral part of the \nstrategy's action plan, which proposes to establish EU-wide food \nwaste reduction targets by 2023 and revise EU date marking \nrules to prevent food waste linked to the misunderstanding \nand/or misuse of these dates (by end 2022).\n\nThe recently published EEA report on bio-waste emphasised \nonce\tmore\tthe\trole\tof\tfood\twaste\tby\tindicating\tthat\t60\u00a0%\t\nof bio-waste is food waste, of which a considerable share is \navoidable (EEA, 2020). However, a reliable data baseline for \nquantifying the exact amount of food waste, i.e. for monitoring \nthe progress on prevention, still needs to be established.\n\nMeasures on food waste prevention are included in 28 of \nthe 32 national and regional waste prevention programmes. \nThe countries and regions have introduced an array of \npolicies and measures, including:\n\n\u2022 prioritisation of actions against food waste, for better \nefficiency throughout the whole food chain (e.g. Austria, \nFrance, Netherlands, Spain);\n\n\u2022 integration of the waste prevention hierarchy in their \nmanagement plans or other legislation (e.g. Czechia, \nFrance, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia);\n\n\u2022 dealing with surplus food across the food supply chain, \nincluding through the creation of digital redistribution \nplatforms (e.g. Croatia, Denmark,  \nFinland, Netherlands);\n\n\u2022 legislation that obliges supermarkets to donate \nunsaleable but edible food to social institutions or \nto use it alternatively as animal feed or as compost \n(e.g.\u00a0France,\u00a0Italy);\n\n\u2022 donation of pre-packaged food labelled 'Best before ...' \nwithin the timeframe set in the recommendations  \n(e.g. Lithuania);\n\n\u2022 encouragement of food donations by fiscal incentives \nthrough tax credits and tax deductions (e.g. France, \nPortugal, Spain);\n\n\u2022 voluntary agreements in the food sector with the aim \nof reducing food waste (e.g. Spain under the slogan \n'Food\u00a0has\tno\twaste\t\u2014\tUse\tit');\n\n\u2022 obligation to register as a food business operator for all \ncharity organisations (that handle the food), including \nfulfilling requirements for liability, traceability and \nhygiene (e.g. Lithuania, Romania);\n\n\u2022 guidelines for the prevention of food waste in the \ncatering sector (e.g. Germany, Spain);\n\n\u2022 implementation of action plans to reduce food waste \n(e.g. Austria, Sweden);\n\n\u2022 provision of funds for research and innovation activities \nthat help reduce food waste (e.g. Germany);\n\n\u2022 educational activities in schools and/or professional \ntraining (e.g. Croatia, Czechia, Finland, Hungary, Italy);\n\n(7) This excludes food by-products used as animal feed.\n(8) https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu_actions_en\n(9) https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food-waste/eu-actions-against-food-waste/eu-platform-food-losses-and-food-waste_en \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu_actions_en\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n29Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n\u2022 awareness-raising and behaviour change campaigns \nfor consumers (e.g. Germany's 'Too good for the bin!'; \nLatvia's 'Discarded is not gone'; Lithuania's 'Sincerely, \nfood'; Spain's 'More food, less waste'), including dedicated \nevents\t(e.g.\u00a0Danish\t'National\tFood\tWaste\tDay',\tGermany's\t\n'Germany saves food!' awareness-raising week, the \nNetherlands' 'Waste-free Week');\n\n\u2022 creation\tof\tcertification\tschemes\tand\tlabels\t(e.g.\u00a0France's\t\n'anti-food waste label', Luxembourg's 'Antigaspi' \nlogo, Portugal's label for 'sustainable production and \nresponsible\u00a0consumption').\n\nsurplus product channels, intelligent packaging or mandatory \noffering of flexible portion sizes. Small portions for children and \nolder people in restaurants.\n\nOn the other hand, countries have not yet dealt with food waste \nin a separate and comprehensive manner. The food waste \nprevention programmes, currently being developed across \nEurope, are expected to design food waste prevention policy \nin a more systematic manner and introduce more effective \nmeasures, targets and data collection systems for food waste.\n\n2.7.2 Reuse\n\nReuse, examined in this section, is a waste prevention \nactivity that refers to giving a second life to products without \ndiscarding them, meaning that the items do not enter the waste \nmanagement system. Preparation for reuse refers to wasted \nproducts collected through a waste management system that \nundergo limited operations so they can be reused for the same \nfunction as before they became waste. Although reuse and \npreparation for reuse are high on the political agenda, both \nconcepts remain rather vague in the eyes of policymakers. \nThey include very different activities, such as individual sales at \nflea markets, organised waste management and third sector \nactivities. Because of a lack of consensus on the conceptual \nframework, it has so far been difficult to make conclusions \non the actual relevance of reuse and preparation for reuse in \nspecific waste regimes. The question of whether progress takes \nplace within the hierarchy, from disposal and recycling efforts \ntowards more reuse, remains open.\n\nOne of the key barriers is the lack of available data and its \npoor quality, without which the development of more effective \npolicies is not feasible. The revised EU WFD contains a number \nof provisions aimed at increasing reuse as an important form \nof waste prevention \u2014 and specifically aimed at developing \na monitoring framework. The WFD envisages that the \nCommission will adopt an implementing act to establish a \ncommon methodology for reporting and monitoring the reuse \nof products, which was adopted in late 2020. Data produced \nin accordance with this legislation will be available for the first \ntime in 2023, with reference to the year 2021.\n\nAgainst this background, the European Commission initiated a \nstudy to provide input to the development of a methodology \nfor measuring and reporting on the reuse of products and \npackaging and to establish formats for reporting as required \nunder Article 9 of the WFD (Gsell et al., 2019).\n\nWhen it comes to the reuse of packaging, screening of current \npractices has shown that 14 of the Member States that \nresponded intend to make use of the proposals for action \nincluded\tin\tthe\tEU\tpackaging\twaste\tlegislation\tand\t65\u00a0%\tof\tthe\t\nrespondents stated that they have registers of producers of \nreusable packaging (Gsell et al., 2019). The preferences with \nregard to an indicator for measuring the reuse of packaging \n\nBox 2.3 Avoidable vs unavoidable components of \nfood waste\n\nThe term 'food waste' comprises both avoidable and \nunavoidable food waste. Unavoidable food waste \nincludes eggshells, banana peels or coffee grounds. \nAvoidable food waste, on the other hand, would still \nhave been edible at the time of its disposal. This \nincludes leftovers and ripe fruit. This distinction is not \nstable over time and region, as it depends on cultural \neating habits, which vary around the world.\n\nIt is worth noting that the EU definition of food refers \nto food as a whole, including both parts intended and \nnot intended to be eaten ('avoidable' and 'unavoidable'). \nThis is also reflected in the measurement methodology \nestablished through dedicated legislation at the EU level; \nsee Commission Delegated Decision (EU/2019/1597).\n\nA great deal of effort is being put into education and \nawareness-raising campaigns, targeted at both producers and \nconsumers. In this respect, multi-stakeholder dialogues are \nbeing launched and have resulted in voluntary agreements and \ndeclarations on monitoring or reducing food waste. Apart from \nthe potential financial savings associated with reducing food \nwaste, additional arguments have been provided to incentivise \nwaste prevention, e.g. avoided greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMany of these initiatives have proven to effectively prevent food \nwaste. At the same time, available estimations of efficiencies \nhave often shown positive cost-benefit ratios: The avoidance \nof food waste can save significant costs, especially when \nconsidering mitigated environmental burdens (OECD, 2018).\n\nThe brief mapping of initiatives above shows that most \ncountries are active in promoting food waste prevention. \nHowever, the measures implemented so far are relatively light, \nfocusing on voluntary commitments or information provision. \nMany good practice examples are still at the stage of pilot \nprojects and should be broadened by ambitious prevention \npolicies, e.g. standardised date labels, obligatory reporting on \n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n30 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nwere equally distributed among the following options: \n(1)\u00a0reusable\tpackaging\tplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime\t\nas a share of all packaging placed on the market in a given year; \n(2) reusable packaging in rotation as a share of all packaging \nplaced on the market in a given year; and (3) reuse of packaging \nmeasured as the share of the rotations that reusable packaging \nis used in relation to all packaging used in a given year.\n\nHowever, waste prevention through reuse towards extending \nlifespans has gained importance for a number of product \ngroups. The national waste prevention programmes reviewed \nlist various types of measures, including:\n\n\u2022 supporting the establishment of reuse centres and markets \nfor used building materials, e.g. the network for the \nexchange of building components in Germany;\n\n\u2022 preparing guidelines for public procurement on new \ndevelopment, renovations and infrastructure construction \nthat is material efficient and supports the circular \neconomy\u00a0(Finland);\n\n\u2022 expanding the reuse networks in the federal provinces  \n(e.g. reuse of WEEE);\n\n\u2022 providing information on opportunities for reuse;\n\n\u2022 implementing an information and experience exchange \nplatform for reuse (e.g. Austria);\n\n\u2022 establishing procurement guidelines that facilitate reuse \n(e.g. adaptation of procurement law) or setting specific \nmandatory quotas for reused products;\n\n\u2022 verifying tax law measures in the areas of reuse and repair \nin the framework of a green tax reform (e.g. Austria);\n\n\u2022 organising campaigns to encourage reuse.\n\nThe analysis of different product groups has highlighted \ndiverging framework conditions, economic incentives and \nmarket shares of reuse systems. While reuse is an established \nmarket model for cars, it is still in its infancy for many other \nproduct groups. The recent focus of EU legislation on reuse, as \nexplained above, is expected to motivate European countries to \nintensify their efforts, especially with respect to product groups \naddressed by that legislation, namely electronics, furniture, \nconstruction materials and products and textiles\u00a0(10).\n\n(10) https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0019&from=EN \n\nBox 2.4 Reuse targets in Flanders (Belgium)\n\nThe Flemish government has approved an \nimplementation plan to focus on waste prevention and \nreuse in 2016.

At the EU level, this decoupling has not been \nobserved; total waste generation still closely follows economic \ndevelopments. However, for the period 2008-2018, total waste \ngenerated in the EU increased at a much lower pace than the \neconomy, signalling a relative decoupling.\n\nIt needs to be mentioned that waste extileon is influenced by \nmany socio-economic factors, and it is difficult to assess the \neffectiveness of waste prevention measures, because there \nis no one-to-one causality between prevention measures and \nwaste generation. Other demographic and socio-economic \nfactors also affect waste generation, such as population and \nhousehold size or the structure of the economy and its share of \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0019&from=EN\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n31Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nmore waste-intensive(e.g. construction) or less  waste-intensive \n(e.g. services) sectors. In this respect, the adoption of waste \nprevention programmes by EU Member States in 2013 does \nnot appear to have a direct and measurable effect on total \nEU\u00a0waste\u00a0generation.\n\nWhen looking at individual countries, 23 of the 30 examined \nshow decoupling of waste generation from economic growth \nin the period 2008-2018. In fact, 12 countries show a very \nhigh decrease in waste intensity, defined as waste generated \nper\u00a0unit\u00a0GDP.\n\nThe analysis has shown that 10 out of the 32 countries reviewed \nare not covered by a waste prevention programme (as of 2021). \nOnly eight countries have updated their programmes according \nto the revised WFD. This has direct consequences for our \nanalysis: as the new strategic orientation for waste prevention \npolicy, its links with the circular economy agenda and the \nstreams that are more in focus are not yet reflected in the \noverview of waste prevention efforts in Europe. However, this \nmight indicate a thorough overhaul of waste policy in countries \nwhere waste prevention policies will be aligned with broader \nwaste management policies and circular economy strategies, \nunlocking the potential for synergies.\n\nThe waste prevention programmes in place mainly target \nmunicipal waste, plastics and food waste, also reflecting \npolicy priorities at the EU level. However, a widening of \nwaste streams has been observed along with the updates. \nOther streams in focus are hazardous waste, electronics and \nmanufacturing\u00a0waste.\n\nMore than half of the measures adopted by the waste \nprevention programmes examined refer to information \nprovision and awareness-raising campaigns. There are \nindications that countries are moving towards more stringent \nprevention measures, and more regulatory or economic \n\ninstruments, and moving away from information provision, \nwhich might indicate more effective waste prevention in \nthe near future. However, the dominant type of waste \nprevention-related policy intervention is still to provide \ninformation and raise awareness. Shifting from simply \ninforming stakeholders about prevention to increased policy \npressure through legal instruments also indicates more \nmaturity in policy developments around prevention.\n\nHowever, to increase the effectiveness of waste prevention, \ncountries need to further diversify their portfolio of measures \nand align it with concrete targets and indicators. When \nit comes to targets and indicators, they seem to not be \nwidespread yet, presenting a challenge for monitoring the \nprogress of waste prevention implementation. Forthcoming \nactivities, particularly in the areas of food waste and reuse of \nproducts are expected to put these aspects more into focus. \nOverall, the amendment of the EU waste legislation in recent \nyears provides countries with a good opportunity to revise \ntheir waste prevention programmes and integrate these \nsuggestions into their official policy and review the lessons \nlearnt from the evaluation of expired waste prevention \nprogrammes (see EEA, 2021).\n\nOn the other hand, new policy initiatives, under the context \nof the EU's circular economy action plan are expected to \nhave a positive effect on waste prevention. Policy measures \nto support eco-design and in particular design for longevity \nfor a number of consumer products (e.g. electronics and \ntextiles) should in principle have an effect on the waste \ngeneration of these product groups. Similarly, initiatives that \naim to extend products' lifespans, such promoting repair and \nremanufacturing, would delay products from becoming waste. \nOverall, the spirit of the circular economy, which aims to retain \nthe value of materials and products in the economy as long as \npossible, translates into waste prevention, as the less waste is \nproduced the longer we keep using existing products.\n\f\n\u00a9 Adela Nistora, Environment & Me/EEA\n\f\n33Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n3\nPreventing textile waste \n\nin\u00a0Europe\n\n3.1 Introduction and scope\n\nThe textile industry is highly globalised, with millions of producers \nand billions of consumers spread across the world in highly \nlinear value chains involving raw material extraction, production, \ntransport, consumption and the end-of-life phase. Between 2000 \nand 2014, the global production of clothing almost doubled, while \nthe number of garments purchased by the average consumer \nincreased each year (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). In \naddition to the decreasing product quality and low product \nprices, the continual changes in fashion led consumers and the \nindustry to treat clothes as 'disposable' goods (Remy et al., 2016). \nThis phenomenon is captures in the expression 'fast fashion'. \nFast fashion refers to low-cost clothing collections that imitate \ncurrent luxury fashion trends (Joy et al., 2012); it is made possible \nby advanced technology, quick manufacturing and supply chain \ncontrol (Barnes and Lea-Greenwood, 2006). Fashion trends at \nlow prices encourage disposability and rapid turnover and they \nconsequently\tlead\tto\tlarge\tamounts\tof\twaste\t(Fletcher,\u00a02014).\n\nAs a result, the textile product system and the corresponding \ntextile waste are very relevant for applying waste prevention: \ngrowing waste stream, intensive and increasing consumption \nof products and short lifespans. This is recognised by the EU's \n2020 circular economy action plan, which specifically addresses \nthe textile value chain and has a strong focus on reuse and \nthe extension of product lifetime, which is one key pathway \ntowards\u00a0waste\tprevention.\n\nAgainst this background, this study aims to examine and \nassess the feasibility of preventing textile waste in Europe. \nMore concretely, it assesses the textile life cycle from a waste \nprevention perspective by following these steps:\n\n\u2022 compiling knowledge of textile flows and related \nenvironmental impacts;\n\n\u2022 understanding the key drivers of textile waste generation \nalong the value chain in order to scope prevention \nefforts\u00a0accordingly;\n\n\u2022 providing an overview of national textile waste prevention \nprogrammes and other policies and implemented practices \naiming at textile waste prevention;\n\n\u2022 reflecting on intervention points along the textile value \nchain towards waste prevention.\n\nThe study encompasses clothing and household textiles \n(e.g. clothes, towels, bed linen, curtains), while it excludes \nproducts in which textiles are not the dominant constituent \n(e.g. carpets, pillows, duvets). This means that clothing and \nhome textiles consumed by households and by government \nand business (e.g. uniforms used by the public and private \nsectors, bed linen and towels used by hotels and restaurants) \nare considered in the scope of the study. On the other \nhand, technical textiles that are not directly consumed by \nhouseholds (e.g. medical or automotive textiles) are not \nwithin the scope of this report. In the following sections, the \nterm 'textiles' is used in line with the scope of the report as \ndescribed here.\n\n3.2 Production and consumption of \ntextiles\u00a0in Europe and related \nenvironmental impacts\n\n3.2.1 Production and consumption of textiles\n\nTextiles and clothing represent an important manufacturing \nsector in Europe, making Europe the second largest \nexporter of textiles and clothing in the world, after \nChina (Euratex, 2020). Europe is a leading region for \nthe production of high-quality clothing and it is highly \ninnovative\u00a0in\ttextile\tresearch\tand\ttextile\tdesign\t \n(ETC/WMGE, 2019; Euratex, 2020). In 2018, the European \ntextile\tand\tclothing\tindustry\tcomprised\tabout\t171\u00a0000\t\ncompanies employing 1.7 million people and generating a \nturnover\tof\tEUR\u00a0178\u00a0billion\t(Euratex,\t2019).\tOver\t99\u00a0%\tof\t\ncompanies are micro enterprises or small or medium-sized \nenterprises\t(SMEs)\tand\t67\u00a0%\tare\tactive\tin\tclothing\t\n(Euratex,\u00a02020).\n\nIn 2018, the EU-27's domestic production of clothing and \nhousehold textiles (finished products) was just under \n1\u00a0million\ttonnes;\thowever,\tthe\tvolume\tof\timported\tclothing\t\nand\thousehold\ttextiles\twas\tover\t5\u00a0million\ttonnes\t(Figure\u00a03.1).\t\nChina, Turkey, Bangladesh and India are Europe's most \nimportant trade partners (ETC/WMGE, 2019).\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n34 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nWhile quantitative estimates are highly variable across \nsources, it is estimated that the apparent consumption of \nclothing\tand\thousehold\ttextiles\u00a0(11) of EU-27 households was \n5.4\tmillion\u00a0tonnes\tin\t2018,\tof\twhich\tclothing\taccounted\tfor\t\n4.4\u00a0million\u00a0tonnes\t(81\u00a0%,\t10\u00a0kg\tper\tcapita)\tand\thousehold\ttextiles\t\njust\tover\t1\u00a0million\ttonnes\t(19\u00a0%,\t2.3\u00a0kg\tper\tcapita)\t(JRC,\t2021).\tThis\t\nis\ta\t20\u00a0%\tincrease\tin\tapparent\tconsumption\tsince\t2003.\n\nWhen looking at the textile product system through a waste \nprevention and, broadly, circular economy lens, it is interesting to \nreflect on the type of clothing and household textiles consumed, \nas some items have greater potential for longer use, repair \nor reuse than others (JRC, 2021). For example, each year EU \nhouseholds\tpurchase\tover\t2.6\tmillion\ttonnes\t(6\u00a0kg\tper\tcapita)\t\nof coats, jackets, suits, shirts and trousers, which are often \ndiscarded before the end of their technical lifespan (e.g. because \nof fashion trends, the desire for new clothes or a lack of repair \nskills). As a result, these items have a high potential for reuse and \nare typically sold in second-hand shops across or outside Europe. \nOn the other hand, items such as underwear, pyjamas, hosiery \nand\thandkerchiefs\t(just\tunder\t80\u00a0000\ttonnes\ta\tyear,\t1.3\u00a0kg\tper\t\ncapita) are more likely to be used by their first user until the end \nof their technical life and are less attractive items for reuse (JRC, \n2021). These typically end up in mixed waste. Household textiles, \nespecially when used in a business context (e.g. bedlinen from \nhospitals and hotels) are interesting feedstock for recycling, as \nsuch waste streams have considerable volumes of consistent \nquality, but it can be assumed that they are rarely discarded \nbefore their service life ends and are thus unsuitable for reuse.\n\nA\trecent\tstudy\tin\tthe\tNetherlands\tconcluded\tthat\t5.6\u00a0%\tof\t\nmixed household waste in the country was textiles. Of that \nquantity, around one quarter is textiles that are suitable for \nreuse (https://www.afvalcirculair.nl/publicaties). This indicates \nthat the reuse potential for household clothes and textiles is \ncurrently not exhausted.\n\n3.2.2 Environmental impacts of the textile industry\n\nThe circular economy action plan states that 'textiles are the \nfourth highest pressure category for the use of primary raw \nmaterials and water, after food, housing and transport, and \nthe\tfifth\tfor\tGHG\t[greenhouse\tgas]\temissions'\t(EEA,\u00a02019;\t\nEuropean Commission, 2020b). The predominantly linear \nsystem of the textile industry is based on selling high volumes \nof short-lived clothing, which requires large amounts of \nnatural resources associated with negative societal and \nenvironmental impacts and waste generation (EEA, 2019;  \nETC/WMGE; 2019). The production and consumption \nof textiles and clothing, in particular, have significant \nenvironmental effects, including resource and land \nuse, greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant release. \nPrevention of textile waste by avoiding overconsumption \nand premature discard can thus prevent corresponding high \nenvironmental\u00a0impacts.\n\nFigure 3.2 gives an overview of the environmental impacts \nthat textiles have across their life cycle. The production of \nnatural fibres, such as cotton and wool, requires vast areas \nof arable land and uses large amounts of water, energy \nand agrochemicals. On the other hand, the manufacture of \nsynthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, is based on \nfossil fuel resources. The type and magnitude of impacts \ndepend on the type of fibre, but also on case-specific \nparameters, including specific production processes, the \ndyeing techniques used and fabric construction (van der \nVelden et al., 2014). As all fibres have their own environmental \nburdens and benefits, it is not straightforward to define a \nbest-in-class fibre or fabric (Beton et al., 2014). The production \nof yarn and fabric, however, involves using a myriad of \nprocessing and finishing chemicals as well as energy (see \nFigure 3.2). Production wastes also include process water \nloaded with chemicals and cuttings.\n\nFigure 3.1 Overview of the import, export, production and consumption flows of clothing and household \ntextiles in the EU-27 in 2018\n\nNotes: 'Stock'\trepresents\tthe\ttotal\tflow\tof\tclothing\tand\thousehold\ttextiles\tthrough\tthe\tEU-27\teconomy.\n\nSource: JRC (2021).\n\nIMPORT\n5.2 million tonnes\n(11.8 kg per capita)\n\nEXPORT\n0.76 million tonnes\n(1.7 kg per capita)\n\nAPPARENT CONSUMPTION\n5.4 million tonnes\n(12.3 kg per capital) SEPARATE WASTE COLLECTION\n\n1.6 - 2.5 million tonnes\n(3.6 - 5.7 kg per capita)\n\nEU-27 PRODUCTION\n0.95 million tonnes\n(2.2 kg per capita)\n\nSTOCK\n6.2 million tonnes\n\n(11) Apparent consumption = production + import - export.\n\nhttps://www.afvalcirculair.nl/publicaties\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n35Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nFigure 3.2 Environmental issues arising along the textile value chain\n\nSource: Based on ETC/WMGE (2019).\n\nRE\nUS\n\nE,\n R\n\nEP\nAI\n\nR,\n R\n\nED\n\nISTRIBUTE, REFURBISH, REM\nAN\n\nU\nFACTURE\n\nMATERIALS\nWASTE\n\nECO-DESIGN\n\nPRODUCTION\nAND DISTRIBUTION\n\nCONSUMPTION\nAND STOCK\n\nEM\nISSIO\n\nN\nS\n\nAGRICULTURE, EXTRACTION AND IMPORT OF NATURAL \nRESOURCES, INCLUDING ENERGY CARRIERS\n\nINCINERATION LANDFILL\n\nMinimise\n\nSynthetic fibres\nN\n\natural fibres\n\nChemical recycling\n\nMechanical recycling\n\nWater and energy use; \nextensive use of chemicals\ncausing water pollution\n\nFashion design hardly scopes\nlongevity (durability, repair\nand reusability, recyclability)\n\nNatural fibres are water\nand land intensive\n\nSynthetic fibres \ndominate the market, \nwhich are based on fossil fuels\n\nLow recycling rates, \nincineration and landfilling\nprevails\n\nUse of water and energy; \nrelease of microplastics and\nchemicals through laundering\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n36 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nRecent studies show that, in some cases, there is a greater \ndifference in environmental and climate impact between \ndifferent manufacturers of the same fibres and materials than \nbetween different types of textile fibres (Rex et al., 2019). This is \nimportant, as 80\u00a0% of our textiles' total climate impact occurs in \nthe production phase.\n\nConsequently, the use of chemicals during production and \nprocessing is a particular field of concern. Many chemicals used \nin textiles pose a significant risk to water bodies and human \nhealth, and, as a consequence, many are restricted or banned \nby the EU, including certain phthalates, azo colours and dyes, \nperfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) for surface \ntreatment, chromium (VI) in the tanning of leather for shoes \nand handbags, and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a biocide used \nto prevent mould (European Commission, 2009). For example, \nthe\tproduction\tof\t1\u00a0kg\tof\tcotton\tt-shirts\trequires\tabout\t3\u00a0kg\tof\t\nchemicals, such as dyes and finishing agents (KEMI, 2014).\n\nThe release of microplastics as an environmental impact has \ngained particular attention in recent years. Microplastics are \nreleased during production and the use (washing) of textiles, \n\nincluding polyester, acrylic and nylon, and end up in waste water. \nAs not all microplastics are filtered out in waste water treatment, \na significant share eventually ends up in the ocean. It is estimated \nthat globally about half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres \nare released each year (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). The \nlong-term environmental and health impacts of microplastics \npollution are still poorly understood (Henry et al., 2019; SAPEA, \n2019), but as they are ingested by aquatic species, it is clear they \nmay enter the human food chain, leading to chronic human \nexposure through food products (ETC/WMGE, 2021).\n\nWhen considering the full supply chain, the EU consumption \nof clothing, footwear and household textiles comes out as the \nsecond highest environmental pressure in terms of land use \n(after food), the fourth highest for resource and water use, and \nthe fifth highest for greenhouse gas emissions (EEA, 2019). In \nthe use phase, washing, drying and ironing require water and \nenergy; during these processes chemicals and microplastics are \nreleased into waste water.

Because a large part \nof the textiles that are consumed in Europe is imported from \nelsewhere in the world (mainly Asia), an important part of these \nenvironmental pressures is actually generated outside Europe. \nThis\tis\tthe\tcase\tfor\t85\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tmaterial\tuse,\t92\u00a0%\tof\tthe\twater\t\nuse,\t93\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tland\tuse\tand\t76\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tgreenhouse\tgas\t\nemissions,\tmaking\ttextiles\u00a0(12) the consumption domain with the \nhighest share of environmental impacts taking place outside \nEurope (ETC/WMGE, 2019).\n\n3.3 Textile waste generation in the EU\n\n3.3.1 The amount of textile waste\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement for Member States to report \non the volumes of separately collected used textiles and there \nis no standardised mapping or classification methodology \n(i.e. whether or not certain used textiles are considered waste \nor not) (Eurostat, 2020c; JRC, 2021; Watson et al., 2018). As a \nresult, data on separate collection are gappy and are often \nnon-comparable between countries. Furthermore, collected \namounts of used textiles vary greatly across countries (between \n0.3\tand\t15.3\u00a0kg/person)\t(JRC,\t2021).\n\nIt is estimated that about one third of textiles put on the \nmarket are collected separately, suggesting that two thirds \nend up in residual waste or are stocked. It is estimated that \nbetween\t1.6\u00a0and\t2.5\tmillion\ttonnes\tof\tpost-consumer\ttextiles\t\nis separately collected annually, corresponding to between \n3.6\u00a0and\t5.7\tkg/capita\t(JRC,\t2021).\tAs\tabout\ttwo\tthirds\tof\ttextiles\t\nare synthetic, an important share of this textile waste is of \nplastic origin (ETC/WMGE, 2021). Therefore, there is a significant \namount of non-separately collected textiles that are collected \nmixed with residual waste, rendering them unavailable for \nrecycling\tor\u00a0reuse.\n\nA large part of the textiles collected is meant for reuse (between \n50\u00a0%\tand\t75\u00a0%),\teither\twithin\tthe\tEU\tor\texported\tfor\tforeign\t\nmarkets (Watson et al., 2020). The largest share of the rest of \ncollected textile waste is recycled, but mostly in lower grade \nproducts. Still, high-quality fibre-to-fibre recycling is virtually \nnon-existent at the commercial scale on account of the many \ntechnical and commercial challenges (Textile Exchange, 2020), \nand textiles are generally downcycled into insulation or filling \n\nmaterials (ETC/WMGE, 2021). The remaining two thirds of \ntextile waste generated (about 4 million tonnes of textile waste) \nare assumed to end up in mixed municipal waste streams for \nincineration or landfill; there is thus an important opportunity for \nwaste prevention by encouraging increased reuse. In countries \nwith high separate collection rates, it can be expected that a \nsignificant share of textiles that ends up in the residual waste is of \ninferior quality; in these countries households already make a fair \nselection of those garments that are reusable (and are donated \nfor collection) and those that are not (JRC, 2021).\n\n3.3.2 Key drivers of textile waste generation\n\nThe increasing generation of textile waste cannot be traced \nback to one single driver but rather to a web of events that \noccurred within the past few decades, including a continuous \ndrop in production costs as a result of mass production \n(Ozdamar Ertekin and Atik, 2015) and outsourcing of production \nlabour. At the same time, a trend towards lower quality \nclothing has led to a decrease in clothing prices, making cheap \nmass-produced garments accessible to a wide audience. The \nacceleration of fashion trends, reduced product lifetimes \nand increased affordability have led to an acceleration in the \nconsumption of clothing, resulting in increased waste volumes.\n\nWhile average brands usually release around five collections \nper year, fast fashion brands provide up to 24 new clothing \ncollections each year (Sajn, 2019). It is therefore not surprising \nthat, between 2000 and 2014, the amount of garments \npurchased\tper\tperson\tincreased\tabout\t60\u00a0%\tglobally.\tWithin\t\nthe same period, clothing production doubled and generated \n14 items of clothing for every person on Earth in 2014 (Remy \net al., 2016). It therefore may be considered that consumption \nin the textile industry is not necessarily driven by functional \nbenefits but rather by the drive to satisfy emotional needs and \nby symbolic and social communication, also known as 'style \nconsumption' (Cho et al, 2015). Hence, fast fashion has allowed \neveryone to consume style, follow the latest trends and meet \ntheir emotional needs (Gazzola et al., 2020).\n\nThe growth in the use of digital advertising and social media by \nfast fashion brands has caused a quickly shifting demand from \nconsumers and created a 'buy now, throw away tomorrow' \nculture. A survey conducted by WRAP revealed that the lifespan \nof clothes has decreased and that they are also worn less often. \nIn Europe, the average lifespan of a clothing item is currently \nup to 5 years (WRAP, 2019). Worldwide, the number of times \na\tgarment\tis\tworn\thas\tdecreased\tby\t36\u00a0%\tfrom\t15\tyears\tago\t\n(Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).\n\n(12) Clothing, footwear and household textiles as calculated with Exiobase 3.4.\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n38 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nDigitalisation and data analytics have also served as an \naccelerator, helping fashion brands to develop a nimble and \nefficient supply chain that cuts down production cycles to \nless\tthan\t3\tweeks.\tInventory\tmanagement\tsystems\t(i.e.\u00a0stockkeeping units) have therefore been established to track \ngoods until purchased by the consumer, enabling fast fashion \nbrands to quickly analyse and process data about each store's \ninventory levels and the popularity of each unit and the speed \nat which it sells.\n\nIn the meantime, a wide range of clothing has become accessible \nthrough a mouse click, a phenomenon largely accelerated during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Clothes and sports goods are the top \ncategory of online purchases (see Figure 3.4).\tAround\t65\u00a0%\tof\t\nshoppers in the EU state that they have purchased clothing \nonline\tin\tthe\tpast\t12\tmonths.\tAround\t70\u00a0%\tof\tthese\te-shoppers\t\nare aged 16-24 years (Eurostat, 2020b). According to a survey by \nMastercard,\t48\u00a0%\tof\tEuropean\tconsumers\tpurchase\ttheir\tclothing\t\nand footwear online (Mastercard, 2017).\n\nIn addition to the growth in fashion e-commerce, return rates \nof\tunwanted\tclothing\talso\tincreased.\tWhile\talmost\t10\u00a0%\tof\t\nclothes purchased in stores are returned, the number of clothes \npurchased online being returned is three times higher, which \nrelates to the inability to physically see, feel and try on the \nproduct beforehand (Statista, 2021). The journey of returned \nclothes therefore remains widely unknown. Returned clothes \nthat are not damaged are usually sold at lower prices at \ndiscounters or outlets and/or become deadstock of retailers, \nwhich in general implies a system of 'overordering'. Depending \non the returns policy, retailers have the chance to return \ntheir products to the supplier, who will re-sell those products \nto other markets or treat them as waste. This reverse flow \nalong the supply chain is a crucial part of the clothing industry \nand is legitimised through overproduction, overordering and \nunregulated return policies (Shen and Li, 2015).\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nPercentage\n\nE-learning material\n\nMedicine\n\nComputer hardware\n\nTelecommunication services\n\nFilms/music\n\nFood or groceries\n\nElectronic equipement\n\nBooks/magazines/newspapers\n\nTickets for events\n\nHousehold goods (e.g. furniture, toys)\n\nTravel and holiday accommodation\n\nClothes, sports goods\n\nFigure 3.4 Role of clothing in e-commerce: online purchases, EU-27\n\nSource: Eurostat (2020b).\n\nhttps://www.statista.com\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n39Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n3.4 Policy background on textile \nwaste\u00a0prevention\n\n3.4.1 Global level\n\nThe UN agencies and allied organisations launched the \ninitiative 'Alliance for Sustainable Fashion' in 2018. The main \nobjective of this alliance is to contribute to the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) through coordinated actions in the \nfashion sector\u00a0(13), such as through the promotion of active \ncollaboration, knowledge sharing, strengthening synergies \nand outreach and advocacy. The UN committed to changing \nthe path of fashion towards reduced environmental and social \nimpacts, which resulted in the UN initiative 'SDGs for Better \nFashion', addressing SDGs\u00a04, 9, 12 and 13.\n\nIn addition to these efforts and the establishment of initiatives, \nsuch as the UN One Planet Network and the UN Environment \nProgramme Circularity Platform, programmes aiming \nparticularly at the prevention of textile waste have yet not been \ninitiated in the EU.\n\n3.4.2 EU level\n\nThe circular economy action plan (European Commission, \n2020a) takes a broader approach and paves Europe's way to \nextil responsibility for its own waste. The textile value chain \nhas been selected as a core sector and policy priority for the \ntransition to a circular economy (European Commission, 2020a). \n\nA sectoral plan for textiles is therefore part of the new circular \neconomy strategy (2020a) and a is a priority in the European \nGreen Deal (European Commission, 2019).\n\nFor 2021, the release of an EU strategy for sustainable textiles \nhas been announced\u00a0(14). The upcoming proposal by the \nCommission in this regard will eventually build on existing and \nnew tools to promote the market for sustainable and circular \ntextiles within the EU.\n\nThe\tTextile\tRegulation\t((EU)\tNo\u00a01007/2011)\ton\ttextile\tfibre\t\nnames and related labelling and marking of the fibre \ncomposition of textile products\u00a0(14), for instance, requires that \ntextile products sold in the EU are labelled or marked to provide \ninformation about their fibre composition. Another significant \nbody of the EU policy instrument is the REACH (Registration, \nEvaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals) Regulation ((EC) \nNo\u00a01907/2006),\twhich\trequires\tthe\tregistration\tof\tsubstances\t\nincorporated in textiles during production processes in Europe. \nTextiles produced outside the EU are regulated through \nthe voluntary EU ecolabel for textiles (Commission Decision \n2014/350/EU) and the EU green public procurement criteria for \ntextiles\tproducts\tand\tservices\u00a0(15).\n\nThe revised Waste Framework Directive ((EU) 2018/851), with its \noverall goal of valuing waste as a resource, obliges all Member \nStates to collect its textile waste separately by 2025. This \nregulation is expected to reduce the amount of textile waste \nending up in residual waste and increase the amount that is \navailable for reuse or recycling.\n\nBox 3.1 The role of e-commerce\n\nBecause of the ease of buying clothes, mobile applications and web platforms related to the circular economy and online \nshopping have grown significantly. Nevertheless, demand for circular economy products and alternatives is still rather low \nand most companies that have developed circular e-commerce models for textiles focusing on extended life cycles and \nreuse are small-scale businesses (Faria et al., 2020). The models may involve a pre-paid return label for the shipment of \nold and unwanted personal clothing items with each purchase and incentivising the consumer to participate in a return \nprogramme by offering discounts on the next purchase. Returned clothes can be resold or donated to select charities \n(Cision, 2019).\n\nData on the textile flows involved in e-commerce for the reuse of second-hand textiles are difficult to obtain. Informal \nreuse and the new market that has emerged via apps and the web are especially a challenge.\n\nThe Swedish Environmental Protection Agency study on e-commerce of second-hand clothing indicated that such activities \nincreased\t32\u00a0%\tin\t1\tyear\t(2016\u20142017).\tThe\tamount\twas\tapproximately\t0.13\u00a0kg\tper\tperson,\tor\tequivalent\tto\tthe\tweight\t\nof one cap. Women's clothes dominates the market and represents almost half of the textiles sold. Children's clothes \nrepresent about one third and men's about one sixth.

Reuse and recycling \noutlets will need to be created, as the current sorting and \nrecycling capacities are not sufficient to process the anticipated \nvolumes (Hardy, 2020). However, it is also expected that at least \nhalf of these additional volumes will comprise non-reusable \ntextile\twaste\t(JRC,\u00a02021).\n\n3.4.3 EEA member countries' national and regional \nwaste prevention programmes \n\nWaste prevention programmes have been officially adopted \nby 30 EEA member countries: the 27 EU Member States and \nthree non-EU countries that are members of the EEA (Iceland, \nNorway and Switzerland). An assessment of these programmes \nshowcases the measures, indicators and targets envisaged for \ntackling textile waste prevention.\n\nMeasures\n\nThe slight majority (16 of 30) of waste prevention programmes \nin Europe already include measures that specifically address \n\ntextile waste. In total, 40 measures have been recorded across \nall programmes. Some programmes. e.g. those of Denmark or \nSlovenia, have specific sub-chapters that deal with textile waste \ngeneration and linked environmental impacts.\n\nThe measures to prevent  textile waste cover a wide range \nof types, from voluntary and simply suggested measures to \nmarket-based incentives and stringent regulatory market \ninterventions. They mainly relate to the reuse and repair \nof textiles, i.e. the improvement of collection systems and \nmarket penetration of used clothes to enable, improve and \nincrease their reuse (see Table 3.1). Furthermore, it was \nnoted that agreements and partnerships tend to focus on \nawareness-raising campaigns and that regulatory measures, \nso far, focus on reducing the use of chemicals in textiles \n(part of qualitative waste prevention, referring to reducing \nenvironmental impacts from waste management).\n\nTextiles and especially clothing might, of course, also be \nincluded in general waste prevention measures, such as in the \nsupport for reuse of discarded products in general. Additionally, \ntextile waste prevention is considered as an action field in \nnational and regional policy strategies and regulations beyond \nthe waste prevention programmes (see Box 3.2).\n\nTable 3.1 Examples of textile waste prevention measures listed in the national waste \nprevention\u00a0programmes\n\nInformation and \nawareness-raising\n\nAnalysis of the textile industry (e.g. textile material flows) (Austria)\n\nTechnically ensure the dissemination of information and awareness programmes for a \nprogressive increase in the number of products collected for further use, e.g. textiles, clothing, \nfootwear and other reusable products (Czechia)\n\nEstablishment of a voluntary event for selling used clothing before the start of the school \nyear\u00a0(Greece)\n\nMarket-based incentives Reduce value added tax on the repair of bicycles, shoes, leather goods, clothing and electrical \nappliances,\tfrom\t25\u00a0%\tto\t12\u00a0%\tas\tof\t1\u00a0January\t2017\tin\tSweden and also in Austria\tfrom\t20\u00a0%\tto\t\n10\u00a0%\tfrom\t1\u00a0January\t2021\n\nReduce\tcost\tof\trepair\tthrough\ta\t50\u00a0%\tdeduction\tof\tlabour\tcost\tfor\trepairs\tof\ttextiles\tthrough\t\ngovernment subsidy (Sweden)\n\nLow\tvalue\tadded\ttax\ton\tthe\trepair\tof\tclothing,\te.g.\tof\t6\u00a0%\t(Belgium)\n\nReduction in patent taxes for small businesses whose activities lead to the reuse of a product \n(e.g. repair of shoes, furniture and clothing) (Bulgaria)\n\nWork to establish environmental targets for public procurement of textiles and textile \nservices\u00a0(Denmark)\n\nVoluntary agreements \nand cooperation \nplatforms\n\nPartnerships with vendors to increase the market share of eco-labelled textiles or textiles that \ncontain a minimal amount of harmful substances (Iceland)\n\nA partnership with companies and organisations with the slogan 'Give your clothes a longer life' \n(Denmark)\n\nRegulatory measures Support stricter international regulations regarding the use of chemicals in textiles (Norway)\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n41Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nIndicators\n\nCurrently, only 6 out of 31 national and regional waste \nprevention programmes include specific indicators on textile \nwaste prevention (Box 3.3). The majority of these indicators \nfocus on reuse or preparation for reuse of clothing and \nfootwear. Some indicators also cover qualitative prevention \n(e.g.\u00a0with\tregard\tto\teco-labelled\tclothing)\tand\tthe\tquantities\tput\t\non the market \u2014 based on available consumer market statistics \n(e.g. the Icelandic programme uses indicators on consumer \nexpenditure as an indicator for waste prevention).\n\nBox 3.2 Examples of national and regional policy strategies and regulations beyond the waste prevention \nprogrammes\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nThe steps taken in the Netherlands over the past 10 years addressing the intervention points along the textile value \nchain can be highlighted as best practice. In 2012, the Netherlands introduced a Green Deal on textiles, with the overall \ngoal of halving the quantities of textiles in residual waste between 2012 and 2015. The Green Deal aimed to achieve this \nthrough improved mapping of textile flows, common communications on what can and cannot be delivered to containers, \ninitiatives aimed at behavioural change and assisting municipalities in setting achievable targets. This was followed by the \nDutch Agreement on Sustainable Garments and Textile in 2016, signed by a broad coalition of partners, including industry \nassociations, trade unions, non-governmental organisations and the Government of the Netherlands. These businesses \nand organisations thereby committed to extil measures towards a reduction of waste in the garment and textile sector in \naccordance with the European circular economy ambitions (SER, 2016). Furthermore, the Dutch circular textile programme \n2020-2025 has also been implemented, setting objectives along the supply chain enabling long-term use and reuse of \ntextiles (van Veldhoven, 2020). In 2021, additional goals/targets for reuse within the Netherlands were set in a progress \nreport on the Dutch circular textile waste programme 2020-2025, which was presented to the Dutch parliament. By 2025, \n10\u00a0%\tof\ttextiles\tcollected\tin\tthe\tNetherlands\tneeds\tto\tbe\treused\twithin\tthe\tNetherlands;\tby\t2030\tthis\tshould\tbe\t15\u00a0%\t\n(Government of the Netherlands, 2021).\n\nGermany\n\nWith the amendment to the Circular Economy Act, the Due Diligence Act (in German 'Obhutspflicht') was introduced by \nthe German government in 2020, marking a new form of product responsibility. It focuses on goods returned following \nonline purchases as a critical factor for waste generation and refers to all products and their distribution processes \n(including transport and storing). By focusing on the textile industry in particular, the regulation represents an upfront \nduty to prevent textile waste (BMU, 2020). The Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety \n(BMU) is currently conducting transparency dialogues with trade associations, online retailers, tertiary users and others \nto understand the underlying reasons for product destruction and how transparency on this matter could be achieved \n(BMU, 2019). Once transparency measures addressing the destruction of textile products are implemented, the volumes of \ntextile\twaste\tin\tGermany\tcan\tbe\testimated.and\thousehold\ttextiles\tis\tremarkable,\tit\tamounts\tto\tonly\tabout\t1\u00a0%\tof\tnew\tsales\t\n(Elander et al., 2019). \n\nOverall, the uptake of indicator in countries is hampered by the \nfact that textile waste statistics are not collected in all countries. \nTherefore, some countries resort to proxy indicators, such \nas the amount of textiles placed on the market, to estimate \nthe effect of prevention measures. Other countries choose to \nmonitor specific aspects of waste prevention, such as reuse, \nwhich is of course very relevant for textiles. However, not \nmany countries have chosen to include specific indicators for \nmonitoring textile waste prevention. This status might change \nwith the introduction of the mandatory separate collection of \ntextile waste in 2025 and the forthcoming EU textile strategy.\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n42 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTargets\n\nNone of the currently available waste prevention programmes \ninclude quantified targets for preventing textile waste. The \nNetherlands, however, recently adopted a reuse target of \n10\u00a0%\tof\ttextiles\tcollected\tby\t2025,\tincreasing\tto\t15\u00a0%\tby\t2030\t\n(Government of the Netherlands, 2021). Textile waste is \nnevertheless often mentioned in the context of general targets \nfor municipal solid waste (e.g. in France) or with regard to \nwaste products that are supposed to be collected separately in \nthe\u00a0future.\n\nThe absence of concrete targets is a major drawback of \nefforts to prevent textile waste, as a solid target drives the \ndevelopment of comprehensive policies, including subsequent \nmeasures to support the target and indicators for monitoring \nprogress and data collection.\n\nConclusions on textile waste prevention in the national \nprevention programmes\n\nCompared with prevention measures on other waste \nstreams, such as plastics and packaging waste (see EEA, 2019), \nmeasures targeting textile waste are fewer in number but a \nhigher share of textile-related measures aimed at qualitative \nprevention, inspired by the knowledge that chemicals in \ntextiles might be harmful for humans (thus not targeting waste \nprevention\u00a0directly).\n\nThe analysis also shows that, despite the increasing awareness \nof the steeply increasing amount of textile waste generated and \nthe serious environmental impacts occurring along the value \n\nBox 3.3 Textile waste prevention indicators in national waste prevention programmes\n\nAustria Quantity of reusable used products (e.g. textiles) collected per year\n\nQuantity of reused products (e.g. textiles) sold annually\n\nCyprus Quantity of materials (WEEE, clothes, furniture) re-introduced into the market (number of pieces)\n\nRepair of WEEE, clothing, furniture and toys (percentage)\n\nCzechia The amount of textiles, footwear and selected reusable products collected, in tonnes/year \n\nDenmark Consumption of clothing and textiles, including recycled items\n\nTrends in the prevalence of eco-labelled clothing and textiles\n\nIceland The market share of clothing produced by environmentally friendly means or containing small \nquantities of hazardous substances\n\nAverage household clothing purchases per year (adjusted for consumer price index, \nexcluding\u00a0housing)\n\nSlovenia The amount of textile waste and waste clothing\n\nNetherlands Overall reduction of waste\n\nReduction in the amount of textiles discarded\n\nNote: WEEE, waste electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nchain, the issue of preventing textile waste has just started \nto gain attention and relevance in national waste prevention \nprogrammes. The circular economy action plan of the EU, \nwhich was recently adopted, puts extra emphasis on the textile \nproduct system. It is expected that the next versions of the \nnational waste prevention programmes will increasingly adopt \nmeasures to address textile waste prevention across the board \nof targets, measures, indicators and data collection systems.\n\n3.5 Intervention points for textile waste \nprevention along the life cycle stages\n\nThis section assesses waste prevention measures that can \nbe undertaken throughout textiles' life cycle that lead to the \nreduction of textile waste. It highlights barriers to and success \nfactors for the implementation of measures and draws \nconclusions to support policy options. As intervention measures \ncan and should be considered at each stage along the value \nchain, the measures are discussed for each stage separately (for \nan overview of the value chain, see Figure 3.2).\n\n3.5.1 Product design\n\nProduct design represents a crucial phase for the longevity of \ntextiles through material choice, fibre blend and the production \nprocesses used (e.g. knitting or sewing techniques). The design \nphase also determines the potential for textiles to be recovered \n(i.e. recycled or upcycled; UNEP, 2020), which could also be \nconsidered waste prevention by avoiding environmental impacts \nfrom waste management (i.e. avoiding disposal). Eco-design is \n\nhttps://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2021/05/20/voortgangsrapportage-circulair-textiel\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n43Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nthe principle of designing for longevity, which again consists of \nthree design principles: (1) design for durability, (2) design for \nlong-lasting style and (3) design for disassembly (Circular Fashion, \n2019). Design for durability aims to create textile products that \nare resilient to wear and tear and can withstand abrasion and \nwashing, whereas design for long-lasting style aims to create \ntimeless items that appeal to a broad audience by satisfying \nconsumers' fashion sense. Lastly, design for disassembly aims \nto create products that can be taken apart easily to facilitate \nmaintenance, repair, reuse or recycling (ETC/WMGE, 2019).\n\nEver more brands and businesses are establishing eco-design \nprinciples aiming for high-quality products with a long use \nphase and they therefore position themselves in new emerging \n'slow fashion' markets. Some even follow the concept of 'zero \nwaste design'. Technique-wise, zero waste design involves fitting \nall the flat pieces of the clothing pattern together like a jigsaw \npuzzle so that no fabric is wasted. Considering that roughly \n15\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tfabric\tis\tdiscarded\twhen\ta\ttypical\tgarment\tis\tmade,\t\nthe cumulative effect of zero waste manufacturing can have \nsignificant environmental benefits (Wright, 2017). Labels and \ncertification programmes addressing the longevity of textiles \nand/or including the aspect of longevity in existing labels and \ncertifications can also provide an incentive for such waste \nprevention-compliant design.\n\nAn approach at the policy level has been made in the Dutch \ncircular textile programme 2020-2025, which states that all \ntextile products should be designed for long-term use by \nusing materials that are long lasting and can be reused to a \nhigh standard (van Veldhoven, 2020). An extended producer \nresponsibility (EPR) scheme for textiles to accelerate these \nprocesses is discussed (Government of the Netherlands, 2020). \nHowever, as ubiquitous incentives and regulatory measures \nto encourage eco-design are still missing, the consideration \nof longevity in the textile industry is lacking and compounded \nwith a long implementation phase for such an initiative. This \nstage is therefore crucial, as it is the design phase that strongly \ndetermines the technical reusability, repairability and, hence, \nlongevity of textile products (coupled with circular business \nmodels to recirculate unwanted textiles to new users).\n\n3.5.2 Production and distribution\n\nThe production phase involves fibre and fabric production, \ncutting and sewing. Garment construction processes determine \nthe quality of the resulting textile product, its durability and \nlifespan. Production systems for fast fashion are oriented \nmore towards speed than quality, creating a vast amount \nof 'disposable' clothing. Gentle (i.e. sustainable) production \nsystems with regard to chemical use in particular can ensure \nlong-lasting clothing items that are recyclable.\n\nOne core issue at this stage, however, is the overproduction that \ngenerates large amounts of (unused) textile items ending up as \nwaste. To prevent overproduction, some brands have embraced \n\na demand-driven model in which consumers pre-order \ngarments. Moreover, brands could support customers to take an \neven greater guiding role in the development of clothing items \nby producing customised items on demand, based, for instance, \non consumers' designs or simulations. Social media, bloggers, \ninfluencers and peer review play an important role in this trend.\n\nPolicy interventions for the textile production stage are not yet \npresent at the European level. However, possible considerations \nof measures such as a ban on the destruction of unsold items \n(already in place in France and Germany and potentially to be \nincluded in the EU sustainable products initiative) or waste \nprevention targets for the production stage can influence the \navoidance of production waste and incentivise the control \nof\u00a0overproduction.\n\nWith the rising relevance of online clothing markets, slow fashion \ntrends are required to adjust and reorient accordingly. While \nonline platforms ease and accelerate the purchase of clothing, \nthey also have potential for raising awareness and changing \nbehaviour\tthrough\tthe\tpromotion\tof\tcertain\tsocial\tnorms\t(e.g.\u00a0by\t\n'green nudging'). Alternative business models (e.g. reuse or \nleasing) are therefore increasingly implemented by start-ups.\n\n3.5.3 Use and maintenance\n\nThe use phase of clothing has shortened significantly over \nrecent decades. This is to some extent explained by the lower \nquality of clothing items provided on the market but also by \nchanges in consumption patterns and societal expectations of \nclothing. Apparel is no longer purchased to fulfil an essential \nhuman need but to meet seasonal fashion trends.\n\nAccording to a survey, around one in five consumers purchase \nclothing items every 14 days and are 'high-frequency \npurchasers' (WRAP, 2019). Around half of consumers purchase \nmonthly or every few months ('medium-frequency purchasers'), \nwhile one in three make purchases a few times a year or less \n('low-frequency purchasers'). The study also reveals a high \nassociation between frequency of purchase and age, as people \nbetween 18 and 34 years are more likely to be classified as \nhigh-frequency purchasers. It is the same group that reports the \nshortest longevity of their clothing (WRAP, 2019). This reveals \na clear group for targeting with awareness-raising campaigns \non reuse and repair activities and new consumption models. \nIt is, however, the same age group that is also targeted by fast \nfashion models and incentives to consume it on social media.\n\nBy encouraging consumers to use the concepts of longer \nuse, reuse and shared use, the volumes of textiles purchased \n(and wasted) could be reduced. This, however, requires \nproduct design and logistics services supporting collaborative \nconsumption models (Box 3.4). One barrier for reuse models \nsuch as second-hand clothing includes prejudices about worn \nclothing in terms of quality, hygiene or diversity of products on \noffer (Kleinh\u00fcckelkotten et al., 2017).\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n44 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nDespite the variety of awareness-raising campaigns that can \nbe undertaken to address the challenges described, a certain \nattitude-behaviour gap remains, which raises questions about \nthe alignment between awareness and actual actions to prevent \ntextile waste.\n\nReuse or repair services could be encouraged by economic \nincentives, such as tax breaks. The Swedish government set \neconomic incentives for the longer use of consumer items \nby giving tax breaks for repair services in 2017. The value \nadded tax (VAT) for repair services, including those on textiles, \ndecreased\tby\tabout\t50\u00a0%\t(from\t25\u00a0%\tto\t12\u00a0%).\tThe\trationale\t\nbehind this is that, by reducing the overall costs of repair \nservices, the use phase of items would be extended and waste \nprevented. Although an exact correlation cannot be drawn, an \nincrease in shoe repair services has been noticed within the \npast few years (Dalhammar et al., 2020).\n\nRecently, circular economy-inspired business models that \npromote sharing or leasing of clothes have been developed \nby new companies or by modifying the business models of \nexisting companies. Most of these models target specific \nclothing types, such as long-lasting coats or baby clothes, \nwhich are more likely to be discarded by consumers before \n\nBox 3.4 Examples of collaborative textile consumption models\n\nReuse: fashion library\n\nAn example of a collaborative consumption business model for extended life cycles of textiles is the clothing library, in \nwhich\ta\tmonthly\tmembership\tfee\t(often\tEUR\u00a030-60)\tallows\tmembers\tto\tborrow\ta\tspecific\tnumber\tof\tpieces\tof\tclothing\tin\ta\t\nset time, typically a few weeks.\n\nZamani et al. (2017) found that clothing libraries can extend the life cycle of a garment two to four times and proportionally \nreduce the production of new clothing and the associated waste generation and other environmental impacts.\n\nClothing libraries are typically small-scale enterprises, many of which are managed as secondary side businesses. The \ncurrent impact on textile waste material flows is minor (Tojo et al., 2012), albeit steadily increasing. Several studies (Elander \net al., 2017; Zamani et al., 2017; Yuan and Shen, 2019 ) report the importance of easy access and services (e-platforms and \ncentral locations of shops). Efficient logistics and good agreements with suppliers are crucial. Brand owners are generally \nquite positive about clothing libraries, even though one can see a contradiction with the retail model. Some brand owners \nhave set up their own renting services, with the additional benefit of increased customer engagement and decreased \nproduct returns (Yuan and Shen, 2019).\n\nSwap till you drop\n\nA clothing swap is a type of swap meet during which participants exchange their valued, but no longer used, clothing for \nclothes that they will use. A clothing swap underlines the difference between 'end-of-use' and 'end-of-life' items and tries to \nget maximum use from end-of-use items (Rathinamoorthy et al., 2019).\n\nAs part of its 'Love your clothes' campaign, Milieu Centraal in the Netherlands is promoting the informal, non-commercial \ncollaborative consumption system for clothing, called 'Swap till you drop' (Milieu Centraal, undated). It informs the \nconsumer about the rules and benefits and gives practical advice on how to arrange clothing swaps. It also links to public \nclothing exchange events taking place at various locations in the Netherlands and to social media sites, where interested \nswap party organisers can post about their own event.\n\ntheir service life has ended. Although these models aim to \nuse clothes as much as possible and avoid discarding them \nwhile still useful, there is currently no evidence on their \neffect on waste prevention. Depending on other factors, \nsuch as the cost of such leasing or sharing services, these \nmodels might risk increasing the number of clothing items in \npeople's wardrobes and, perhaps, consequently increasing the \nproduction of clothes.\n\nA common public policy measure that can promote circularity \nand waste prevention is green public procurement, which is \nincreasingly seen as offering significant opportunities in this \nrespect (Box 3.5). Green public procurement can encourage \nshifts towards the use of non-toxic chemicals in production, \nzero waste design and extended life cycles based on greater \ndurability, reparability, etc. Public procurers can, for example, \nshare assets (e.g. in terms of joint procurement and reuse) or \nset requirements that ensure a prolonged product life through \nmaintenance,\trepair\tand\tdesign\tfor\tdurability\t(Alhola\u00a0et\tal.,\t\n2018). Other sector-specific opportunities for circular public \nprocurement aiming to prevent waste are extending the life \ncycle by renting workwear instead of owning it or setting \nrequirements for the elimination of toxic substances, aiming to \nachieve qualitative waste prevention. \n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n45Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBox 3.5 Example of green public procurement and \ntextile waste prevention \n\nAn example of successful textile waste prevention was \ngiven by the Herning municipality in Denmark. The \naim was to extend the lifespan of working clothes and \nto ensure that the clothes and materials were used \nmore efficiently. Detailed guidance on the criteria for \nthe reuse, repair and disposal of working clothes was \ndeveloped. Estimated savings for the municipality \nwere\tEUR\t6\u00a0700\tand\t1\u00a0011\u00a0t\u00a0CO2 over a 4-year period \nin Herning's technical operations department (Hillgr\u00e9n \net al., 2015). Extrapolating these figures based on \nthe number of inhabitants in Herning implies that, if \nimplemented at the national level, such a relatively easy \nmeasure would result in a saving of 117.1\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2 for all \nof\tDenmark\t(with\ta\tsaving\tof\tEUR\u00a0776\u00a0000\tover\t4\tyears\t\nfor its 5.79 million inhabitants.\n\nBox 3.6 The role of non-governmental \norganisations in textile reuse\n\nToday, in the majority of European countries, \nthe collection of used textiles is mainly handled \nby non-governmental organisations or charity \norganisations, which provide this service to get raw \nmaterials for their own activities, reselling or recycling. \nFinnish and Swedish reports indicate that the volumes \ncollected are 3-4\u00a0kg/inhabitant (Belleza and Luukka, \n2018; Dahlbo et al., 2016), which is in the same order \nas in France (3.18\u00a0kg/inhabitant per year), where the \ncollection is more formal and arranged based on the \nfrench extended producer responsibility scheme for \ntextiles (Bukhari et al., 2018).\n\nDenmark has a well-developed market for the reuse of \ntextiles through charity shops. In 2016, around 10\u00a0600 \ntonnes of textiles were reused in Denmark and around \n15\u00a0300\u00a0tonnes were exported to be reused elsewhere \n(Milj\u00f8styrelsen, 2018).\n\nTypically, only a smaller share of collected textiles \nare going to domestic reuse. In Finland this is 21\u00a0%,\t\nand in Sweden and France even less. The bulk of all \ntextiles collected are exported (Bukhari et al., 2018; \nWatson\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\t2020).\n\nThe markets for domestic, European and international \nreuse have been shrinking in the last few years. The \nquality of new clothing is becoming lower and the \nexport of clothing to developing countries is becoming \nmore difficult. The latter is because of the demand for \nbetter quality items and, moreover, some countries \nhave placed bans on the import of used goods. In \nFrance, for example, the volumes of items going for \nreuse has decreased by between 10\u00a0%\tand\t15\u00a0%\tduring\t\nthe last 3-4 years (Bukhari et al., 2018).\n\n3.5.4 Reuse\n\nHigh-quality textile reuse represents an opportunity for the \nEuropean textiles industry to reduce its environmental impacts, \nproviding that sufficient sorting capacity is available, including \npre-sorting at source (e.g. separate collection of carpets, reusable \nclothing, denim, non-reusable items). By encouraging consumers \nto use textiles for longer and to repair, reuse and share their \ntextiles, the volumes of textiles purchased and wasted could \nbe reduced, despite potential rebound effects linked to the \nconsumption of second-hand clothing. Currently, textile collection \nand sorting for reuse are often dominated by non-governmental \norganisations\tand\tcharity\torganisations\t(Box\u00a03.6).\tWhen\tthe\t\nseparate collection of textile waste is obligatory in all Member \nStates\tafter\t1\u00a0January\t2025,\tharmonisation\tof\tsorting\tprocedures\t\namong Member States will be crucial to support efficient intra-EU \ntrade of reusable textiles (ETC/WMGE, 2021).\n\nEPR systems with eco-modulated fees are often proposed to \nencourage the collection of items for reuse and recycling, while \nstimulating the use of recycled fibres in new products. EPR \nschemes might lead to waste prevention directly in the case of \nthe reuse of collected textiles without preparation or indirectly \nby, for instance, promoting durable textile design through \neco-modulation. To date, France is the only Member State that \nhas\testablished\ta\tmandatory\tEPR\tscheme\u00a0(16) (see Box 3.7) for \nclothing, footwear and household textiles (Article L-541-10-3 of \n\n(16) An EPR promotes life cycle improvements in products by giving the manufacturer the responsibility for the final disposal phase in particular \n(Lindhqvist, 2000). \n\nthe Code de l'Environnement). According to this regulation, all \nlegal entities presenting new textiles and clothing on the French \nmarket (i.e. garments, footwear and household linen) are held \nresponsible for the end-of-life phase. As a consequence, the \ncollection rate for reuse and recycling in France doubled from \n18\u00a0%\tto\t36\u00a0%\tbetween\t2009\tand\t2017\t(Bukhari\tet\tal.,\t2018;\tEllen\t\nMacArthur Foundation, 2017).

Exchanges of clothes \nbetween family and friends and the blooming of peer-to-peer \nonline market platforms constitute a potentially significant part \nof textile reuse. However, no data exist on the amounts of such \nreused textiles in Europe.\n\nFigure 3.5 outlines all potential measures and innovative steps \nthat can be undertaken throughout the textile supply chain to \nprevent textile waste. Those steps outline business, consumer \nand policy options following the idea of a circular economy. \nOverall, textile waste can be prevented effectively by following \nthe guiding principle of 'reduce by design', which is applied at \nthe earliest stages of the value chain with the aim of reducing \nthe number of materials, chemicals and waste. Additionally, \nretention loops, once implemented along the supply chain, \ncan ensure the use of clothing to its maximum, guaranteeing \nextensive textile waste prevention. This could, for instance, take \nplace through a shift in business models, informed consumers \nand transparent and traceable value chains.\n\n3.6 Challenges and potentials for textile waste \nprevention in the EU\n\nAlongside the value chain, there are different types of measures \nthat have the potential to prevent the generation of textile \nwaste by extending lifespans. A significant volume is assumed \nto be prevented by repair and reuse activities, which can be \nachieved through eco-design, collaborative consumption \nmodels, promoting emotional attachment to clothing and more.\n\nAs the actual quantity of textile waste generated remains \nwidely unknown, quantitative assessments of the potential for \nprevention potentials have not been made so far. Estimates, \nhowever, have been made based on consumers' consumption \n\nBox 3.7 The French extended producer responsibility scheme\n\nThe French extended producer responsibility scheme for clothing, footwear and home textiles purchased by households \nwas introduced in 2007. Since then, companies that produce or import clothing, footwear or home textiles into French \nmarket have been held responsible for the collection, reuse and recycling of their products at the end-of-life stage.\n\nUnder this regulation, producers can either organise their own collection, reuse and recycling system or contribute to \nan accredited producer responsibility organisation (PRO), which will carry out these activities. So far, EcoTLC has been \nthe only accredited PRO in the area of textiles operating under a mandate that is negotiated with the government every \n6\u00a0years.\tSince\tthen,\tcompanies\tthat\tproduce\tor\timport\tclothing,\tfootwear\tor\thome\ttextiles\tinto\tthe\tFrench\tmarket\tare\t\nheld responsible for the product at every stage of its life cycle, from eco-design, to the collection, reuse and recycling of \ntheir\tproducts\tat\tthe\tend-of-life-stage.\tThe\tmandate\tuntil\tthe\tend\tof\t2019\tincluded\ttargets\tof\t50\u00a0%\tof\ttextiles\tand\tfootwear\t\nplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\tto\tbe\tdiverted\tfrom\tresidual\twaste\tstreams\tby\t2019,\twith\tat\tleast\t95\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttextiles\tand\tfootwear\t\ncollected\tgoing\tfor\treuse,\trecycling\tor\tsolid\trecovered\tfuel\tand\tno\tmore\tthan\t2\u00a0%\tgoing\tto\tlandfill.\tIn\tDecember\t2019,\t\nEco\u00a0TLC\t(now\tcalled\tRefashion)\twas\tgiven\ta\tmandate\tuntil\t31\u00a0December\t2022.\n\nand use behaviour or through surveys of unused clothing in \nhouseholds. WRAP, following a household study on clothing, \ncame\tto\tthe\tconclusion\tthat\t30\u00a0%\tof\tclothing\tin\tthe\taverage\t\nwardrobe has not been worn for at least a year, mostly because \nit no longer fits (WRAP, 2012). This reflects the volume of clothes \nthat could be prevented from being thrown out if versatility \nwere considered in product design, for instance. As the average \nhousehold\twardrobe\tis\tworth\taround\tEUR\u00a04\u00a0400,\tthe\taverage\t\nconsumer\tcould\tsave\taround\tEUR\u00a01\u00a0320\tover\ttheir\twardrobe's\t\nlifetime by overcoming this inefficiency. The study further \nestimates that extending the active use of clothes for 9 months \nwould\tsave\tabout\tEUR\u00a05.5\tbillion\tof\tresources\tused\tin\tthe\t\nsupply, laundering and and disposal of clothing. An extension \nof the average life of clothes by 3 months per item would lead \nto\ta\treduction\tof\tabout\t5-10\u00a0%\tin\teach\tof\tthe\tcarbon,\twater\tand\t\nwaste footprint. According to a study by McKinsey, in which the \neconomics of emission abatement within the fashion sector is \nillustrated, increasing the repairability of clothing would have \nthe potential to extend the average use of clothing by 1 year \n(approximately\t35\u00a0%)\tand\treduce\tthe\toverproduction\tof\tthe\t\nclothing\tindustry\tfrom\t20\u00a0%\tto\t10\u00a0%\t(McKinsey,\t2020).\n\nOne key challenge remains the collection system. Between \n1.6\u00a0and\t2.5\tmillion\ttonnes\tof\ttextiles\tare\tcollected\tout\tof\tthe\t\n5.2\u00a0million\ttonnes\tplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\t(JRC,\t2021).\tThe\tCouncil\t\nfor\tTextile\tRecycling\tindicates\tthat\tall\tbut\t5\u00a0%\tof\ttextile\twaste\t\ncould be put to alternative uses if not disposed of in household \nwaste. Hence, the obligation for Member States to implement a \nsystem of separate textile collection has considerable potential \nto eliminate textile waste from landfilling. However, increased \nwaste collection does not necessarily lead to an equivalent \nincrease in reuse. It might be argued that good-quality textiles \nalready find their way to reuse currently, while lower quality \ntextiles are thrown away. Therefore, an increased collection rate \nwould make more textiles available for recycling, but maybe not \nas much for reuse.\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n47Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nFigure 3.5 Textile waste prevention measures along the value chain, involving economic, political and \nsocietal innovations. \n\nRE\nU\n\nSE\n, R\n\nEP\n\nAIR, LONGER USE, SHARED U\nSE\n\nWASTE\n\nECO-DESIGN\n\nPRODUCTION\nAND DISTRIBUTION\n\nCONSUMPTION\nAND STOCK\n\nSynthetic fibres\nN\n\natural fibres\n\nChemical recycling\n\nMechanical recycling\n\nCircular textiles awareness\n\nSustainable productions\nand product policies.\nTax on resource use\n\nand environmental report\n\nR&D support\nInvestment support\nfor SMEs\n\nStartup and SME\ninvestment funding\nand support\n\nPurchase less\nfrequently/timeless\nitems rather than \nseasonal fashion clothes\n\nMindshift from\nowning to sharing\n\nPromoting longer\nuse\n\nPromoting reuse\n\nMaintenace \nguidelines\n\nGreen public\nprocurement\n\nReduced VAT\non sharing\n\nReduced VAT on \nrepair\nLabour subsidies\n\nReuse targets\nReduced VAT on \nsecond hand\n\nCompetition support\nto secondhand\nstores\n\nExtended producer\nresponsibility\n\nSeparated collection\nobligations\n\nRecycling and recycled\ncontent targets\n\nQuality requirements\nfor recycled fibres\n\nClear end-of-waste criteria\nInvestment funding and\nsupport\n\nTaxes and bans on incineration\nand landfill\n\nWaste prevention\ncampaigns\n\nRevaluing handicraft\nDemand for recycled\nfibres and products\n\nWaste separation and\ncollection campaigns\n\nElimination of \nincineration \nand landfill\n\nDigitalisation and\nonline platforms\n\nDesign for longevity\n\nEco design guidelines\n\nDurability standards\n\nPersonalisation\n\nPro-sumerism\n\nSafe by design\n\nPhasing out of \nchemicals of concern\n\nDurability\nlabelling\n\nSusatainability\nin designer eduction\n\nDesign \nfor durability\nand longevity\n\nDesign \nknowledge\n\nhubs\n\nUse of recycled fibres\n\nSustainable sourcing labelling\n\nResource taxes\non new fibres\n\nDemand for\nsustainable fibres\n\nQuality and safety\nrequirements\n\nResearch on \nsafe substitute\n\nmaterials\n\nDurable fibre mix\n\nSustainability in\nmaterials engineering\n\neduction\n\nBinding minimum\nstandards and \n\ncomplementary voluntary\ntargets\n\nEnhanced traceability\nReuse of fabric\nUpcycling\nYarn respinning\n\nResource\nefficient \nproduction Renting and \n\nleasing services\nSharing platforms\n\nDurable products\n\nLegal support\n\nMaintenance \nservices\n\nRepair services\n\nTake back and \nresale\nReuse stores\nand platforms\n\nCollection schemes\nManual and \nautomated sorting\n\nLocal production\nProduction on demand\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nECO DESIGN SHARED USE\n\nREUSE AS PRODUCT\n\nLONGER USE\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nREUSE AS MATERIAL\n\nSAFE AND CLEAN MATERIALS\n\nSUSTAINABLE FIBRE PRODUCTION\n\nWASTE PREVENTION\n\nRepair skills \nand DIY\n\nEducation and behavioural change Policy options Circular business models\n\nSource: Based on EEA (2019).\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n48 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nFurthermore, the complexity of drivers in combination with \nglobalised production chains makes measures specifically \nchallenging to address. Global production chains often lead to \ncommunication gaps between producers and designers, making \nthe implementation of design-for-prevention ideas harder. \nThe complexity of supply chains also makes the exchange \nof information and data difficult, leading to poor traceability \nof\u00a0products.\n\nA crucial point in this regard is the lack of available data. More \ncomprehensive data sets would enable the creation of a robust \nevidence base and accelerate the implementation of indicators \nand targets. A number of indicators that could be used to \nmeasure textile waste prevention (when data are given) have \nbeen proposed by the Nordic Council (see Table 3.2). While \ndata on household expenditure on textile products are widely \navailable, data on the actual textile waste generated will most \nprobably only be accessible after 2025, following the national \nimplementation of the mandatory separate collection of \ntextile\u00a0waste.\n\n3.7 Conclusions and future prospects\n\n3.7.1 Key findings and policy options\n\nThe EU-27 plays a significant role in the textile industry. It \ninvolves large trade volumes and is counted the second largest \nexporter of textiles and clothing worldwide, after China. \nThe expenditure on clothing and home textiles of European \nhouseholds increased over the past two decades, while its \nshare in total household expenditure decreased; this, coupled \nwith increasing numbers of clothing items put on the market, \nindicates a fall in the price of garments. These low price levels \nare the result of the fast fashion industry producing low-quality \nitems very quickly. This and many other drivers of textile \nwaste have been identified in this study. The drivers of textile \nwaste are, however, closely linked to the opportunities for and \n\nTable 3.2 Proposed textile waste prevention indicators\n\nIndicator Unit\n\nTextile waste generation kg/capita/year\n\nNew textile products put on the market by weight kg/capita/year\n\nPurchase of second-hand textile products by weight kg/capita/year\n\nHousehold expenditure on textile products value/capita/year\n\nShare of second-hand products in total textile products put on the market (weight or value basis) %\n\nRatio (by weight) of exported second-hand products to total textile products put on the \ndomestic\u00a0market %\n\nHousehold expenditure on textile products per tonne of textile products put on the market value/tonne\n\nRepaired textile products number/capita/year\n\nSource: Based on Watson et al. (2013).\n\nbarriers to its prevention. Textile waste prevention is expected \nto overcome inherent fast fashion models, consumption \npatterns, established value chains and economic barriers. \nFor instance, it has been shown that the demand for fast \nfashion can be narrowed down to a specific age group, which \ndemonstrates which audience the awareness-raising campaigns \ncould be tailored to (WRAP, 2019). However, the complex and \nhighly globalised value chain and the lack of data on textile \nwaste remain the key challenges.\n\nThe assessment conducted in the context of this report mapped \nthe measures, indicators and targets addressing textile waste \nprevention within national waste prevention programmes. \nThe assessment revealed about 40 measures that specifically \naddress textile waste in Europe. By mapping the indicators \nand targets for textile waste prevention, a serious lack of such \nindicators and targets has been identified, which could drive \nfurther policy development in this emerging field towards \npreventing waste. The drivers of textile waste identified can, \nfor instance, be addressed through technical, social and policy \nframeworks, such as the Dutch circular textile programme \n2020-2025 or the Swedish VAT regulation on repair.\n\nBased on the analysis of waste prevention drivers and the \nmapping of existing measures, the following policy options exist \nfor reducing textile waste:\n\n\u2022 regulatory incentives enforcing durability standards \nand circular design requirements or the banning of \nunsold\u00a0goods;\n\n\u2022 stricter regulations for chemicals within the textile \nindustry increasing the longevity of textiles;\n\n\u2022 promotion of research and innovation to develop \ndurable and circular textiles and technological innovations \n(e.g. digital product passport for clothing; see example in \nBox 3.8);\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n49Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n\u2022 promotion of collaboration and exchange platforms \nbetween key stakeholders along the supply chain;\n\n\u2022 supporting actions for techno-infrastructural \ndevelopments for both collaborative business models and \nclosed material loops;\n\n\u2022 producer awareness campaigns on durability, repair \nand reuse (e.g. implementing repairability of clothing into \nproduct policy or establishing take-back systems);\n\n\u2022 establishment of an EPR scheme, potentially harmonised \nat EU level, placing responsibility on producers for their \nproducts from their conception to their end-of-life phase, \nwhile setting an incentive for eco-design and reducing the \ncost of waste generated;\n\n\u2022 economic incentives for consumers to use repair services \n(e.g. tax breaks) and green public procurement;\n\n\u2022 clothing label and certification programmes addressing \nlongevity of textiles and/or including the aspect of longevity \nin existing labels and certifications; \n\n\u2022 information for consumers about the environmental \nimpacts of their textiles through harmonised methods such \nas the EU's product environmental footprint;\n\n\u2022 cooperation among countries towards finding a common \nmethodology and a format for reporting textile waste \ncollection and reuse capacities.\n\n3.7.2 Future prospects\n\nRegarding the future development of the textile industry, the \nJoint Research Centre (JRC) developed a vision statement that, \nby 2025, the textiles and clothing industry would be a strategic \nEU industry sector providing innovative products that enable \nservices to be integrated and that the industry would operate \naccording to a circular economic model (Bontoux et al., 2017).\n\nThe current linear textile value chain, however, is vulnerable to \nunpredictable events. Its lack of resilience was clear during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, when consumer demand collapsed and \nthere were shortages of raw materials. This exacerbated the \nexisting social and environmental issues of the textile industry. \nThe difficulties related to the COVID-19 outbreak highlighted \nonce more the importance of transforming the textile value \nchain into a more resilient and environmentally friendly \nindustry. The implementation of circular economy principles in \nthe textile industry is a key future approach and requires the \nengagement of stakeholders at all stages along the value chain.\n\nTo achieve circularity of textiles (and meet the JRC's vision by \n2025) and, particularly, to foster textile waste prevention, will \n\nrequire policy, economic and societal stakeholders to join \nforces. The steps that can be undertaken within each group \nare outlined in Figure 3.5, involving collaborative business \nmodels at the business level, the promotion of longer use \nand reuse at the policy level or a change in consumption \nhabits at the societal level. The slow fashion trend, which \nstrives to slow down the consumption and production \nprocesses within the textile industry, already induces \nfashion brands to establish new business models (see \nFigure 3.5) and consumers to purchase clothes wisely and \nless often (ETC/WMGE, 2019). A comprehensive transition \ntowards a successful waste prevention, however, can \nonly be achieved when distinct policy measures are put in \nplace\u00a0too.\n\nOverall, the focus on waste prevention efforts in the \ntextile sector is currently rather low across Europe. A more \nsystematic approach in waste prevention policymaking is \nneeded, with concrete targets, supportive measures, and \nrobust data collection and exchange among the different \nstakeholders. However, the increasing importance of \nthe textile sector in EU policymaking is expected to drive \nchange at the national level in Europe, and the next \nversions of national waste prevention programmes are \nvery likely to focus on textile waste. The forthcoming EU \ntextile strategy, for instance, envisages proposing actions \nthat enable bringing the textile industry into the concept \nof the circular economy. It ought to consider sustainable \nproduction and lifestyles, the use of chemicals, future \ntextile waste collection and recycling in the EU Member \nStates and it furthermore seeks to address these through \nreuse and recycling targets (European Commission, 2021a). \nThese efforts will be accompanied by the forthcoming \nsustainable products initiative, which seeks to propose the \nnecessary changes in the EU legal framework (European \nCommission, 2021b).\n\nBox 3.8  Digital infrastructure for textiles in \nEstonia\n\nTEXRoad is developing a sector-specific interoperable \ndigital infrastructure. This will enable the distribution \nof fundamental textile data to key stakeholders (the \npublic sector, industry and academia). According to \nthe study 'Post-consumer textile circularity in the Baltic \ncountries',\tabout\t73\u00a0%\tof\tmaterials\tgoing\tinto\tthe\tglobal\t\nclothing system ends up in landfill being incinerated. \nTEXroad wants to change that, as a large part of these \ntextiles is still usable and could be reused, and another \ngood proportion of the textiles could be recycled into \nnew products.

audience Citizens, economy\n\nType of measure Economic, voluntary, informative\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nOngoing\n\nShort description The repair guide 'Austria's clever repair search' offers citizens the opportunity to quickly \nand reliably find online a repair option for a used product in the area (either with a \nsuitable keyword or using the 12 different categories (e.g. clothing, electrical appliances, \nmachines and household appliances.). The list of companies found can then be narrowed \ndown geographically to individual districts. Every repair shop can register under certain \nrequirements free of charge at www.reparaturf\u00fchrer.at. The online platform is supported \nby the partners in the respective federal states and supported by the Ministry for Climate \nAction (BMK) and Austria Glas Recycling GmbH (ARA).\n\nIn addition, reference is made to the offer of a repair bonus. Federal states promote \nindividual repairs at regional companies. These repair subsidies are not an offer from the \nrepair guide, but were initiated and implemented directly by the federal states.\n\n2 Establishment of a stakeholder initiative with a focus on textiles and clothing\n\nTarget audience Administration, science, research and innovation, economy, non-governmental \norganisations (environmental and social)\n\nType of measure Voluntary, informative\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nOngoing\n\nShort description A stakeholder initiative with focus on textiles and clothing to exchange information/\nexperience and to promote circular economy and sustainable production was established. \nThe\tfirst\tdialogue\talready\ttook\tplace\ton\t15\u00a0October\t2021.\n\nThe aim of the first dialogue was to present current studies on textiles in the circular \neconomy, to discuss the scope for action and measures for the Austrian circular economy \nstrategy and to link up stakeholders along the entire value chain.\n\nFurthermore, there were very good experiences with previous stakeholder dialogues, which \nhave been carried out by BMK (Ministry for Climate Action) for several years in the area of \nwaste prevention (e.g. on food waste, reuse.)\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n61Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n3 Development of an Austrian circular economy strategy with a focus on textiles and clothing\n\nTarget audience Administration, science, research and innovation, economy, non-governmental \norganisations (environmental and social)\n\nType of measure Regulatory, economic, voluntary, informative, other\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nThe Austrian circular economy strategy should be available in 2022.\n\nShort description With the Green Deal and the new action plan for the circular economy, the EU Commission \nis also focusing on textiles and clothing. It is planning to develop a comprehensive EU \ntextile strategy with the aim of expanding the market for sustainable, environmentally \nfriendly, reusable and repairable textiles in Europe. Based on these EU requirements, \na circular economy strategy is also being developed in Austria, with a focus on textiles \nand clothing, among other things. The aim is to stimulate the transition to a sustainable, \nclimate-neutral, competitive, resource-efficient, circular textile economy and society. \nTherefore, the Federal Ministry for Climate Protection has conducted a study on incentives \nfor a sustainable and circular textile economy in Austria. The goal of this study is to obtain \nsuggestions on how supply and demand for environmentally friendly, circular and durable \ntextiles can be increased, sustainable production and behaviour patterns can be stimulated \nas well as a survey and estimation of the public procurement volume for textiles. The \nresults of the study provide input for the development of the textile focus and show the \nprocurement volume for textiles by public stakeholders in Austria, estimated at up to \nEUR\u00a0560\tmillion\tannually.\t\n\nThe goals of the transformation focus 'textiles and clothing' are:\n\n\u2022 extending the life and useful life of textiles;\n\n\u2022 promotion of circular business models;\n\n\u2022 increasing the collection, sorting and recycling of textiles.\n\nA2.2 Bulgaria\n\n1 Separate collection of second-hand clothes and textile waste from households\n\nTarget audience Households, municipalities\n\nType of measure Voluntary\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 2016\n\nShort description Several different private companies engaged in the import, sorting and pre-treatment of \nsecond-hand clothes and textile waste operate the separate collection systems for textiles \nintended for households.\n\nThese systems are on a voluntary basis after concluding contracts with municipalities. \nAt\u00a0present,\tthe\tmain\tmunicipalities\tin\tthe\tcountry\tare\tcovered,\tbut\tthere\tare\tno\tparticular\t\nrequirements and parameters of the systems. Separate collection is organised through \ntraditional kerbside containers for textile. The collected second-hand clothes and textile \nwastes are sold on the Bulgarian or foreign market by the companies themselves. Some of \nthe containers serve on behalf of the Bulgarian Red Cross (BRC). Of these, the second-hand \nclothes suitable for use are directed to the BRC crisis reserve or for donation to people \nin\u00a0need.\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n62 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nA2.3 Croatia\n\n1\t Social\tCollective\tHumana\tNova\t\u2014\tReuse\tof\twaste\u00a0textiles\n\nTarget audience Local community\n\nType of measure Economic\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\n1/5/2020-31/12/2020\n\nShort description The project aim was to collect and treat as much textile material as possible and repurpose \nit to make reusable textiles for industry in the form of industrial cloths with an indication \nof reuse.

During the project 1 tonne of textile was collected, out of which \n1000 protective masks and 300 bags were made.\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n63Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nA2.4 Cyprus\n\n1 Anakyklos Perivalontiki\n\nTarget audience Cyprus residents\n\nType of measure Voluntary/economic\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 2014\n\nShort description Anakyklos Perivalontiki operates as a green and social enterprise/company, focusing on \nthe collection and recycling of clothing, general fabric and fabric-related material. Though \nits primary goal is environmental sustainability through the recycling of clothes, fabrics, \ntextiles, etc., it also has broader environmental and social aims. The company is funded \nfrom private savings and personal loans, undertaken by five volunteers, its initial members.\nThe business employs 35 people in total, mainly from vulnerable groups (long-term \nunemployed). The revenues derives from:\n\n1. the sale of second-hand clothes in its four charity shops located in Cyprus' four main \ndistricts; and\n\n2. from the export of fabric and material to be resold or recycled and used as raw \nmaterial\u00a0abroad.\n\nThe project started initially with six collection banks/points in three municipalities and now \nthere are 415 collection points, covering the whole of Cyprus through 30 municipalities and \n125\tcommunities,\tcollecting\tso\tfar\tover\t6\u00a0000\ttonnes\tof\ttextiles.\n\nAs to its environmental actions, it has thus far led 126 activities for schools and 160 for the \nbroader public.\n\nAs to the societal activities of the business (i.e. offering free-of-charge clothes/fabric-related \nmaterial\tto\tthe\teconomically\tdisadvantaged)\tthese\taccount\tfor\t2\u00a0335\tpeople,\tin\ta\tpopulation\t\nof\t750\u00a0000,\tnot\tcounting\thome\tdeliveries\tand\tinstitutions.\tPerforms\tactions\tsuch\tas:\n\n\u2022 Sorting and offering free clothes to hundreds of people who need them, at the \nAnakyklos\u00a0stores.\n\n\u2022 Collection of clothes from dozens of social organisations and offer thousands of euros \nto buy food for people in need, covering expenses and providing breakfast for poor \nstudents and/or to support the social work of the organisations.\n\n\u2022 Offering some quantities of clothes to Cyprus Red Cross. \n\nA2.5 Czechia\n\n1 Municipal reuse centres\n\nTarget audience Public, citizens\n\nType of measure Regulatory, economic\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 01/01/2021 (unlimited)\n\nShort description Czechia supports the establishment of municipal reuse centres where citizens may bring \nthings for reuse. Things for reuse may also include clothes, footwear and household \ntextiles (e.g. Linens, blankets). Establishment of municipal reuse centres is supported \nthrough EU structural funds \u2014 Operational Programme Environment. Also from 1 January \n2021, the new Act on Waste came into force, which specifically states that a movable thing, \nwhich a person handed over to a location designated by a municipality and which can be \nused for its original purpose, in accordance with other legal regulations, has not become \nwaste, provided it has been handed over for reuse. \n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n64 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nA2.6 Finland\n\n1 Now, let's talk about textiles \u2014 Series of videos and blogs about textiles\n\nTarget audience Citizens\n\nType of measure Informative\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 2018\n\nShort description The campaign, implemented during 2018, aimed to bring the broad theme of the textile \ncircular economy to the attention of a wider audience. The aim was to promote a change \nin attitudes towards the consumption and recycling of textiles and to increase the value \nof textile products. The aim was to clarify for consumers the concept of waste textiles, \nrecycling and the possibilities for further processing. The presentation of the stakeholders \ninvolved in the different stages of the textile cycle and the broad base of cooperation was \nalso seen as a key message. The series was designed together between the Southwest \nFinland Waste Management, Turku University of Applied Sciences and Wallonia and was \nmade as part of the Telaketju pilot project funded by the Ministry of the Environment. The \nname of the blog and video series was chosen to be 'Now let's talk about textiles!'

The \nassignment should be carried out in cooperation with the Swedish Consumer Agency and the \nSwedish Chemicals Agency and the commission should include consumers' knowledge of the \nenvironmental and health impacts of textiles at every step of the value chain. \n\nInitially, an analysis of the current situation was carried out with the aim of identifying \nconsumers' knowledge of the environmental and health impact related to textiles and how \nconsumers act today, how they want and can act to reduce their environmental impact \nfrom the consumption of textiles. It also aimed to monitor the impact of the efforts over \ntime and to identify possible partners for cooperation.\n\nIn order to reach out broadly to selected target groups, the campaign's information \ninitiatives were divided into four tracks:\n\n1. low-intensity and long-term direct communication with consumers in their own digital \nchannels, via advertising and intermediary providers of information in digital channels;\n\n2. direct communication with consumers through targeted communication initiatives at \nselected areas, events and media initiatives ;\n\n3. development of information material and cooperation with stakeholders like \nmunicipalities, county administrative boards and regions ;\n\n4. collaboration with the industry to enable consumers to make more sustainable choices \nand to provide consumers with better information at the time of purchase.\n\nA joint visual identity, communication plan and a campaign name were developed to give \nthe three authorities a common voice. The information campaign was named Textilsmart. \nTwo primary information channels were set up for direct communication and ongoing \nadvertising to consumers: an Instagram account for concise, easily accessible facts and \nopportunities for dialogue, and a campaign site under Hall\u00e5 konsument where consumers \ncould find more detailed information. In addition, Textilsmart has implemented targeted \ncommunication initiatives and collaborations with stakeholders such as municipalities, \ncounty administrative boards and regions as well as with the industry to reach out and \nmeet consumers in their everyday lives.\n\nThree authorities have cooperated in the implementation of the information campaign \nTextilsmart. The campaign has also included collaborations with a variety of stakeholders \nto reach out widely to consumers in different arenas. A far-reaching cooperation has been \ncarried out with the National F/ACT Movement project to promote more sustainable textile \nconsumption. The collaboration between the Textilsmart campaign and the National  \nF/ACT Movement has involved joint press releases, Instagram posts and that the participating \nof f/activists (individuals who during the project period received training and creative \nchallenges in exchange for refraining from new consumption), shared Textilsmart's messages \nand materials and used #textilsmart in their own social media posts.

They are in the clothes we wear, the towels we use and the bed sheets we sleep in. They are in the carpets, curtains and cushions we decorate our homes and offices with. And they are in safety belts, and car tyres, workwear and sportswear. Synthetic textile fibres are produced from fossil fuel resources, such as oil and natural gas. Their production, consumption and related waste handling generate greenhouse gas emissions, use non-renewable resources and can release microplastics. This briefing provides an overview of the synthetic textile economy in Europe, analyses environmental and climate impacts, and highlights the potential for developing a circular economy value chain.\nAn underpinning report on \"Plastic in textiles: potentials for circularity and reduced environmental and climate impacts\" by the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE) is available.\nSince the late 1990s, polyester has surpassed cotton as the fibre most commonly used in textiles.\nThe global consumption of synthetic fibres increased from a few thousand tonnes in 1940 to more than 60 million tonnes in 2018, and it continues to rise. Since the late 1990s, polyester has surpassed cotton as the fibre most commonly used in textiles. While the majority of synthetic textile fibres are produced in Asia, Europe stands out as the world\u2019s largest importer of synthetic fibres by trade value (Birkbeck, 2020), and also produces and exports such fibres.\nEstimates of textile consumption per person in Europe are uncertain, ranging from 9 to 27 kg per person (Beton, et al., 2014; Watson, et al., 2018; ETC/WMGE, et al., 2019; \u0160ajn, 2019). It is estimated that, in 2017, European households consumed about 13 million tonnes of textile products (clothing, footwear and household textiles) (Stadler, et al., 2018).\nOver 70 % of synthetic textile fibres are processed into clothing and household textiles. The remainder is used for technical textiles (e.g. safety wear) and industrial uses (e.g. vehicles and machinery) (Ryberg, et al., 2017). Synthetic fibres are cheap and versatile, enabling the production of cheap, fast fashion and high-performance textiles for durable clothing.\nThe EU production of synthetic fibres totalled 2.24 million tonnes in 2018: 1.78 million tonnes were imported, 0.36 million tonnes exported and 3.66 million tonnes consumed (Figure 1).\nSource: Based on Eurostat and ETC/WMGE data.\nNote: Synthetic fibers and yarns are a subset of PRODCOM product groups 13.10 and 20.60\nAt a global level, the production of synthetic fibres currently consumes approximately 1 % of crude oil production (48 million tonnes per year) (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017; EIA, 2020), and is expected to increase.\nProduction and use of bio-based synthetic fibres is currently negligible (European Bioplastics 2020).\nMore than half of the global fibre production is polyester, making it the most common synthetic fibre (55 million tonnes in 2018) (Textile Exchange, 2019). Polyester is a strong fibre and produced at a low price. It is used in a multitude of applications. Clothing accounts for a large share of its use, as a cheaper and thinner alternative to cotton. After polyester, nylon is the most common synthetic fibre. It is a strong fibre that is widely used in tights, carpets and umbrellas. In 2018, over 5 million tonnes of nylon fibre was produced (Textile Exchange, 2019).\nIt is estimated that EU consumers discard about 5.8 million tonnes of textiles annually \u2014 about 11 kg per person \u2013 of which roughly two thirds are synthetic (Beasley, and Georgeson, 2014).\nIn Europe, about one third of textile waste is collected separately, and a large part is exported for reuse or recycling abroad. While percentages vary between countries, about 60-70 % of all collected textiles are reused (locally or abroad), 10-30 % are recycled and 10-20 % are incinerated for energy recovery or landfilled (Watson, et al., 2020). Textiles that are not separately collected end up in mixed waste. Globally, it is estimated that only 0.06 % of all textile waste (typically cotton-rich products) is recycled into fibres for use in new textile products (Textile Exchange, 2020). Recycling of synthetic fibres is not observed at scale.An estimated 42 million tonnes of plastic textile waste was generated globally in 2015. This accounts for 13 % of all plastic waste, making textiles the third largest contributor to plastic waste generation (Geyer, et al., 2017). The total amount of textile waste generated annually in the EU is unknown.\nThe production and consumption of textiles generate environmental pressures and impacts such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; air and water pollution; land, water and other resource use; and impacts related to the use of chemicals. The range of impacts depends on the fibre type (ETC/WMGE, et al., 2019).\nThe production of synthetic fibres requires large amounts of energy and is a significant contributor to climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel resources.\nThe production of synthetic fibres requires large amounts of energy and is a significant contributor to climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, in contrast to cotton \u2014 the most common natural fibre \u2014 producing synthetic fibres does not require agricultural resources or the use of toxic pesticides or fertilisers (Sandin, et al., 2019).\nThus, if a comparative assessment of overall impact on the environment and climate is extended beyond resource depletion and GHG emissions to include land use, water use and ecosystem impacts, it is not possible to make a straightforward comparison of different fibre types in terms of their overall environmental performance (Beton, et al., 2014). Different fibres clearly have different environmental and climate impacts, so which textile is deemed more advantageous depends on which impact one focuses on. Figure 2 below provides an overview of the environmental and climate impacts of textiles.\nThe specific relative environmental and climate impacts of the most common synthetic fibres and cotton can be compared, per kilogram of dyed, woven fabric, as shown in Figure 3. The synthetic fibre nylon has the highest impact per kilogram for climate change and fossil fuel use. For land use, water use, eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity, cotton has the highest impact per kilogram. A similar comparison can be made between polyester and cotton: the full life cycle of 1 kg of polyester fabric is estimated to be responsible for the release of more than 30 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent, while only around 20 kg are associated with cotton (Beton, et al., 2014).\nIt is important to keep in mind that impacts also depend on the production volumes of the fibres and fabrics. For example, while the manufacturing of polyester uses less energy than nylon, its annual production rate is much higher resulting in higher overall impacts.\nEnvironmental effects are not only generated during the production of textiles. During use, the main environmental impacts are generated by domestic and/or industrial washing, drying and ironing. While these caretaking activities require a lot of energy and contribute to climate change, they also enable longer and more intensive product use, adding to the product\u2019s lifespan.\nThe importance of considering the entire life cycle becomes obvious when looking at the example of microplastics shed from synthetic textiles throughout their lifespan. Microplastics are a fairly recent issue of concern. They are a new topic of research and not included in typical life cycle analysis. Much is still to be learned about the magnitude of their impact on human health and the environment.\nIt is estimated that between 200 000 and 500 000 tonnes of microplastic fibres from textiles enter the marine environment each year (Sherrington, 2016; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).\nMicroplastics are shed from synthetic textiles throughout their life cycles: from fibre and fabric manufacturing, through use and washing to their final disposal, whether by landfilling, incineration or recycling. It is estimated that between 200 000 and 500 000 tonnes of microplastic fibres from textiles enter the marine environment each year (Sherrington, 2016; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).\nIn the 2020 circular economy action plan, the European Commission identified textiles as a priority product category with significant potential for circularity.\nIn the 2020 circular economy action plan, the European Commission identified textiles as a priority product category with significant potential for circularity. The action plan recognises that \u2018textiles are the fourth highest pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water, after food, housing and transport, and the fifth for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 (EEA, 2019; EC, 2020b). The action plan envisages a comprehensive EU strategy for textiles aiming to \u2018strengthen industrial competitiveness and innovation in the sector, boosting the EU market for sustainable and circular textiles, including the market for textile reuse, addressing fast fashion and driving new business models\u2019. In 2019, the first Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for textile products (T-shirts) were developed (Elsen, et al., 2019; Pesnel, and Payet, 2019).\nIn line with the 2020 circular economy action plan, this EEA briefing and its underpinning ETC/WMGE report highlight some pathways to make synthetic textile production and consumption more circular and sustainable. These are sustainable fibre choices, control of microplastic emissions and improved separate collection, reuse and recycling.\nSustainable fibre choices: the choice of fibres not only defines textile product properties and performance but also determines the environmental impact of the resulting product and will influence the fate of synthetic textiles throughout the rest of their life cycles. While a shift to natural or bio-based fibres may reduce the impacts from the use of fossil fuel resources and greenhouse gas emissions, these fibres do not always have equivalent properties and are not necessarily more sustainable over the entire life cycle. The guiding principle is that the choice of fibre should match the textile product\u2019s application, the properties required, and the expected lifespan and end-of-life processes. At the design stage, important choices are made on the fibre types to be used for a particular product or application. The importance of fit-for-purpose fibre selection implies that there is no use in ruling out certain fibre types \u2014 e.g. synthetic ones \u2014 and that there is no go-to fibre type that by itself constitutes a sustainable textiles industry.\nControl of microplastic emissions: several initiatives have been set up to study the factors that influence microplastic emissions \u2014 including those from synthetic textiles \u2014 and assess their effect on human health and the environment. At the same time, many strategies, such as adapted textile construction and filters in washing machines, are being explored to reduce the emissions of microplastics to water and air during a textile\u2019s life cycle. In implementing the EU plastics strategy, efforts will not only focus on building the knowledge base related to the risk and the occurrence of microplastics in the environment, and improving and harmonising measuring methods, but also be targeted at increasing the capture of microplastics in practice, e.g. by filters(EC, 2020a).\nImproved separate collection, reuse and recycling: reuse and recycling are critical to reducing the demand for virgin fibres and achieving a circular economy. Fibre recycling is especially challenging in the case of synthetic textiles, for both technical and economic reasons. Improved separate textile collection, accurate automated sorting and high-quality textile reuse and recycling have significant potential to reduce environmental impacts. However, many technical, economic and social challenges will have to be overcome to facilitate and encourage reuse and make fibre-to-fibre recycling technically and economically viable. Under the EU Waste Framework Directive, separate collection of textile waste will be obligatory in all Member States by 1 January 2025. This calls for prior installation of sufficient sorting and recycling capacity.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has led to a sudden but rapid decrease in consumer demand for textiles and consequential cash-flow problems and unemployment in the textiles sector. There are risks that these factors could slow down the shift to a more circular and sustainable textiles sector.

Synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon,\nmake up about 60% of clothing and 70 % of household textiles.\n\nSynthetic textiles affect the environment and climate throughout their life cycle through\nresource use, and the emission of greenhouse gases and pollutants. In addition, between\n200 000 and 500 000 tonnes of microplastics from textiles enter the marine environment\neach year.\n\nIn contrast to cotton, the production of synthetic fibres does not use agricultural resources,\ntoxic pesticides or fertilisers.\n\nEU consumers discard about 5.8 million tonnes of textiles annually \ufffd around 11 kg per\nperson - of which about two thirds consist of synthetic fibres. In Europe, about one third of\ntextile waste is collected separately, and a large part is exported.\n\nPromoting sustainable fibre choices and control of microplastic emissions, and improving\nseparate collection, reuse and recycling, have the potential to improve the sustainability and\ncircularity of synthetic textiles in a circular economy.\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe2\n\nhttps://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-wmge/products/plastic-in-textiles-potentials-for-circularity-and-reduced-environmental-and-climate-impacts\f\nSince the late 1990s, polyester has surpassed cotton as the fibre most\ncommonly used in textiles.\n\nThe global consumption of synthetic fibres increased from a few thousand tonnes in 1940 to more\nthan 60 million tonnes in 2018, and it continues to rise. Since the late 1990s, polyester has surpassed\ncotton as the fibre most commonly used in textiles. While the majority of synthetic textile fibres are\nproduced in Asia, Europe stands out as the world\ufffds largest importer of synthetic fibres by trade value\n(Birkbeck, 2020), and also produces and exports such fibres.\n\nEstimates of textile consumption per person in Europe are uncertain, ranging from 9 to 27 kg per\nperson (Beton, et al., 2014; Watson, et al., 2018; ETC/WMGE, et al., 2019; \ufffdajn, 2019). It is\nestimated that, in 2017, European households consumed about 13 million tonnes of textile products\n(clothing, footwear and household textiles) (Stadler, et al., 2018). \n\nOver 70 % of synthetic textile fibres are processed into clothing and household textiles. The\nremainder is used for technical textiles (e.g. safety wear) and industrial uses (e.g. vehicles and\nmachinery) (Ryberg, et al., 2017). Synthetic fibres are cheap and versatile, enabling the production of\ncheap, fast fashion and high-performance textiles for durable clothing. \n\nThe EU production of synthetic fibres totalled 2.24 million tonnes in 2018: 1.78 million tonnes were\nimported, 0.36 million tonnes exported and 3.66 million tonnes consumed (Figure 1).\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe 3\n\f\nFigure 1. EU production, consumption and trade of synthetic fibers, 2018\n\n \n\nAt a global level, the production of synthetic fibres currently consumes\napproximately 1 % of crude oil production (48 million tonnes per year)\n(Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017; EIA, 2020), and is expected to\nincrease.\n\nProduction and use of bio-based synthetic fibres is currently negligible (European Bioplastics 2020). \n\n \n\nSource: Based on Eurostat and ETC/WMGE data.\nNote: Synthetic fibers and yarns are a subset of PRODCOM product groups 13.10 and\n20.60\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe4\n\f\nMore than half of the global fibre production is polyester, making it the most common synthetic fibre\n(55 million tonnes in 2018) (Textile Exchange, 2019). Polyester is a strong fibre and produced at a\nlow price. It is used in a multitude of applications. Clothing accounts for a large share of its use, as a\ncheaper and thinner alternative to cotton. After polyester, nylon is the most common synthetic fibre. It\nis a strong fibre that is widely used in tights, carpets and umbrellas. In 2018, over 5 million tonnes of\nnylon fibre was produced (Textile Exchange, 2019).\n\nIt is estimated that EU consumers discard about 5.8 million tonnes of\ntextiles annually \ufffd about 11 kg per person \ufffd of which roughly two thirds\nare synthetic  (Beasley, and Georgeson, 2014).\n\nIn Europe, about one third of textile waste is collected separately, and a large part is exported for\nreuse or recycling abroad. While percentages vary between countries, about 60-70 % of all collected\ntextiles are reused (locally or abroad), 10-30 % are recycled and 10-20 % are incinerated for energy\nrecovery or landfilled (Watson, et al., 2020). Textiles that are not separately collected end up in\nmixed waste. Globally, it is estimated that only 0.06 % of all textile waste (typically cotton-rich\nproducts) is recycled into fibres for use in new textile products (Textile Exchange, 2020). Recycling of\nsynthetic fibres is not observed at scale.An estimated 42 million tonnes of plastic textile waste was\ngenerated globally in 2015. This accounts for 13 % of all plastic waste, making textiles the third\nlargest contributor to plastic waste generation (Geyer, et al., 2017). The total amount of textile waste\ngenerated annually in the EU is unknown.  \n\nEnvironmental and climate impacts of synthetic fibres and\ntextiles\n\nThe production and consumption of textiles generate environmental pressures and impacts such as\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; air and water pollution; land, water and other resource use; and\nimpacts related to the use of chemicals. The range of impacts depends on the fibre type\n(ETC/WMGE, et al., 2019). \n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe 5\n\f\nThe production of synthetic fibres requires large amounts of energy and is\na significant contributor to climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel\nresources.\n\nThe production of synthetic fibres requires large amounts of energy and is a significant contributor to\nclimate change and the depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, in contrast to cotton \ufffd the most\ncommon natural fibre \ufffd producing synthetic fibres does not require agricultural resources or the use\nof toxic pesticides or fertilisers (Sandin, et al., 2019). \n\nThus, if a comparative assessment of overall impact on the environment and climate is extended\nbeyond resource depletion and GHG emissions to include land use, water use and ecosystem\nimpacts, it is not possible to make a straightforward comparison of different fibre types in terms of\ntheir overall environmental performance (Beton, et al., 2014). Different fibres clearly have different\nenvironmental and climate impacts, so which textile is deemed more advantageous depends on\nwhich impact one focuses on. Figure 2 below provides an overview of the environmental and climate\nimpacts of textiles.\n\nFigure 2. Environmental impacts across the life cycle of synthetic textiles\n\n \n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe6\n\f\n \n\nThe specific relative environmental and climate impacts of the most common synthetic fibres and\ncotton can be compared, per kilogram of dyed, woven fabric, as shown in Figure 3. The synthetic\nfibre nylon has the highest impact per kilogram for climate change and fossil fuel use. For land use,\nwater use, eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity, cotton has the highest impact per kilogram.\nA similar comparison can be made between polyester and cotton: the full life cycle of 1 kg of\npolyester fabric is estimated to be responsible for the release of more than 30 kg of carbon dioxide\nequivalent, while only around 20 kg are associated with cotton (Beton, et al., 2014). \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that impacts also depend on the production volumes of the fibres and\nfabrics. For example, while the manufacturing of polyester uses less energy than nylon, its annual\nproduction rate is much higher resulting in higher overall impacts.\n\nFigure 3. Comparison of the environmental impacts for the manufacturing of 1 kg of dyed,\nwoven fabric \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironmental effects are not only generated during the production of textiles. During use, the main\nenvironmental impacts are generated by domestic and/or industrial washing, drying and ironing.\nWhile these caretaking activities require a lot of energy and contribute to climate change, they also\nenable longer and more intensive product use, adding to the product\ufffds lifespan. \n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe 7\n\f\nThe importance of considering the entire life cycle becomes obvious when looking at the example of\nmicroplastics shed from synthetic textiles throughout their lifespan. Microplastics are a fairly recent\nissue of concern. They are a new topic of research and not included in typical life cycle analysis.\nMuch is still to be learned about the magnitude of their impact on human health and the\nenvironment. \n\nIt is estimated that between 200 000 and 500 000 tonnes of microplastic\nfibres from textiles enter the marine environment each year (Sherrington,\n2016; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).\n\nMicroplastics are shed from synthetic textiles throughout their life cycles: from fibre and fabric\nmanufacturing, through use and washing to their final disposal, whether by landfilling, incineration or\nrecycling. It is estimated that between 200 000 and 500 000 tonnes of microplastic fibres from textiles\nenter the marine environment each year (Sherrington, 2016; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).\n\nTowards a circular economy for synthetic fibres and textiles\n\nIn the 2020 circular economy action plan, the European Commission\nidentified textiles as a priority product category with significant\npotential for circularity.\n\nIn the 2020 circular economy action plan, the European Commission identified textiles as a priority\nproduct category with significant potential for circularity. The action plan recognises that \ufffdtextiles are\nthe fourth highest pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water, after food,\nhousing and transport, and the fifth for greenhouse gas emissions\ufffd (EEA, 2019; EC, 2020b). The\naction plan envisages a comprehensive EU strategy for textiles aiming to \ufffdstrengthen industrial\ncompetitiveness and innovation in the sector, boosting the EU market for sustainable and circular\ntextiles, including the market for textile reuse, addressing fast fashion and driving new business\nmodels\ufffd. In 2019, the first Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for textile\nproducts (T-shirts) were developed (Elsen, et al., 2019; Pesnel, and Payet, 2019). \n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe8\n\f\nIn line with the 2020 circular economy action plan, this EEA briefing and its underpinning ETC/WMGE\nreport highlight some pathways to make synthetic textile production and consumption more circular\nand sustainable. These are sustainable fibre choices, control of microplastic emissions and improved\nseparate collection, reuse and recycling.\n\n \n\nSustainable fibre choices: the choice of fibres not only defines textile\nproduct properties and performance but also determines the environmental\nimpact of the resulting product and will influence the fate of synthetic\ntextiles throughout the rest of their life cycles. While a shift to natural or biobased fibres may reduce the impacts from the use of fossil fuel resources\nand greenhouse gas emissions, these fibres do not always have equivalent\nproperties and are not necessarily more sustainable over the entire life\ncycle. The guiding principle is that the choice of fibre should match the\ntextile product\ufffds application, the properties required, and the expected\nlifespan and end-of-life processes. At the design stage, important choices\nare made on the fibre types to be used for a particular product or\napplication. The importance of fit-for-purpose fibre selection implies that\nthere is no use in ruling out certain fibre types \ufffd e.g. synthetic ones \ufffd and\nthat there is no go-to fibre type that by itself constitutes a sustainable\ntextiles industry. \n\nControl of microplastic emissions: several initiatives have been set up to\nstudy the factors that influence microplastic emissions \ufffd including those\nfrom synthetic textiles \ufffd and assess their effect on human health and the\nenvironment. At the same time, many strategies, such as adapted textile\nconstruction and filters in washing machines, are being explored to reduce\nthe emissions of microplastics to water and air during a textile\ufffds life cycle.\nIn implementing the EU plastics strategy, efforts will not only focus on\nbuilding the knowledge base related to the risk and the occurrence of\nmicroplastics in the environment, and improving and harmonising\nmeasuring methods, but also be targeted at increasing the capture of\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe 9\n\f\nmicroplastics in practice, e.g. by filters(EC, 2020a). \n\nImproved separate collection, reuse and recycling: reuse and recycling\nare critical to reducing the demand for virgin fibres and achieving a circular\neconomy. Fibre recycling is especially challenging in the case of synthetic\ntextiles, for both technical and economic reasons. Improved separate textile\ncollection, accurate automated sorting and high-quality textile reuse and\nrecycling have significant potential to reduce environmental impacts.\nHowever, many technical, economic and social challenges will have to be\novercome to facilitate and encourage reuse and make fibre-to-fibre\nrecycling technically and economically viable. Under the EU Waste\nFramework Directive, separate collection of textile waste will be obligatory\nin all Member States by 1 January 2025. This calls for prior installation of\nsufficient sorting and recycling capacity.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has led to a sudden but rapid decrease in consumer demand for textiles and\nconsequential cash-flow problems and unemployment in the textiles sector. There are risks that\nthese factors could slow down the shift to a more circular and sustainable textiles sector. At the same\ntime, the crisis demonstrates the fragility of the current way of working and offers the momentum to\nfundamentally change the textiles system towards greater circularity, with positive economic and\nenvironmental outcomes. \n\nTo achieve a circular and more sustainable textile system, while supporting economic recovery, a\nnumber of textile and clothing organisations have proposed a list of measures (Euratex, 2020; Policy\nHub, and Boston Consulting Group, 2020).\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nAdam, M., 2018, 'The role of human resource management (HRM) for the implementation of\nsustainable product-service systems (PSS) \ufffd an analysis of fashion retailers', Sustainability10(7), pp.\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Resource efficiency > Plastic in textiles: towards a circular economy for synthetic textiles in Europe10\n\f\n2518.\n\nBeasley, J. and Georgeson, R., 2014, Advancing resource efficiency in Europe.

The textiles industry employs millions of people worldwide, making it among the largest in the world and an important part of Europe\u2019s manufacturing industry. However, textile production and consumption cause significant environmental, climate and social impacts by using resources, water, land and chemicals and emitting greenhouse gases and pollutants. This briefing provides an EU perspective of the environmental and climate pressures from textile production and consumption, and discusses how circular business models and regulation can help move us towards a circular textiles economy.\nAn underpinning report of the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE) on textiles and the environment in a circular economy is available.\nThe textiles market is highly globalised, and millions of producers and billions of consumers across the world are involved in so-called linear value chains. These chains \u2014 from raw material extraction to production, transport, consumption and waste \u2014 include little or no reuse or recycling. Since 1975, the global production of textile fibres has almost tripled. Today, 60 % of textile fibres are synthetic.\nPolyester is the most commonly used fibre, produced from carbon-intensive processes requiring more than 70 million barrels of oil each year. The remaining fibres are mainly from cotton, which uses land and water. In 2014, the number of garments produced globally amounted to nearly 14 new items of clothing per person.\nIn the EU, there are around 171 000 companies in the textile (including wearing apparel) industry, employing 1.7 million people. In 2017, the EU produced 7.4 kg of textiles per person while consuming nearly 26 kg. The EU is therefore a net importer of textiles (mainly finished products from Asia).\nExports from the EU mainly comprise intermediate textile products, such as technical fibres and high-quality fabrics in which the European industry specialises (Figure 1).\nNote: The waste flow of textiles from stock is not included in this scheme.\nDetails: Import, export, production and consumption flows of textile products, EU-28, 2017\nBetween 1996 and 2018, clothing prices in the EU dropped by over 30 %, relative to inflation. Since 2000, Europeans have purchased more pieces of clothing but spent less money in doing so. Fast fashion \u2014 the rapid changing of clothing lines and fashion trends \u2014 promotes increased consumption and reduces the life span of clothing.\nEU consumers discard about 11 kg of textiles per person per year. The export of used clothes \u2014 mainly to eastern European countries, Asia and Africa \u2014 is significant and increasing. Used clothes not exported are mostly incinerated or landfilled. Textiles recycling is low.\nResource inputs, and the environmental and climate pressures from and impacts of the textiles system occur in every phase: from production of fibres and textile products to distribution and retail, use of textiles, collection, sorting and recycling, and final waste management. Pressures from and impacts of the textiles system, include the use of resources, land and chemicals, and the emission of greenhouse gases.\nRegarding total use of primary raw materials in the supply chain for consumption in the EU, clothing, footwear and household textiles represents the fourth highest pressure category after food, housing and transport (Figure 2). These textiles are also the fourth highest pressure category for water use.\nProducing and handling all clothing, footwear and household textiles purchased by EU-28 households in 2017 used an estimated 1.3 tonnes of primary raw materials and 104 m3 of water per person. Some 85 % of these primary materials and 92 % of the water were used in other regions of the world, which is highest of all consumption domains.\nRegarding pressures on land use from the upstream value chain for consumption in the EU, clothing, footwear and household textiles represent the second highest pressure category, following food consumed in the EU. The majority of pressures on land use come from outside the EU (93 %) and are largely a consequence of cotton cultivation.\nLooking at climate change pressures, the production of textiles generates around 15-35 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of textiles produced. The upstream value chain of clothing, footwear and household textiles consumed in the EU is the fifth highest greenhouse gas emission pressure category. Its contribution is higher than the following consumption categories (Figure 3):\nThe production and handling of clothing, footwear and household textiles consumed in the EU-28 generated emissions of 654 kg CO2 equivalent per person in 2017. Only 25 % of this took place inside the EU-28.\nTextile production processes make use of a large amount and variety of chemicals. About 3 500 substances are used in textile production. Of these, 750 have been classified as hazardous for human health and 440 as hazardous for the environment. It is estimated that about 20 % of global water pollution is caused by dyeing and finishing textile products, affecting the health of workers and local communities.\nWashing releases chemicals and microplastics into household waste water. It is estimated that about half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres are released into the ocean annually from washing plastic-based textiles.\nIn addition to the environmental and climate effects, the highly competitive, mostly linear business models in the sector \u2014 inside and outside Europe \u2014 can have detrimental social impacts. These include:\nAvoiding suppliers outside Europe that use child labour is still a challenge in some regions. In addition, industrial accidents, including fatalities, occur regularly.\nPrivate companies and public authorities are increasingly seeing the potential economic, social, environmental and climate benefits of a circular textiles system. Recently, circular business models focusing on circular textile design, sharing, recycling and reuse of textiles have surfaced. Such business models cannot be upscaled in isolation \u2014 it needs a change in the whole system supported by regulation and other policies.\nIn 2019, the European Commission identified textiles (apparel and fabrics) as a \u2018priority product category for the circular economy\u2019 in Sustainable products in a circular economy \u2014 Towards an EU product policy framework contributing to the circular economy. Furthermore, the new European Commission President announced in My agenda for Europe that she \u2018will propose a new circular economy action plan focusing on sustainable resource use, especially in resource intensive and high-impact sectors such as textiles and construction\u2019.\nEducation and behavioural change are an important part of the shift towards circular textiles to bring about behavioural change across the entire system \u2014 from production and processing to transport, consumption and waste.\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation describes a circular textiles system as one that is:\n\u2026restorative and regenerative by design and provides benefits for business, society and environment. A system in which clothes, fabrics and fibres are kept at their highest value during use, and re-enter the economy after use, never ending up as waste.\nThe EEA envisages the circular economy as one in which circularity is ensured in all phases of the lifecycle, including materials, eco-design, production and distribution, consumption and stock, and waste.

Circular business models need to be systematically scaled \u2013 and supported by policies - to enable sustainable sourcing of synthetic and natural fibres, including recycling and reuse of materials. When creating a circular economy for textiles, design choices are key. Safe and clean material cycles can be supported by:\nResource taxes on new fibres could potentially increase the demand for used fibres. A strong focus on sustainability in design education curricula would be a powerful spur for a change in design culture. Extended producer responsibility is an option already used in other sectors to make producers responsible for the materials used throughout their whole lifecycle.\nMainstream business models often rely on short production and consumption cycles and low-cost labour and materials, generating social and environmental impacts.

The textiles industry employs millions of people worldwide, making it among the largest in the world and an important part of Europe\u2019s manufacturing industry. However, textile production and consumption cause significant environmental, climate and social impacts by using resources, water, land and chemicals and emitting greenhouse gases and pollutants. This briefing provides an EU perspective of the environmental and climate pressures from textile production and consumption, and discusses how circular business models and regulation can help move us towards a circular textiles economy.\nAn underpinning report of the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE) on textiles and the environment in a circular economy is available.\nThe textiles market is highly globalised, and millions of producers and billions of consumers across the world are involved in so-called linear value chains. These chains \u2014 from raw material extraction to production, transport, consumption and waste \u2014 include little or no reuse or recycling. Since 1975, the global production of textile fibres has almost tripled. Today, 60 % of textile fibres are synthetic.\nPolyester is the most commonly used fibre, produced from carbon-intensive processes requiring more than 70 million barrels of oil each year. The remaining fibres are mainly from cotton, which uses land and water. In 2014, the number of garments produced globally amounted to nearly 14 new items of clothing per person.\nIn the EU, there are around 171 000 companies in the textile (including wearing apparel) industry, employing 1.7 million people. In 2017, the EU produced 7.4 kg of textiles per person while consuming nearly 26 kg. The EU is therefore a net importer of textiles (mainly finished products from Asia).\nExports from the EU mainly comprise intermediate textile products, such as technical fibres and high-quality fabrics in which the European industry specialises (Figure 1).\nNote: The waste flow of textiles from stock is not included in this scheme.\nDetails: Import, export, production and consumption flows of textile products, EU-28, 2017\nBetween 1996 and 2018, clothing prices in the EU dropped by over 30 %, relative to inflation. Since 2000, Europeans have purchased more pieces of clothing but spent less money in doing so. Fast fashion \u2014 the rapid changing of clothing lines and fashion trends \u2014 promotes increased consumption and reduces the life span of clothing.\nEU consumers discard about 11 kg of textiles per person per year. The export of used clothes \u2014 mainly to eastern European countries, Asia and Africa \u2014 is significant and increasing. Used clothes not exported are mostly incinerated or landfilled. Textiles recycling is low.\nResource inputs, and the environmental and climate pressures from and impacts of the textiles system occur in every phase: from production of fibres and textile products to distribution and retail, use of textiles, collection, sorting and recycling, and final waste management. Pressures from and impacts of the textiles system, include the use of resources, land and chemicals, and the emission of greenhouse gases.\nRegarding total use of primary raw materials in the supply chain for consumption in the EU, clothing, footwear and household textiles represents the fourth highest pressure category after food, housing and transport (Figure 2). These textiles are also the fourth highest pressure category for water use.\nProducing and handling all clothing, footwear and household textiles purchased by EU-28 households in 2017 used an estimated 1.3 tonnes of primary raw materials and 104 m3 of water per person. Some 85 % of these primary materials and 92 % of the water were used in other regions of the world, which is highest of all consumption domains.\nRegarding pressures on land use from the upstream value chain for consumption in the EU, clothing, footwear and household textiles represent the second highest pressure category, following food consumed in the EU. The majority of pressures on land use come from outside the EU (93 %) and are largely a consequence of cotton cultivation.\nLooking at climate change pressures, the production of textiles generates around 15-35 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of textiles produced. The upstream value chain of clothing, footwear and household textiles consumed in the EU is the fifth highest greenhouse gas emission pressure category. Its contribution is higher than the following consumption categories (Figure 3):\nThe production and handling of clothing, footwear and household textiles consumed in the EU-28 generated emissions of 654 kg CO2 equivalent per person in 2017. Only 25 % of this took place inside the EU-28.\nTextile production processes make use of a large amount and variety of chemicals. About 3 500 substances are used in textile production. Of these, 750 have been classified as hazardous for human health and 440 as hazardous for the environment. It is estimated that about 20 % of global water pollution is caused by dyeing and finishing textile products, affecting the health of workers and local communities.\nWashing releases chemicals and microplastics into household waste water. It is estimated that about half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres are released into the ocean annually from washing plastic-based textiles.\nIn addition to the environmental and climate effects, the highly competitive, mostly linear business models in the sector \u2014 inside and outside Europe \u2014 can have detrimental social impacts. These include:\nAvoiding suppliers outside Europe that use child labour is still a challenge in some regions. In addition, industrial accidents, including fatalities, occur regularly.\nPrivate companies and public authorities are increasingly seeing the potential economic, social, environmental and climate benefits of a circular textiles system. Recently, circular business models focusing on circular textile design, sharing, recycling and reuse of textiles have surfaced. Such business models cannot be upscaled in isolation \u2014 it needs a change in the whole system supported by regulation and other policies.\nIn 2019, the European Commission identified textiles (apparel and fabrics) as a \u2018priority product category for the circular economy\u2019 in Sustainable products in a circular economy \u2014 Towards an EU product policy framework contributing to the circular economy. Furthermore, the new European Commission President announced in My agenda for Europe that she \u2018will propose a new circular economy action plan focusing on sustainable resource use, especially in resource intensive and high-impact sectors such as textiles and construction\u2019.\nEducation and behavioural change are an important part of the shift towards circular textiles to bring about behavioural change across the entire system \u2014 from production and processing to transport, consumption and waste.\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation describes a circular textiles system as one that is:\n\u2026restorative and regenerative by design and provides benefits for business, society and environment.

But despite the fact that they are fairly new raw materials, their versatile and unique \nproperties and multitude of applications, including in textiles, have led to the production of more than 8 \nbillion tonnes of plastics worldwide over the past 70 years (Geyer et al., 2017).  \n \nOver the last 20 years, there has been a great increase in the use of synthetic, plastic-based fibres in textile \nproduction, and expectations are that both shares and absolute volumes will increase further (Textile \nExchange, 2019). Today these synthetic textiles are part of everyday life; they literally surround us. in the \nclothes we wear and the bed sheets we sleep in; we use them to decorate our homes as furniture and \ncushion covers, as curtains and carpets. And often they are present without us knowing, less visible as \nreinforcements in car tyres and sports gear. The 2019 EEA Briefing and European Topic Centre (ETC) report \nTextiles and the environment in a circular economy found that globally about 60 % of textiles are made of \nfibers based on synthetic polymers (EEA, 2019; ETC/WMGE, 2019b). While the majority of these is \nproduced and processed in Asia, Europe stands out as the world\u2019s largest importer of synthetic fibre by \ntrade value (Birkbeck, 2020).  \n \nTextiles play an important role in European manufacturing industry, employing 1.7 million people and \ngenerating a turnover of EUR 178 billion in 2018 (Euratex, 2019). After China, Europe is the second largest \nexporter of textiles and clothing in the world (Euratex, 2019). Alongside the design and production of high\u2010\nquality clothing, Europe is a leading producer of synthetic fibers, technical and industrial textiles and nonwoven textiles, such as industrial filters, medical products and textiles for the automotive sector \n(ETC/WMGE, 2019b).  \n\nTextiles are a policy priority for the European Commission (EC). The shift to a circular economy is regarded \nas an opportunity to establish new job-intensive activities and bring more manufacturing back to the \nEuropean Union (EU) in some sectors, while minimising environmental and climate impacts. As part of the \nEuropean Green Deal, the new Circular Economy Action Plan mentions textiles and plastics as two of the \nkey product value chains that will be addressed as a matter of priority (European Commission, 2020a). \nIndeed, the textiles\u2019 system is characterised by significant greenhouse gas emissions and a high use of \nresources: water, land and a variety of chemicals (EEA, 2019; ETC/WMGE, 2019b). Moreover, it is \nestimated that in 2015, 42 million tonnes of plastic textile waste was generated globally, making the \ntextiles sector the third largest contributor to plastic waste generation (Geyer et al., 2017). Unfortunately, \nsince only about one third of post-consumer textile waste is collected separately for reuse or recycling \n(Watson et al., 2018), the majority of the textile waste ends up in the residual waste and is incinerated, \nlandfilled, or  enters the environment as litter. A specific concern is that synthetic textiles do not naturally \ndegrade, but stay in the biosphere as waste unless they are incinerated.  \n\nWhile recycling rates for non-fibre plastics have steadily increased since the 1980s \u2013 PlasticsEurope \nestimated that about one third of European waste plastics was recycled in 2018 (PlasticsEurope, 2019) \u2013 \nno significant recycling is taking place for fibrous plastics, such as synthetic textiles. To date, end-of-life \ntextiles, both natural and synthetic, almost entirely end up in landfill or are incinerated, either in Europe \nor, after export, in other regions of the world. \n\nResponding to these challenges, the EC will propose a comprehensive EU Strategy for Textiles with \nconcrete policy measures to strengthen industrial competitiveness and encourage innovation in Europe, \nboosting the EU market for sustainable and circular products, services and business models. Member \nStates have to ensure that, by 1st January 2025, textile waste is collected to facilitate the sorting, re-use \nand recycling of textiles.  \n\nFor plastics, the focus is mainly on tackling plastic pollution, particularly from single use plastics, increasing \nrecycled content and reducing waste. Microplastics are a particular concern. As synthetic plastics are a \nsource of unintentional emissions, efforts will target the increased capture of microplastics, for example \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 3 \n\nby filters; improved and harmonised measuring methods; and building the knowledge base related to the \nrisk and occurrence of microplastics in the environment, drinking water and food (European Commission, \n2020a). \n\nThe scope of this report is textiles made of synthetic fibres (Figure 1). These textiles are widely used for \nclothing, household textiles and in industrial applications. Their popularity is due to such properties as \nstrength, elasticity, resistance to shrinking or quick drying. Polyester and nylon are the most common \nfibres, although many others are used as well. Synthetic fibres are produced using organic (carbon-based) \npolymers, which are made from fossil fuels. These fibres are spun into pure or blended yarns and woven \ninto fabrics that receive final finishing to yield textiles with specific aesthetics and properties. \n \nApart from synthetic fibres, a broad variety of other types of fibre is used in textiles. Other man-made ones \nare made from natural polymers such as viscose from wood cellulose and polylactic acid (PLA) from corn \nsugar, or from inorganic (non-carbon) materials such as glass and metal. Natural fibres include plant-based \nones such as cotton and hemp; protein fibres of animal origin including wool and silk, and mineral fibres \nsuch as asbestos (Figure 1). These fibres are not part of the scope of this report, although they are briefly \nmentioned if relevant. \n \nFigure 1 Scope of this report \n\n \nSource: EEA and ETC/WMGE, illustration by CSCP \n\n \nIn this report Chapter 2 presents an overview of current knowledge and data on the production and \nconsumption of synthetic polymers in Europe. This includes estimates of the volumes of synthetic fibres \nproduced in, imported to and exported from Europe. The different types of fibre used in the production \nof textiles are explored, including their properties and applications. Finally, the generation and fate of \ntextile waste generated in Europe is described.  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 4 \n\nChapter 3 provides insights into the environmental and climate impacts of synthetic textiles, focusing on \nresource and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, the use of chemicals and the release of microplastics. \n\nChapter 4 investigates how synthetic textiles could be made and managed more sustainably, focusing on \ndesign choices, circular economy strategies and the mitigation of microplastic pollution. \n \nFinally, Chapter 5 reflects on the report\u2019s findings and their potential implementation in EU action plans \nand strategies on plastics and textiles in a circular economy. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 5 \n\n2 Consumption and production of synthetic textiles in Europe \n \n\n2.1. Consumption of synthetic textiles and fibres in the EU \n \nSynthetic fibres are everywhere in everyday life and are important to our lifestyles. They are in the clothes \nwe wear and the towels we use; they are the stuffing and covers of our sofas, cushions and beds and in \nthe curtains and carpets of our homes. They are in the safety belts of our cars and in protective workwear. \nThey are used as reinforcement materials in plastic sports equipment, such as skis and surfboards, and in \nvehicle tyres. Many of the products we use every day for comfort, leisure and protection are made from \nor contain synthetic fibres. Per person textile consumption estimates come with a lot of uncertainty, as \nvarious studies provide different estimates ranging from 9 to 27 kilograms per person, depending on the \ncountry, data source and product scope (ETC/WMGE, 2019b; \u0160ajn, 2019; Watson et al., 2018; JRC, 2014). \nIn 2017, the total consumption of textile products by EU households was estimated at 13 million tonnes \n(Stadler et al., 2018). \n \nAround 71 % of synthetic textile fibres are processed into clothing and household textiles, and the \nremainder used for technical textiles such as safety wear and in industrial applications including in vehicles \nand machinery (Ryberg et al., 2017). Synthetic fibres are inexpensive and versatile, allowing the production \nof cheap fast fashion as well as high-performance textiles for durable clothing. Today, it is estimated that \nabout 60 % of fibres used in clothing are synthetic, of which polyester is predominant (FAO/ICAC, 2013). \nIn household textiles, synthetics make up around 70 % of household textiles \u2013 mainly polyester, 28 %, and \nnylon, 23 % (Beton et al., 2014). Acrylic, nylon and polypropylene are important fibres in carpet \nmanufacture.  \n \nIn Europe, technical textiles account for an increasing share of the production of synthetic fibres (Adinolfi, \n2019) and currently make up 25\u201328 % of EU textiles and clothing turnover. Technical textiles are also, to a \nlarge extent, made of synthetic fibres. Technical textiles are used in a variety of products mainly used in \nindustry, such as conveyor belts in machinery, filters in air conditioning and medical applications, \nconstruction materials, tyre cord reinforcements for vehicles and industrial safety fabrics used in \nprotective workwear including fire-, heat- or chemical-resistant clothing. Synthetic fibres and fabrics are \nalso used as reinforcements in light-weight composite materials. Such composites are used to replace \nmetals, allowing weight savings in, for example, aircraft and cars (Scheffer, 2012), or as reinforcements in \nsporting goods such as snowboards or hockey sticks. Technical textiles are engineered to meet the specific \nrequirements of each end use, such as durability, chemical resistance or strength.  \n \nPolyester (PET) is the most commonly used synthetic fibre across the world. It has a multitude of uses \nbecause of its low price and fabrics made of it are strong, durable, resistant to shrinking, stretching and \ncreasing. Clothing accounts for a large share of the usage of polyester fibres, but it is also used in home \n\nfurnishings and a variety of industrial applications. Fleece clothing and blankets are a well-known \nexample of the use of recycled PET (rPET) from bottles. It is often used in blends with other fibres, \nsuch as cotton, yielding a lightweight polycotton which is often used in blouses and shirts. Due to its \nversatility and low price, the use of PET has fuelled the fast fashion trend, which relies on cheap \nmanufacturing, fast-changing trends and shorter lifetimes of textile products (Niinim\u00e4ki et al., 2020; \nGreenpeace, 2017). \n \nAfter PET, polyamide (nylon) is the most common synthetic fibre. Nylon is mainly used for knitted apparel, \nsuch as hosiery and underwear, and for technical woven fabrics including airbags, ropes and carpets. It has \nexcellent mechanical properties including high tensile strength, high flexibility, good resilience and high \nimpact strength (toughness). Carpet manufacturing accounts for about 17 % of global nylon usage \n(Carmichael, 2015). \nA broad variety of other synthetic fibres are used in lower quantities, for specific uses. Polyolefin fibres \n(polypropylene and polyethylene) are used in upholstery, carpets and geotextiles, because they are ticker \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 6 \n\nthan other fibres. Acrylic fibres are soft, flexible, thick and fluffy, and some types have flame-retardant \nproperties. They are widely used in blankets, home furnishings and in knitted clothing, such as artificial \nwool for sweaters. Elastane (spandex) fibres are elastic and often used in garments where comfort and/or \nfit are important. Typical examples are sports and leisure wear, elastic corset fabrics and stockings. Aramid \nfibres, such as kevlar, are very strong, five times stronger than steel, which makes them very suitable as \nreinforcements in sports gear including snowboards, and bullet-proof vests. They are also used to replace \nasbestos in automotive parts such as brake and clutch linings. Some aramids have excellent heat resistance \nand are used in protective clothing, hot gas filtration and as electrical insulation. Aramid fibres are also \nused in car tyres as they reduce rolling resistance (CIRFS, 2020a). Chlorofibres are a group of fibres made \nfrom polyvinyl chloride (PVC). They are soft, comfortable, quick-drying, waterproof and insulating, and are \nused in a variety of applications depending on the specific fibre type, such as hosiery and underwear \n(Fibre2fashion, 2020a). Melamine fibres are flame and heat resistant and used in mattresses and \nfirefighting apparel (Maity and Singha, 2012). \n \nIn many cases, different fibres types are combined in blends with other synthetic or natural fibres to \nreduce costs or to build fabrics that combine properties that cannot be achieved with a single fibre. \nPolycotton is the most common blend used in clothing.  \n \nThe global consumption of synthetic fibres increased from a few thousand tonnes in 1940 to more than \n60 million tonnes in 2018, and continues to rise. Since the late 90\u2019s polyester has surpassed cotton as the \nmost used fibre (Figure 2). \n \n \nFigure 2 Global fibre demand, 1940\u20132018, million tonnes per year  \n\n \nSource: CIRFS (2020b) \n\n \n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 7 \n\n2.2. Production of synthetic textiles \n \nThe value chain of synthetic textiles is shown in Figure 3. Synthetic fibres are produced from fossil \nresources, such as oil and natural gas. At a global level, synthetic fibres consume 48 million tonnes of crude \noil per year, around 1 % of total production (EIA, 2020; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). Production \nand use of bio-based synthetic fibres are very limited in general, although the use of some fibre types in \ntextiles amounts to several thousand tonnes per year, for example polylactic acid (PLA) and \npolytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) (Section 4.1 and Figure 20) (European Bioplastics, 2020). \n \nFrom this feedstock, different synthetic polymers are produced, such as polyester or nylon, that can be \nprocessed further into fibres. To produce textile fibres, some manufacturers start from polymer chips, \nwhile others produce the polymer themselves and turn it directly into fibres without producing chips \n(CIRFS, 2020a).  \n \nTo produce textile fibres, the polymer is melted and then the melt is extruded into long, continuous \nfilaments. Depending on the intended use, these filaments can be used as such (continuous filament \nfibres), or they can be cut into shorter fibres a few centimetres long (staple fibres). In order to produce \nfabrics, fibres need to be processed or spun into yarn. Continuous filaments yarns are generally thin and \nsmooth. As the fibres are longer, the resulting yarns are very strong. Nylon is often used in the form of \ncontinuous filament yarn, for example, in fishing nets, swim wear or sewing thread. Because they are short, \nstaple fibres require spinning to produce yarn, but they have the advantage that they can be blended with \nother fibre types, both natural and synthetic, into a variety of yarn compositions and formations. Staple \nfibres are widely used in clothing textiles. \n \nYarns can then be woven into fabrics or knitted directly into final products. Also, staple fibres in their \nfibrous form can be incorporated directly in fillings or compressed into non-woven or felted fabrics (CIRFS, \n2020a). Across the textile production process many chemicals are added to provide the textiles with \ncolours, prints and additional properties. \n \nAbout one third of post-consumer textiles is collected separately, the remainder end up in residual waste. \nOf all collected textiles, up to 50\u201375 % is reused, in Europe or mostly abroad (Watson et al., 2020; 2018). \nMost non-reusable textiles are incinerated or landfilled; recycling of textiles is minimal and mainly focused \non cotton-rich products. The recycling of synthetic textiles is still in its infancy, at the level of research and \npilot scale production. Recycling routes can be split into mechanical recycling processes, based on melting \nand respinning synthetic polymers, and chemical recycling processes, based on the solution or chemical \nbreakdown of the polymers, followed by repolymerisation (Figure 3). \n \n \n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 8 \n\nFigure 3 The value chain of synthetic textiles \n\n \nSource: EEA and ETC/WMGE, illustration by CSCP \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 9 \n\n \nThe following sections focus on the global and European production and trade volumes of the most \ncommon synthetic fibres used in textiles and the chemicals used in their production. \n \n\nProduction and trade of synthetic fibres \n \nThe world of plastics encompasses more than 30 different polymer types, with a broad range of properties, \nfor a multitude of applications. In 2018, global plastics production reached about 425 million tonnes, of \nwhich almost 68 million tonnes were synthetic textile fibres, making textiles account for about 16 % of \nplastic consumption worldwide (CIRFS, 2020b; PlasticsEurope, 2018).  \n \nThe global production of natural and synthetic textile fibres totalled about 107 million tonnes in 2018, of \nwhich synthetic fibres made up almost two thirds (Figure 4) (Textile Exchange, 2019). Over the last 20 \nyears, the production of synthetic textile fibres has more than doubled (Figure 5) and is expected to \ncontinue to rise (Textile Exchange, 2019).   \n \n \nFigure 4 Global fibre production, 2018, million tonnes/per cent \n\n \nSource: Textile Exchange (2019) \n\n \n \n \n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 10 \n\nFigure 5 Global production of synthetic fibres, 1970\u20132018, million tonnes \n\n \nSource: CIRFS (2020b) \n\n \n \nAccording to the European Man-Made Fibres Association (CIRFS), European production of man-made \nfibres amounted to 3.5 million tonnes in 2018, of which 85 % was synthetic (CIRFS, 2020b). The main \nEuropean producers are Germany, Italy and Turkey. A breakdown of fibre types is presented in Figure 6.  \n \n \nFigure 6 European synthetic fibre production, 2018, million tonnes/per cent  \n\n \nSource: CIRFS (2020b), data including Turkey \n\n \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 11 \n\nAccording to Eurostat data,  2.24 million tonnes of synthetic fibres and yarns (1) were produced in the EU \nin 2018 (Figure 7). In the same year, 1.78 million tonnes of synthetic fibres and yarns were imported, and \n0.36 million tonnes exported. This implies that the total 2018 consumption of synthetic fibres and yarns in \nthe EU was 3.66 million tonnes (Eurostat, 2018). This consumption volume concerns \u2018apparent \nconsumption\u2019 by EU industry (2), calculated using import, export and production figures. The outputs of \nthis industrial consumption are intermediate and finished products, which are meant for internal EU use \nas well as for export.  \n \n \nFigure 7 Production, import, export and apparent consumption of synthetic fibres and yarns in the EU (1) \n\n \nSource: Eurostat (2018) \n\n \n \nIn 2018, the EU imported synthetic fibres, yarns and fabrics (3) valued at more than EUR 6 billion from all \nover the world. Imports are mostly from China, followed by Turkey, the Republic of Korea and India. In the \nsame year, the EU exported about EUR 4 billion worth of synthetic textiles, mainly to Turkey, the United \nStates of America (US), Morocco and China (Figure 8) (COMEXT, 2018). These trade figures only include \nextra-EU trade, trade between EU Member States and the rest of the world. The value of intra-EU trade, \ntrade between EU Member States, is much larger, almost EUR 9 billion. Italy and Germany are the largest \ncontributors to both intra- and extra-EU trade in synthetic textiles, both in terms of export and import \nvalue. \n  \n\n                                                           \n1 Synthetic fibres and yarns are reported in Prodcom under product groups 13.10 and 20.60.In the analysis the \nfollowing subcategories (last 4 digits in 8-digit code) of product group 13.10 were included: 3100, 8110, 8150, 8210, \n8250, 8320, 8333, 8336, 8340, 8380, 8390, 83Z0, 8510, 8550; the following product subcategories of product group \n20.60 were included: 1110, 1120, 1130, 1140, 1150, 1190, 1220, 1240, 1260, 1310, 1320, 1330, 1340, 1350, 1390, \n1420, 1440 The production volume in Figure 7 is an estimate, and may contain some gaps or double countings. Since \nEurostat data report \u2018sold products\u2019, fibres that are sold to yarn producers could be counted twice in the data, while \nfibres and yarns that are processed immediately after production into fabrics and other intermediate or finished \nproducts may not appear in the data for \u2018fibre and yarn production\u2019 since they are traded and thus reported under \nanother product code. Synthetic fabrics were not included to avoid double counting. \n2 Since fibres and yarns are base products for textile manufacturing, this consumption can be attributed mainly to \nindustry. Based on this analysis, no conclusions can be drawn on the amount of fibres that eventually end up in \nfinished products for EU household consumption. \n3 Only products containing man-made synthetic fibres, yarns and fabrics are included in the graphs (COMEXT HS 4digit codes 5401, 5402, 5404, 5406, 5407, 5501, 5503, 5505, 5506, 5508, 5509, 5511, 5512, 5513, 5514, 5515). Manmade fibres, yarns and fabrics from artificial fibres \u2013 viscose and others \u2013 are excluded from the analysis. \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 12 \n\nFigure 8 Extra-EU  trade in synthetic textiles, 2018, EUR billion/per cent (4) \n\n \nSource: COMEXT (2018) \n\n \n \nSet in a world perspective, the EU is the third largest exporting region, after China and the Republic of \nKorea.

In terms of imports, the EU is the largest importing region, followed by Viet Nam, China, the US, \nTurkey and Indonesia.  \n \nFigure 9 Major importers and exporters of synthetic textiles (4), 2018, EUR billions   \n\n  \nSource: WITS (2018) based on UN COMTRADE data, exchange rate: USD 1 = EUR 0.89  \n\n \n  \n\n                                                           \n4 Only products containing man-made synthetic fibres, yarns and fabrics are included in the graphs (COMEXT HS 4digit codes 5401, 5402, 5404, 5406, 5407, 5501, 5503, 5505, 5506, 5508, 5509, 5511, 5512, 5513, 5514, 5515). Manmade fibres, yarns and fabrics from artificial fibres (viscose and others) are excluded from the analysis. \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 13 \n\nPolyester \n \nPolyester (PET), a strong, low-cost fibre is the most widely used synthetic fibre and accounted for more \nthan half of global fibre production fibre in 2018 (55 million tonnes) (Textile Exchange, 2019). It is used in \na multitude of applications but clothing accounts for a large share of its use since polyester is a cheaper \nand thinner alternative to cotton. Figure 2 shows how the demand for PET has outgrown that of cotton. \nSportswear is an important use segment, with industrial uses of PET, including in tyre cord, furniture fillings \nand non-woven textiles, expanding.  \n \nPolyester is made from petroleum-derived ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. It is widely used in plastic \npackaging (PET bottles), but textile fibres for clothing currently make up more than 60 % of PET production. \nDespite its current popularity, it only came into use as a textile fibre in the 1970s. To produce textile fibres, \nsome producers start from polyester polymer chips, melt them and then extrude the melt into continuous \nfilaments. These can be used as such or are cut into staple fibres (cut fibres of a specific length).  \n \nOthers produce the polymer and turn it directly into fibres without producing chips (CIRFS, 2020a). About \n60 % of all PET fibres are produced in the form of filament fibres, while the remainder is staple fibres \n(Plastics Insight, 2020).  \n \nChina accounts for around two thirds of global polyester fibre production. When India and Southeast Asia \nare added, these countries are responsible for 86 % of global PET production (Chatterjee, 2018). This \nshows that the European textile industry is highly dependent on imports of PET. Although European \ndomestic fibre production of high-quality, tailor-made fibres is highly efficient, its competitiveness suffers \nfrom higher production costs (CIRFS, 2020c).  \n \nIn 2018, about 13 %, 7.2 million tonnes, of the global PET fibre production was rPET (Textile Exchange, \n2019), mainly made by recycling discarded PET bottles although it can also be made from other sources \nsuch as polyester textiles and collected ocean plastic waste. It is increasingly used in the production of \npolyester textiles, such as fleece garments and blankets. In parallel with technical innovation, sectoral \ninitiatives are emerging to promote the uptake of rPET in the textile and plastics industries (Greenbiz, \n2020). \n \n\nNylon \n \nIn 2018, more than 5 million tonnes of nylon fibre, widely used in tights, carpets and umbrellas, were \nproduced, making it the most common synthetic fibre after PET (Textile Exchange, 2019). Nylon is more \ndifficult to recycle than PET, although recycled nylon fibres made from fishing nets and plastic waste are \nalready available on the market and used in carpet and clothing production (Econyl, 2020). Several fashion \nbrands have made commitments on the replacement of virgin nylon with recycled fibre (Textile Exchange, \n2019). The market share of recycled nylon is difficult to estimate, as reliable production numbers are not \npublicly available. In environmental terms, however, one producer estimates that 70,000 barrels (5) of oil \nand 57,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are saved per 10,000 tonnes of regenerated nylon \n(Aquafil, 2018).  \n \nThe productions volumes of the other synthetic fibres remain below 5 million tonnes per year (Textile \nExchange, 2019; Carmichael, 2015). \n \n\n                                                           \n5 11,200 cubic metres (m\u00b3) of oil. 1 barrel = 0,16 m\u00b3 \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 14 \n\nBlended yarns and textiles \n \nIn order to create yarns and textiles that have properties that cannot be achieved with a single fibre, \nwhether man-made or natural, while remaining comfortable, different synthetic and natural fibre types \nare frequently combined into blended yarns and textiles.  \n \nThe most common blend is of polyester-cotton, or polycotton, usually produced as 35 % \npolyester/65 % cotton or 50 % polyester/50 % cotton blends. Combining polyester with cotton results in a \nstronger material, which is more durable and cheaper to produce while its cotton content reduces pilling \nand static electricity. Furthermore, this fabric keeps it shape and colour for longer and is shrink resistant. \nAs a result, polycotton is a popular fabric for clothing, especially for uniforms and workwear, and for nonclothing applications such as futon, seat and cushion covers (Pearce, 2017). \n \nIn blends, the natural fibres, such as cotton or wool, increase moisture absorbency, increase comfort and \nreduce static electricity. The synthetic fibres, such as polyester, improve durability and abrasion resistance, \nand reduce shrinking, stretching and wrinkling. Nylon is usually added to natural fibres for increased \ndurability and comfort. Blended with wool, nylon decreases itchiness and coarseness, resulting in a fabric \nthat is more durable and wrinkle/shrinkage resistant. Nylon/cotton blends are used, for example, for \nmilitary wear, while polypropylene (PP) is typically blended with wool in carpets to reduce the price. \n \nBlends containing elastane (spandex) are increasing on the market. It is typically mixed in with cotton to \nprovide better stretch and recovery properties in fabrics such as denim and rib knit collars of T-shirts, while \nthe cotton fibres provide a comfortable feel (Jabbar et al., 2020).  \n \n \n\nBox 1: Specialty fibres and smart textiles in sportswear  \n \nToday\u2019s casual activewear and sportswear make use of a broad variety of highly functional and technical \ntextiles. The most common fibre used in sportswear is PET, but nylon, elastane, polypropylene and acrylic \nfibres are also used. Fibre blends and functional coatings are ubiquitous, creating sophisticated clothing \nand footwear that is fashionable, comfortable and resistant to extreme weather and use conditions. \nTemperature and moisture regulation are key properties to assure sufficient thermal insulation, while \nreleasing body heat and sweat during exercise. Stretchability assures freedom of movement and coatings \nprotect against injuries or reduce wear and tear. \n \nBesides conventional synthetic fibres, many specialty ones and smart textiles are used to meet specific \nrequirements. Smart textiles are those that can respond to changes in their environment, such as \ntemperature, moisture, light, pressure, electric currents or acidity, improving comfort and performance \u2013 \nbetter fit, thermal regulation or moisture management (Becker, 2020). Others, known as wearables, have \nintegrated electronics and sensors that can be worn on the body (TextileMates, 2020).  \n \nSportswear brands are increasingly using recycled fibres. Most use rPET made from PET bottles \n(Ambiletics, 2020; Pure, 2020), but some brands also work with recovered ocean plastics or recycled nylon \nmade from discarded fishing nets (Econyl, 2020), or with recycled elastane (Common Objective, 2020). \nSome brands are also looking for plant-based fibres to replace polyester, such as lyocell, which is a soft, \nstrong, drapable, quick-drying and wrinkle-resistant fibre made from wood pulp or bamboo (Bleed, 2020). \n\n \n\nChemical additives \n \nChemical additives are used in all stages of fibre and textile production \u2013 worldwide more than 10,000 \ndifferent dyes and pigments are used in the textile and printing industries alone \u2013 but the majority are \nused as finishing treatments such as those to add water or stain repelling properties, fire retardants, easycare or antistatic coatings, etc. Most are synthetic, in many cases plastic resins, and, as a result, it is \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 15 \n\nimportant to recognise that almost all textiles, including those made of natural fibres, such as cotton or \nwool, should in fact be considered synthetic due to the amount of processing and finishing chemicals that \nhave been applied to them. Many of these, such as dyes, anti-wrinkle agents, water repellents, flame \nretardants or antimicrobial agents, are added to give the textile product additional properties and are \nintended to remain in the final article even after numerous washing cycles. Coatings can make up 5\u201320+ % \nof the final weight of the textile product. Typical materials used for textile coatings are polyvinyl chloride \n(PVC), acrylates and polyurethanes (Singha, 2012).  \n \nAbout 70 % of dyes used in the textile industry are azo dyes that are cost-effective and easy to use. In \norder for dyes to be useful, they must possess a high degree of chemical and photolytic stability. As a \nresult, these compounds do not degrade easily in natural environments and their removal from industrial \neffluents is a major environmental problem (Ciullini et al., 2012). While both cotton and synthetic fibres \nare normally coloured with synthetic dyes, dyeing cotton is usually a more water- and heat-intensive \nprocess \u2013 the surface of cotton fibres is negatively charged and does not readily react with negatively \ncharged dye compounds (Bomgardner, 2018). \n \nAs textiles are typically highly flammable, flame retardants are commonly applied to them, either blended \ninto the polymer or applied in finishing using inorganic salts, organohalogens or formaldehyde-based \nflame retardants. Due to their toxic potential, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has banned many \nhalogenated compounds but to maintain safety standards, new halogen-free flame retardants are being \ndeveloped and substitute products are emerging on the market. One challenge with these, however, has \nbeen their low stability with respect to washing and mechanical abrasion, which has somewhat limited \ntheir applicability in textile finishing (Mayer-Gall et al., 2019).   \n \nOther process chemicals, such as solvents, surfactants and storage preservatives that are necessary in \ntextile production and processing, are not intended to remain in the finished products. Some nonetheless \ndo remain and can cause environmental or health risks during use and recycling. \n \nOverall, the EU is restricting or banning many dangerous chemicals that have been used in textiles, for \nexample, certain azo colours, antimicrobials such as dimethylfumarate (DMF) and certain phthalates used \nto increase softness and flexibility, are restricted under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and \nRestriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. Another group of compounds requiring substitution is \npoly/perfluorocarbons (PFCs) used to achieve water and dirt resistance. Many textile manufacturers are \nalso reducing the number of dangerous chemicals in their products on voluntary basis (ECHA, 2020;  2017).  \n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 16 \n\n \n\nBox 2: Recycling carpets \n \nCarpets are multilayer textile products. They are used in many different environments such as heavy-duty \nindustrial buildings, offices and theatres, as well as in private homes. About 80 % of the fibres used in the \ncarpet industry are synthetic, with the remaining 20 % usually made of wool or cotton. The dominant yarn \nconstructions, making up about 90 % of the market, are combinations of nylon and PP.  \n \nThe EU is the second-largest market in the world for carpets, with European production meeting 65 % of \nthe demand and the remainder being imported (Hilton, 2018).  \n \nIt is estimated that, currently, less than 3 % of carpet placed on the market in the EU is recycled (Hilton, \n2018), resulting in an estimated 1.5 million tonnes of carpet being landfilled or incinerated annually. \nRecycling and/or reuse is challenging due to the complex structure of the products and the chemicals they \ncontain. Previous research (Changing Markets, 2018) has highlighted that over 50 hazardous substances \ncan be present in European carpets. Recyclate from carpets, therefore, is likely to be too contaminated to \nbe used in new products. Currently the major recycling schemes involve energy utilisation in cement kilns \n(Anon, 2019). \n \nA number of initiatives, such as the Circular Carpet Platform, product passports for carpets and suggestions \nto introduce an extended producer responsibility (EPR) system for carpets by certain countries, aim to \nimprove the situation. Many municipalities already organise collections of reusable carpets, although a \nfair amount of the recovered material is downcycled to non-textile applications, such as buckets and \nflower pots, or incinerated for energy recovery (Anon, 2019). \n\n \n\n2.3. Synthetic textile waste \n \nIn 2015, an estimated total of 42 million tonnes of plastic textile waste were generated globally, making \ntextiles the third largest contributor to plastic waste generation, accounting for 14 % of all plastic waste \n(Figure 10) (Geyer et al., 2017).  \n \nFigure 10 Global plastic waste generation per industrial sector, 2015, million tonnes/per cent  \n\n \nSource: Geyer et al. (2017) \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 17 \n\n \n\nThe total amount of textile waste generated annually in the EU is unknown. It is estimated that EU \nconsumers discard about 5.8 million tonnes of textiles annually, about 11 kilograms per person (Beasley \nand Georgeson, 2014). As about 60  % of textiles are synthetic (FAO/ICAC, 2013), this suggests that about \n3,5 million tonnes of plastic textile waste is discarded in Europe each year.  \n \nEven the volume that is selectively collected is high uncertainty as not all Member States keep records, \nand even if they do, reporting is inconsistent and incomplete. For example, textiles that are collected by \nthird-party collectors, whether charitable or commercial, are often not registered (Watson et al., 2020). In \n2016, about 2 million tonnes of textile waste were reported as having been collected separately (Eurostat, \n2016). Collection rate estimates (share of quantity put on the market) vary greatly between countries, \nfrom 0.2 to 12.5 kilograms per person; on average about one third of the volume put on the market is \nseparately collected (European Commission, 2020b; Watson et al., 2018), suggesting that an even larger \nvolume of textile waste ends up in the residual waste.  \n \nSeparately collected textile waste is sorted and a large part is exported for reuse or recycling abroad, \nmostly outside Europe. While percentages vary among countries, about 60\u201370 % of all collected textiles is \nreused locally or abroad), 10\u201330 % is recycled and 10\u201320 % is incinerated for energy recovery or landfilled \n(minor) (Watson et al., 2020). Recycling activities mainly entail lower-value downcycling into industrial \nrags, insulation materials and upholstery fillings.  \n \n\nGlobally, it is estimated that only 0.06 % of all textile waste is recycled into fibres for use in new textile \n\nproducts (Textile Exchange, 2020a). Currently, there is no significant recycling of synthetic textiles and the \n\nlimited fibre-to-fibre recycling that does occurs is mainly mechanical recycling of 100 % cotton products.  \n\n \n\nFibre-to-fibre recycling processes for textiles include mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical \n\nrecycling processes for synthetic textiles include the shredding of the fabrics, followed by melting the \n\npolymers and extruding of new fibres, such as polyester. Nonetheless, most recycled polyester is made \n\nfrom PET bottles and not from polyester textiles. This is because there is already excellent collection \n\nsystems and recycling infrastructure in place for PET bottles, which are pure PET and relatively clean, \n\nmaking it relatively easy to shred them into flakes, melt these and extrude new PET fibres. \n\n \n\nChemical recycling processes rely on the use of specific solvents that selectively target the dissolution of \n\ncertain synthetic fibres. So far, for this to work efficiently and without complications, the technique \n\nrequires textiles to consist only of the same target fibre. Chemical recycling does occur within the textile \n\nindustry, although not yet at a wider industrial scale. Although much research is being done on the topic, \n\nboth for plastics and synthetic textiles (CEFIC, 2020; Adelphi, 2019), there are still many problems, \n\nknowledge gaps and uncertainties about the environmental impacts associated with these processes (Zero \n\nWaste Europe, 2019).  \n\n \n\nAlthough synthetic textiles are technically recyclable, there are currently very few commercially viable \n\nrecycling processes as many economic and technical challenges persist. Firstly, the currently collected \n\namounts of textile waste are not sufficient to support a commercially viable recycling sector. Widespread \n\npost-consumer collection systems need to be put in place to provide a significant volume of continuous \n\nfeedstock supply. Secondly, mixed textiles need to be accurately sorted, which increases the cost of the \n\nrecycling process. Scaling-up the sorting capacity to meet yarn-mill demand would be a first step. This \n\nrequires a shift from manual to automated sorting, using, for example, near-infrared systems (NIR), which \n\nneed to have high quality and quantity sorting capacity to be cost-effective (Watson et al., 2020; WRAP, \n\n2019). Furthermore, a better transparency on fibre content in textile products would also aid better \n\nsorting. Nevertheless, because the majority of textiles contain both natural and synthetic fibres or \n\nmixtures of synthetic fibers, technical feasibility remains a challenge. Although promising innovative \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 18 \n\nprocesses are evolving, especially for the common mix of polyester and cotton (WRAP, 2019; Palme et al., \n\n2017), these applications have not yet reached full technological readiness (Section 4.3). Generally, the \n\nmore homogenous a textile, the greater the chance it has of being returned to the cycle. \n\n \n\nFinally, the market for recycled fibres needs to be developed to find outlets for the recycled materials, \n\nboth within the textile industry and in other applications. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 19 \n\n3 Environmental and climate impacts of synthetic fibres and textiles \n \n\n3.1. Impacts across the value chain \n \nThe production and consumption of textiles have significant environmental impacts including greenhouse \ngas emissions, resource and water use, land use and impacts related to the use of chemicals. The ranges \nof impacts heavily depend on the type of fibre  (ETC/WMGE, 2019b) and synthetic fibres and textiles mainly \ncontribute to the depletion of fossil resources, greenhouse gas emissions and the release of microplastics. \n \nDue to negative perceptions of petroleum-based materials, the environmental impacts related to synthetic \nfibres are often considered more severe than those of natural fibres like cotton. As synthetic fibres are oil \nbased and require large amounts of energy to be produced, they are significant contributors to impacts \nrelated to climate change and the depletion of fossil resources. In contrast to cotton,  the most common \nnatural fibre, however, the production of synthetic fibres does not require the use of agricultural land, \nexcessive use of water, toxic pesticides or eutrophying fertilisers (Sandin et al., 2019). If the environmental \nassessments extended beyond resource depletion and climate change to include other traditional impact \ncategories such as land and water use, and ecosystem impacts, identifying superior fibre types in terms of \nenvironmental performance is not straight forward (Beton et al., 2014).  \n \nWhen looking beyond fibre production alone and taking the entire textile manufacturing process \u2013 yarn \nspinning, weaving, dyeing and finishing of fabric \u2013 into account, there are some environmental advantages \nto synthetic textiles, especially in the dyeing and finishing steps. Polyester, for example, requires high \ntemperature dyeing but the process is shorter and requires fewer chemicals, resulting in lower impacts \nthan cotton dyeing (Natural Resources Defense Council, 2012). There is no fabric, however, with an overall \nbest-in-class manufacturing process; natural and synthetic fibres simply generate environmental burdens \nin different impact areas. These impacts also depend on case specific parameters including fibre thickness, \ndyeing techniques used and whether the fabric is knitted or woven (van der Velden et al., 2014). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 20 \n\nFigure 11 Environmental impacts across the lifecycle of synthetic textiles \n\n \nSource: ETC/WMGE (2019b), illustration by CSCP \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 21 \n\nIn Figure 12, the environmental impacts of the most common synthetic fibres and cotton are compared, \nper kilogram of dyed, woven fabric. It is, however, important to keep in mind that overall (annual) impacts \nalso depend on production volumes of the respective fibres and fabrics. For example, while the \nmanufacturing of polyester fabric uses less energy than nylon, the former\u2019s yearly production greatly \nexceeds the latter\u2019s; therefore, so will its overall energy requirement.  \n \nFigure 12 Comparison of the environmental impacts of the manufacturing of 1 kilogram of dyed, woven fabric  \n(red = worst, green = best) \n\n \nSource: OVAM (2019) and the Higg Index (Sustainable Apparel Coalition, 2020), illustration by CSCP \n\n \nOf course, detrimental environmental effects are not only generated during the production of textiles. \nDuring use, the main environmental impacts are generated by domestic and/or industrial washing, drying \nand ironing. While these caretaking activities require a lot of energy and thus contribute significantly to \nclimate change, they enable longer and more intensive product use, adding to product lifetimes. \n \nThe generated impacts are heavily case dependent; the number of times a product is washed, the washing \ntemperature and the energy efficiency of the appliances used influence the end result to a large extent. \nThe impacts of drying and ironing depend on the product properties and application. As synthetic fibres \ntend to be more wrinkle and stain resistant, dry faster and hold their form better than natural fibres, they \nrequire relatively less care, water and energy for maintenance compared to cotton (CFDA, 2020).  \n \nAn environmental challenge related to synthetic fibres is their large contribution to microplastic pollution, \nof which the long-term consequences on the aquatic environment and species as well as human health \nare still unclear (Henry et al., 2019). This type of pollution is currently not taken into account in state-theart environmental impact assessment methodologies, but mainly occurs during the washing of synthetic \nfabrics.   \n \nWhen reaching the end of their useful lives, some textiles are collected for recycling but most of the textile \nwaste is burned in a municipal waste incinerator, largely without energy recapture, or landfilled \u2013 plasticbased fibres, however, do not biodegrade and remain present in landfill sites for at least multiple decades \n(Common Objective, 2019). In general, the recycling of end-of-life textile products provides environmental \ngains compared to landfilling or incineration. However, these benefits mainly arise by avoiding the \nproduction of new products, but they may remain questionable if the replacement rate is low and the \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 22 \n\nproduction of new products from virgin resources is only replaced to a minor degree, or if the avoided \nproduction processes are relatively clean (Sandin and Peters, 2018a). \n \nFrom a lifecycle perspective it is impossible to distinguish good and bad fibre types in terms of \nenvironmental performance. Burdens differ depending on the impact areas taken into account and results \nare very case dependent. They are heavily affected by the intended use, design and applied manufacturing \nprocesses, as well as caretaking and disposal practices. Obviously (local) regulations with regards to \nproduction, use and end-of-life treatment of textiles and the means of enforcement have a role to play \nhere. Also, the lifespan of a textile product heavily influences the overall impacts, the longer it lasts, the \nlower they are. In this sense it is important to select a fibre type the properties of which suit the intended \nuse. Because synthetic fibres have superior mechanical properties in terms of strength and abrasion \nresistance, they are usually more durable and have longer expected lifetimes. That is why for products \nwith high demands on technical strength, for example, synthetic fibres might be the superior sustainable \nchoice (Sandin et al., 2019).  \n \nThe following sections discuss the environmental impact areas that are most relevant for synthetic textiles: \nresource use, greenhouse gas emissions, use of chemicals and microplastic release. Results are discussed \nfor polyester and nylon, as they are the most common synthetic fibres, and compared to cotton which has \nthe largest share of natural fibres.  \n \n\n3.2. Resource use \n  \nWhen focusing on resource use, synthetic fibres are typically associated with high impacts as they originate \nfrom fossil resources. An estimated 342 million barrels or more than 54 billion litres of oil are required on \nan annual basis for the production of plastic fibres for textiles (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). This is \nthe equivalent of more than 21,000 Olympic swimming pools full of oil.   \n \nFurthermore, as synthetic fibres are entirely man made, their production requires considerable amounts \nof energy. The production of polyester fibres requires two to three times as much energy and nylon more \nthan four times as much as is needed to produce the same amount of cotton (Figure 13).  \n \nOn the other hand, only limited amounts of water, leave alone pesticides and fertilisers, are used in the \nproduction of synthetic fibres. Although the water requirement for the production of cotton fibres heavily \ndepends on the aridity of the region and the specific site where the crops are grown, based on the global \naverage around 26 times as much water is need to produce the same amount of cotton as polyester and \naround four times as much as nylon (Figure 13).  \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 23 \n\nFigure 13 Water and energy, including feedstock energy of synthetics, required for the production of 1 kilogram of fibre  \n\n \nSource: Sandin et al. (2019) \n\n \nA distinction can be made in the energy use related to the production of synthetic fibres between the \nfeedstock energy of the fossil resource (23.1 megajoules per kilogram) and the energy required in the \nproduction process itself. Figure 14 illustrates overall resource requirements when annual production \nvolumes for the different fibre types are taken into account. Given that from a global perspective twice as \nmuch polyester as cotton is produced and ten times as much polyester as nylon, quite a different picture \nis drawn for overall energy and water use.   \n \n \nFigure 14  Water and energy, including feedstock energy of synthetics, required for global annual fibre production, 2018  \n\n \nSource: Sandin et al. (2019) and Textile Exchange (2019) \n\n \nApart from synthetics from virgin sources, recycled synthetic fibres are also becoming widely available.  \nFor example, rPET is made mainly from recycled PET bottles but can also be generated from marine litter, \ndiscarded polyester textiles or from fabric scraps (Textile Exchange, 2019). The production of recycled \npolyester is less resource dependent, requiring 30\u201350 % less energy to make and reducing the need for \nprimary extraction of oil (Textile Exchange, 2018b). Nylon can also be recycled from pre- or post-consumer \nwaste. While pre-consumer waste consists of processing scraps, sources of post-consumer waste are \nmainly discarded fishing nets and carpets (Textile Exchange, 2019). \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 24 \n\nFinally, bio-based synthetic fibres are often mentioned as environmentally friendly alternatives to \ntraditional, virgin fossil-based ones. This might be true in terms of fossil resource use, but the key to biobased synthetics lies in innovative bio-based feedstocks that do not compete in land-use terms with food, \nthat do not rely heavily on water or chemicals and that can be cultivated sustainably (Textile Exchange, \n2019). In environmental terms, feedstocks that are waste based, agricultural residues and organic waste, \nare preferable to crop-based ones such as maize or sugar cane (Textile Exchange, 2018a). Finally, most biobased synthetic fibres, such as bio-PET, are developed to have the same properties and therefore chemical \ncomposition as their fossil-based counterparts. While the production process differs, they have similar \nenvironmental implications during the use and end-of-life phase. It is important to note that the bio-based \norigin by no means implies that the fibres are bio-degradable. \n \n\n3.3.  Greenhouse gas emissions  \n \nAs mentioned, synthetic fabrics require large amounts of energy for the production of their raw materials, \nheavily contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases. Additionally, the use of energy in the finishing \nprocess plays an important role; the formation, weaving or spinning; printing and dyeing of fabrics require \nlarge amounts of electricity (Beton et al., 2014). \n \nThe full lifecycle of 1 kilogram of polyester fabric is estimated to be responsible for the release of more \nthan 30 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, while only around 20 kilograms are associated with cotton \n(Beton et al., 2014). The production of nylon emits nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that per \nkilogram contributes almost 300 times as much to climate change as carbon dioxide (Fletcher, 2014). \nFigure 15 shows the greenhouse gas emissions related to the production of a kilogram of different fibre \ntypes while Figure 16 illustrates emissions for global annual production volumes. Since different sources \nshow significant variations in climate change estimates, the figures show both minimum and maximum \nnumbers as reported by Sandin et al (2019).  \n \nFigure 16 shows that polyester has the largest overall annual impact, due to the large volumes that are \nproduced, while although the production of nylon fibre contributes heavily to climate change, its overall \nimpact remains relatively low due to smaller production volumes.  \n \nFigure 15 Greenhouse gas emissions from the production of fibre, kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of fibre  \n\n  \nSource: Sandin et al. (2019) \n\n \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 25 \n\nFigure 16 Greenhouse gas emissions from global annual fibre production, 2018, gigatonnes (109 tonnes) of carbon dioxide \nequivalent per year \n\n \nSource: Sandin et al. (2019) and Textile Exchange (2019) \n\n \n\n3.4. Chemicals and health \n \nAs discussed in Section 2.2.4, chemical additives are used in all stages of the fibre and textile manufacturing \nprocess, from the raw material production through spinning, weaving and dyeing to finishing. Some are \nadded to improve textile function, including flame retardants and repellents, or for effect such as dyes. \nOthers are auxiliary chemicals, required to facilitate the manufacturing process but not providing any \nspecific properties to the final product (KEMI, 2014). \n \nCompared to cotton, synthetic fibres require fewer chemicals for their production (Natural Resources \nDefense Council, 2012). In 2014, 3.9 % of global herbicide sales, 5.7 % of pesticide sales and 16.1 % of \ninsecticide sales were made for cotton cultivation (Ferrigno et al., 2017). Heavy metals, such as antimony, \na known carcinogen if inhaled, are often used as a catalyst in the production of polyester (Brigden et al., \n2014) and these are also emitted during the recycling process (Common Objective, 2019). To avoid these \npotentially harmful substances, along with others including cobalt, manganese salts, sodium bromide and \ntitanium dioxide, being released into the environment, wastewater treatment is critical in polyester \nproduction facilities (Muthu, 2020).  \n \nFurthermore, synthetics are often the main fibre type making up protective, outdoor and sportswear in \nwhich properties such as durability and fast drying are desired. These textile products are typically heavy \non chemical use as they require specific finishing treatments to be flame or water resistant, or fluorescent. \nIt therefore might appear that synthetic fibres require the use of more chemicals than natural ones, which \nis actually not the case \u2013 chemical use is related to the end application rather than the fibre type.  \n \n\n3.5. Microplastics  \n \nPlastic pollution in the oceans is a widely acknowledged problem, which attracts a lot of attention as \npictures of seashores covered in plastic waste appear in the media regularly. Around 82 % of macro-sized \nmarine litter is plastics, and a further 1 % identified as textile or cloth, of which an unknown part is \nsynthetic textiles (Figure 17). However, it is estimated that only around 6 % of the total mass of plastic \nentering the oceans is actually visible (Sherrington, 2016); the majority of the plastic pollution in the \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 26 \n\noceans is fragments, particles or fibres smaller than 5 millimetres in diameter, so-called microplastics \n(Koehler et al., 2015).  \n \n \nFigure 17 Distribution of marine litter by material, per cent \n\n \nSource: EEA (2020) \n\n \nMicroplastics are shed from synthetic textiles along their entire lifecycles: from fibre and fabric \nmanufacturing, through use and washing, to their final disposal whether by landfilling, incineration or \nrecycling. Although also large volumes of natural polymer fibres like cellulose and fibres of animal origin \nare detected (Suaria et al., 2020), it is estimated that between 0.2 and 0.5 million tonnes of microplastic \nfibres from textiles enter the marine environment each year (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017; Eunomia, \n2016).  \n \nDomestic washing during textile use is considered a relatively large source of microplastics leaking into the \nenvironment. It is estimated that one laundry cycle with synthetic textiles can emit between 700,000 and \n6 million microplastic fibres, representing up to 0.5 % of the product\u2019s total mass (OECD, 2020; Ziajahromi \net al., 2017). In this way, the washing of synthetic textiles may account for up to 35 % of total annual \nmicroplastic releases (OECD, 2020). Together with fabric composition, laundry parameters including \nmachine load, washing temperature, water consumption and the length of the wash cycle are all expected \nto influence the level of shedding of synthetic textiles (Vesper, 2019), but little evidence is yet available on \nthe mechanisms of microplastics release (Salvador Cesa et al., 2017). There is also insufficient proof of \nwhether or not the use of recycled fibres influences shedding rates (Roos et al., 2017).  \n \nFibres are the most common type of microplastic found in wastewater treatment plants, mainly polyester, \nfollowed by acrylic, nylon and polypropylene (Salvador Cesa et al., 2017). The use of nutrient-rich \nwastewater sludge in agriculture poses an additional environmental problem as this can lead to terrestrial \nmicroplastics contamination (OECD, 2020). \n \nIt is important to note that microplastics may also be released to air. For example, up to 65 % of \nmicroplastics may be emitted to aerial environments during drying and wearing of garments (OECD, 2020). \n \nIn common with all plastics, microplastics do not degrade in the short term and accumulate in natural \nhabitats, potentially degrading into even smaller fragments \u2013 so-called nanoplastics. Potentially toxic \nchemicals and additives from the textile industry form an additional risk. They can be present in the \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 27 \n\nmicroplastic fibres themselves or in the surrounding waters where they can be absorbed by the \nmicroplastic fibres (Salvador Cesa et al., 2017).   \n \nAlthough the long-term effects of microplastics on the marine ecosystem are still unknown, microplastic \npollution raises risks for both the natural environment and human health. They are ingested by all kinds \nof aquatic species, ranging from plankton to larger mammals, leading to false sensations of satiation, \nirritation and injuries in internal parts of the digestive system. When ingested, microplastics can also \nimpact on an animal\u2019s fitness and reproduction (Koehler et al., 2015). For land species there is additional \nexposure risk from the inhalation of airborne microplastics and the ingestion of contaminated drinking \nwater. It is becoming clear that chronic exposure to microplastics, at least to some degree, is becoming \ninevitable as microplastics work their way up through the food chain, ending up in human food products. \nUnfortunately, the long-term potential negative health impacts of chronic human exposure to current \nlevels of microplastics are not yet fully understood (Henry et al., 2019; SAPEA, 2019), and for nanoplastics, \nwhich are smaller than 1micrometre (5), an even bigger knowledge gap exists (OECD, 2020). \n \n \n\nFigure 18 Potential release points, transfers and exposure routes of microplastics during the lifecycle of a textile product  \n\n \nSource: Henry et al. (2019), illustration by CSCP \n\n  \n\n                                                           \n5 1 micrometre is one thousandth of a millimetre. \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 28 \n\n4 Towards a circular economy for synthetic fibres and textiles, and the potential \nto reduce environmental and climate impacts \n\n \nIn recent years, awareness of the environmental and social impacts of textiles production and use has \ngrown. Initiatives are being taken, at policy levels as well as within industry, to make the textiles system \nmore circular and sustainable.  \n \nIn the Circular Economy Action Plan, the European Commission has identified textiles as a priority product \ncategory with significant potential for circularity. The Action Plan recognises that \u201ctextiles are the fourth \nhighest pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water, after food, housing and \ntransport, and the fifth for greenhouse gas emissions\u201d (European Commission, 2020a; EEA, 2019). \nResponding to these challenges, the Commission is preparing a comprehensive EU Strategy for Textiles \nwith concrete policy measures to strengthen industrial competitiveness and innovation in Europe, and \nboost the EU market for sustainable and circular products, services and business models. Foreseen \nmeasures include encouraging a market for textile reuse, promoting ecodesign and the use of recycled \ncontent, phasing out hazardous chemicals, and empowering businesses and private consumers to choose \nsustainable, reusable, durable and repairable products and product-as-service models such as sharing and \nrenting. Demand for circular products could be boosted by encouraging public authorities to lead by \nexample and adopt green public procurement, for example by supplying sustainable uniforms for the \npolice and hospital staff. \n \nIn 2019, the first Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for textile products (T-shirts) \nwere developed, based on the Commission\u2019s Product Environmental Footprint Guide in collaboration with \nthe textiles and apparel sector (Pesnel and Payet, 2019). These Rules set a standardised method that \nproducers should use to determine the environmental impact of their products \u2013 in this case, T-shirts. The \naims are to allow benchmarking, to assure comparability between environmental claims that different \nbrands use in communications, to inform consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions and to prevent greenwashing \n(Elsen et al., 2019).  \n \nAs far as textile waste management is concerned, following the revision of the EU Waste Framework \nDirective, Member States will be obliged, by 1st January 2025, to collect discarded textiles separately, \nthereby facilitate sorting, re-use and the recycling of textiles. \n \nWithin the textile industry, action is also being taken to move towards the development and use of more \nsustainable fibres, the improvement of efficiency in production processes and the reduction of the use of \nenergy, water and chemicals throughout the value chain. In the fashion industry, many brands are making \ncommitments to promote textile reuse and to replace conventional synthetic fibres by more sustainable \nalternatives, such as recycled polyester and nylon (Global fashion Agenda, 2020a). Other initiatives focus \non uniting fashion brands to develop a vision on circular fashion (Fashion Positive, 2020), supported by \ninnovation and value chain collaboration to improve industry sustainability and circularity (Euratex, \n2020b). To encourage businesses to adopt more circular ways of working, business inspiration and support \nis provided (Fashion for Good, 2020), including information exchange, the development of standards and \nbenchmarking across the industry (Textile Exchange, 2020b), as well as monitoring tools such as the Higg \nIndex (Sustainable Apparel Coalition, 2020). On the waste side, the aim is to improve the valorisation of \nclothing waste in the EU by better collection (ECAP, 2020) and the development of large-scale automated \nsorting technologies such as Fibersort (Circle Economy, 2020).  \n \nAs a result of the COVID-19 crisis, the EU textiles and apparel industry proposed a recovery plan for the \ntextile, apparel and footwear industries, as an input to the EU Green Economic Recovery plan. This \nproposal includes both short- and medium-to-long-term measures to support the textile sector in \novercoming the consequences of the crisis. The measures outlined in the proposal aim, in the short term, \nto ensure the economic recovery of the sector, including financial support, such as conditional loans, to \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 29 \n\ncompanies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to mitigate cash-flow problems and avoid job \nlosses. These measures should, in the long term, accelerate the transition to a circular, resilient and lowcarbon textile sector, creating new business opportunities and jobs in Europe. The proposed measures \ninclude, among others, incentives for stimulating market demand for circular products and services, such \nas tax measures to promote circular business models including renting, repairing and sharing, and the use \nof recycled fibres. Support is needed for research and development to facilitate circular design and \nsustainable material choices and to help scale-up textile waste collection and high-quality recycling. \nFinally, incentives for increasing traceability and transparency across the textile value chain are required, \ncomplemented by accessible product information for the consumer (Policy Hub and Boston Consulting \nGroup, 2020). In addition, Euratex has proposed a \u201cstrategy for recovery from the COVID-19 era\u201d together \nwith five flagship initiatives, including the ambition to establish five large-scale textile recycling hubs near \nthe major textile and apparel districts in Europe to support the collection, sorting, processing and recycling \nof post-production and post-consumption textile waste (Euratex, 2020c). \n \nA shift towards a sustainable and circular textiles system requires a profound systemic change, including \ninnovative production methods, new business models and social practices, more sustainable behaviour \nand supporting policy measures at all stages of the value chain.  \n \nThe 2019 EEA briefing and ETC report Textiles and the environment in a circular economy presented an \noverview of options for circular business models, regulation and behavioural change in each phase of the \nlifecycle of textiles (Figure 19).  \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 30 \n\nFigure 19 Circular economy options for textiles  \n\n \nSources: EEA (2019); ETC/WMGE (2019b) \n\n \nWhile many circular economy business models and policy measures are independent of the type of textile \nfibre used, involving, for example the phasing out of hazardous chemicals; promoting longer use, shared \nuse and reuse; and improving separate textile waste collections, some specific focus points for synthetic \ntextiles can be identified.  \n \nWithout being exhaustive, the following sections provide an overview of some pathways to make synthetic \ntextiles production and consumption more circular and sustainable, \n \n\n\u2022 Sustainable fibre choices: in the design stage, important choices are made on the fibre types to \nbe used for a particular product or application. These choices significantly affect the \nenvironmental impact of the resulting product and influence the fate of the synthetic textiles \nthroughout the rest of their lifecycle.  \n\n\u2022 Control of emissions of microplastics: concern is rising about emissions of microplastics from \nsynthetic textiles across their entire lifecycles. Several initiatives have been set up recently to study \nthe factors that influence microplastics shedding and assess its effects on human health and the \nenvironment. The design and construction of textile products are crucial here. At the same time, \nmany strategies to reduce the emission of microplastics to water and air are being explored. \n\n\u2022 Improved separate collection, reuse and recycling: reuse and recycling are critical to reducing the \ndemand for virgin fibres and moving towards a circular economy. At the end-of-life stage, accurate \nsorting and high-quality textile reuse and recycling have considerable potential to reduce the \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 31 \n\nenvironmental impacts associated with textile consumption. Fibre recycling is especially \nchallenging in the case of synthetic textiles, due to technical and economic limitations.  \n\n \nThese pathways will be further explored in the following sections. \n \nIn addition to these, improved market surveillance is needed to assure that all products put on the \nEuropean market are compliant with sustainability criteria. Building awareness and changing consumer \nbehaviour and public procurement protocols are also key to encouraging conscious textile buying, even \nwhen the price is higher; longer use; buying second-hand; repair and better textile collection. Awareness \nraising campaigns, clothes swapping events, vintage fairs, upcycling workshops, collection campaigns and \nsimilar initiatives involving young people can help create a shift in mindsets towards more sustainable \ntextile consumption (ECAP, 2019). \n \n\n4.1. Sustainable fibre choices \n\nThe design stage is crucial in the development of a circular value chain for synthetic textiles, with fibre \ntypes usually the first choice made for products or applications. \n \n\nLow-impact, durable and recyclable fibres \n \nSelecting the right fibre can generate significant environmental benefits along the lifecycle of a textile \nproduct. As discussed in Section 3.1, environmental profiles differ considerably among fibre types. The \noverall environmental burden is influenced by the fibre type itself, as well as the intended use, caretaking, \nlifetime and end-of-life treatment of the product.  \n \nGiven that each fibre has specific mechanical, comfort and aesthetic properties, it is crucial to select the \nbest-in-class fibre for the final application and to use each fibre to its full potential. One way of achieving \nthis can be to take the expected speed of product cycles into account in the fibre selection process. This \nmeans that more durable fibres can be used for long-lasting slow fashion and heavily-duty technical \ntextiles, while more brittle fibres can be used for fast-fashion products  (Sandin et al., 2019).  \n \nCompared to cotton, polyester textiles and polycotton blends have superior mechanical properties in \nterms of strength, abrasion and resistance, making them more durable and longer lasting. That is why, for \nproducts which require technical strength, for example, synthetic fibres might be the most sustainable \nchoice (Sandin, et al., 2019).  \n \nOnce a suitable fibre type has been selected, it remains important to look for the lowest impact variants, \nsuch as organic or recycled ones (Natural Resources Defense Council, 2012), and to use them in their pure, \nnon-blended form if possible \u2013 single fibre textiles are easier to recycle after use (Section 2.3.2) as it is \nchallenging to separate and recycle fibre blends such as polycotton. Nonetheless, any textile recycling \nstrategy should be careful not to compromise durability, as extended product lifetimes rather than early \nrecycling are preferable (Watson et al., 2017).  \n \nThe importance of fit-for-purpose fibre selection implies that no fibre types, such as synthetic ones, should \nbe entirely ruled out and that there is no go-to fibre type which of itself would  guarantee a sustainable \ntextile industry. On the contrary, reducing textiles\u2019 environmental footprint requires a great diversity of \nfibres in terms of raw material input, manufacturing processes and properties. This diversity also \ncontributes to healthy ecosystems and allows the building of resilient supply streams (Sandin et al., 2019). \n \n \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 32 \n\nBio-based and biodegradable fibres \n \nAnother option that is often put forward is the development of renewable, bio-based synthetic fibres. \nSome bio-based fibres, including bio-PET, are structurally and functionally equivalent to their fossil-based \ncounterparts \u2013 these are called \u2018drop-in polymers\u2019, which means they can easily replace conventional \nfibres in similar applications. Other bio-based fibres are completely new polymers with new combinations \nof properties for new applications. Some bio-based fibres, such as polylactic acid (PLA), are biodegradable \nbut it is important to note that many, including bio-PET, are not. \n \nAlthough data on the production and use of bio-based polymers are scarce and scattered (Ronzon et al., \n2017), it is clear that current production and consumption levels are low. It is estimated that the \nproduction of bio-based plastics accounts for nearly 1 % of global plastics production, slightly more than 2 \nmillion tonnes (European Bioplastics, 2020; van den Oever et al., 2017). About a quarter of the world\u2019s biobased plastic production capacity is located in Europe, while about 45 % of bio-based plastics are produced \nin Asia (European Bioplastics, 2020). \n \nWhile the main application of bio-based plastics is in packaging, 54%, the equivalent of 1.14 million tonnes \nin 2019 (Figure 20), about 240,000 tonnes, around 11 % of global production, were used in textiles, mainly \npolytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) and PLA. The latter is similar to PET and is often used to replace it, \nmainly in food packaging. Its fibers are also used in the production of a variety of textiles, such as outdoor \nclothing, curtains, non-woven infant wipes and durable landscape textiles (Babu et al., 2013).  \n \nFibres made from PTT unify the best characteristics of nylon, polyester and elastane: they are very durable, \nresilient and dirt-resistant, with excellent elasticity. Compared to other synthetic fibres, PTT is softer, \neasier to dye and has better shape-recovery properties. The most common applications are carpets and \nleisure and sportswear (Fibre2fashion, 2020b; McIntyre, 2005).  \n \nFigure 20 Global bioplastic consumption by sector, 2019, \u2018000 tonnes  \n\n \nSource: courtesy of European Bioplastics (2020) \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 33 \n\n \n\nCurrent industrial initiatives focus mainly on bio-versions of conventional synthetic fibres, such as bio-PET \n\nor bio-nylon. While they are plant-based, mainly maize, sugarcane or plant oils, they have exactly the same \n\nstructure and properties as their fossil counterparts, and thus can be easily integrated into existing \n\nproduction processes. Nevertheless, market shares of these bio-based fibres are still very low. It is \n\nestimated that bio-based PET and bio-based nylon account for less than 1 % of their markets. The global \n\nproduction of bio-based nylon amounts to about 0.24 million tonnes per year. Depending on the brand, \n\nbio-based nylon is derived from castor oil, beans or other plant sources (Textile Exchange, 2019). Bio-based \n\nfibres can also be used in blended fabrics such as wool/PLA and cotton/PLA (Textile Exchange, 2019).  \n\n \n\nMoving away from the use of fossil resources is key in the fight against climate change and resource \n\ndepletion. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has estimated that around 48 million tonnes of oil are used \n\neach year for the production of synthetic textile fibres (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). Bio-based \n\npolymers are mainly made by bacterial fermentation processes from starch and sugars, such as maize and \n\nsugarcane, although concerns about competition with food crops has brought about a shift towards using \n\norganic waste as a resource. Lifecycle assessment data have shown that bio-based products potentially \n\nhave a lower impact on climate change than fossil-based alternatives (Box 3). \n\n  \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 34 \n\nBox 3. Environmental and climate impacts of bio-based fibres \n\n \n\nA study by Semba et al. (2018) calculated that greenhouse gas emissions from the production of 100 % \n\nbio-PET polymer are 24\u201358 % lower than those of petroleum-based PET, depending on the feedstock used \n\nand the production process. A comparison made by Shen et al. (2012) shows that the greenhouse gas \n\nemissions from the production of (partially) bio-based PET and 100 % PLA fibres are considerably lower \n\nthan those of petroleum-based PET fibres (Figure 21). It has to be noted, however, that while the \n\nfunctionalities of PET and bio-PET are identical, the properties of PLA are not fully comparable. \n\n \nFigure 21 Comparison of climate change impacts of (partially) bio-based PET containing 30 % bio-based ethanol and 100 % biobased PLA fibres, cradle to gate, kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram \n\n \n\nSource: Shen et al. (2012) \n\n \n\nNonetheless the production of bio-based raw materials has other sustainability issues, such as the use of \n\nland, water, fertiliser and pesticides. Land use is a particular area of debate, since the cultivation of \n\nbiomass for bioplastic production and other non-food uses can compete with food production for arable \n\nland . It is estimated that the cultivation of crops for bioplastics amounted to 0.8 million hectares in 2019, \n\nwhich is about 0.016 % of global arable land (European Bioplastics, 2020). Such competition for land could, \n\nhowever, become more significant if the global demand for biomaterials and bioenergy resources takes \n\noff. The shift to bio-based materials and energy production requires coordinated action to tackle \n\nsustainability trade-offs. The development of a bio-economy definitely needs to go hand in hand with the \n\ncreation of a circular economy if it is to be sustainable (EEA, 2017).  \n\n \n\nAlthough there is growing interest from textile sector stakeholders in bio-based fibres, there are few actual \n\ncommitments to replacing fossil synthetics with bio-synthetics (Textile Exchange, 2019) and many barriers \n\nstill limit the further commercialisation of bio-based fibres. Production costs of bio-based polymers are \n\nhigher than for conventional oil-based ones; process efficiencies are still low and the supply of biomass \n\nfeedstocks is cumbersome, hindering the building of large-scale plants that would allow economies of \n\nscale. Additionally, as some new bio-based fibres have different structures and properties than \n\nconventional ones, they often cannot yet be handled in current textile production processes.  \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 35 \n\nThese issues could be overcome by blending bio-fibres with other polymers or using additives to improve \n\ntheir performance (Babu et al., 2013). Nevertheless, many initiatives to manufacture various high quality, \n\ncost efficient bio-based fibres are currently underway (Kaeb et al., 2016). The use of carbon dioxide as an \n\nalternative feedstock for elastic fibres is also being explored, but is still at the research stage (Covestro, \n\n2019). Such waste-based feedstocks and new processing routes may further decrease the environmental \n\nfootprint of bio-based materials. \n\n4.2. Microplastic emission control  \n \nAs discussed in Section 3.5, synthetic fibres are a major contributor to the problem of microplastics release \ninto marine, freshwater, aerial and terrestrial environments. Although this emerging issue has gained a lot \nof attention from research and policy over recent years, the topic is still characterised by many unknows. \nImproved understanding and extended knowledge sharing are required on the composition of the fibres \nreleased, microplastics shedding mechanisms, the associated ecosystem and health risks, and potential \nmitigation approaches. To this end, the European Committee for Standardization\u2019s (CEN) testing methods \nto identify and quantify microplastics present in the marine and other environments are currently in the \nfinal stages of development (British Standards Institution - Project, in press). Another requirement is the \nintroduction of harmonised and reproduceable sampling and measurement methods to quantify release \nrates along different lifecycle stages of textile products, and to assess scalable measures for mitigation \n(Pero, 2019).  \n \nInterventions are recommended as far up the textile supply chain as possible to limit microplastics \nshedding further downstream. This does by no means imply that interventions during the use and end-oflife processing of textiles should be omitted, as complementary measures covering the entire product \nlifecycle are indispensable in optimally tackling shedding (OECD, 2020). \n \nOf course, the problem of microplastics shedding is only one aspect of the multidimensional challenge of \nimproving the environmental performance of the textile industry as a whole. Interventions on microplastic \npollution, therefore, need to be embedded in larger policy frameworks aimed at addressing the wider \nenvironmental impacts of the sector.  \n \nAlthough more extensive research is required, Figure 22 provides an overview of potential mitigation \npathways along the lifecycle of a synthetic textile product. These are discussed in the following subsections.  \n \nFigure 22 Possible mitigation action to prevent microplastics release along a textile product\u2019s lifecycle \n\n \nSource: OECD (2020) \n\n \n \n\nDesign and production \n \nAs mentioned earlier, it makes sense to intervene as early in a textile\u2019s lifecycle as possible to avoid the \nrelease microplastics later on. Alterations in the design and production of synthetic textile products could \ndecrease shedding rates in later stages of the lifecycle by as much as 80\u201390 % (OECD, 2020).  While \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 36 \n\nimproved design and manufacturing techniques are still under research and development, some key areas \nof attention are already identified \n \nFirst steps are to prevent fibre irregularities and to preserve yarn strength. This can be realised by melt \nspinning at lower temperatures, choosing continuous fibres over staple fibres to create yarns (OECD, 2020) \nand using the right knitting technique (Vesper, 2019). In terms of the dyeing process, yarn dyeing has some \nbenefits over garment dyeing when it comes to the release microplastics. There are also some mechanical \nand chemical finishing treatments which form a layer over the textile product, protecting and preserving \nit. Although these measures may increase a fabric\u2019s resistance to shedding (OECD, 2020), one important \ndrawback is that they might influence the final product\u2019s properties in ways that are not always desirable. \nApplying ultrasound or laser techniques in the cutting process instead of scissors further reduces the \nshedding risk (Roos et al., 2017).  \n \nFinally, synthetic fabrics tend to release the highest amount microplastics during the first 5\u201310 washings, \nbut this could be reduced by increased pre-washing and filtering in the manufacturing plant (OECD, 2020). \n \n\nUse and caretaking  \n \nIn Section 3.4 the high volumes of microplastics shed by synthetic textiles during domestic and/or \nindustrial washing was discussed. To a certain extent the shedding rate depends on the laundry \nparameters applied. While a lot of research is still ongoing, there is some consensus that washing at low \ntemperatures, in full machine loads and the use of fabric softeners decrease shedding rates (Vesper, 2019; \nOECD, 2020). \n \nThere are some technical solutions and laundry supplements available that limit microplastic shedding \nduring home washing (Textile Exchange, 2019). Examples include laundry balls that claim to collect \nmicroplastics into visible fuzz (Coraball, 2020); a micro-filter washing bag that aims to collect microplastics \n(Guppyfriend, 2020); and filters at the outlet of the washing machine that collect microplastics (Filtrol, \n2020; Xeros, 2020). Some trade-offs might, however, have to be made, especially for these filters, as the \nenergy efficiency of the appliance might be influenced as well as  the duration of washing cycles (OECD, \n2020). It should also be guaranteed that the collected microplastics can be disposed of safely (Roos et al., \n2017), which might prove challenging.  \n \nOne way of informing consumers about the risks of microplastics shedding and possible precautions that \ncan be taken is to include labels on synthetic textiles. \n \n\nDisposal and end-of-life processing \n \nThe risk of microplastic emissions is especially high if textile products are landfilled at the end of their \nuseful lives. Synthetic fabrics do not degrade completely but instead break down into smaller fragments \nand ultimately into micro- and nanoplastics. The aim should be to recycle as much textile waste as possible, \navoiding landfill whether in or outside Europe. If mitigation pathways are developed for microplastic \nshedding within Europe, it would become especially important not to export textile waste to countries \nwhere these might not be in place. \n \nWhen it comes to contaminated wastewater, conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed \nto remove microplastics entirely (Salvador Cesa et al., 2017), although up to 98 % of microplastics can be \nremoved by primary and secondary treatment and there are already some technologies available which \ncan retain up to 99.9 % of them (OECD, 2020). However, an unfortunate drawback, discussed in Section \n3.4, is that microplastics collected from wastewater end up in sludge. This is widely used in agricultural \napplications, leading to the contamination of terrestrial environments. Common sludge treatment does \nnot appear to retain microplastics so solutions to address this pathway of microplastics leakage are \nrequired (OECD, 2020). \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 37 \n\n \n\n4.3. Improved collection, reuse and recycling  \n\nWhile selective textile collection rates vary across Europe, it is estimated that about 4 million tonnes of \ntextile waste are not collected separately and end up in mixed municipal solid waste, while 1.5 million \ntonnes of collected worn textiles are eventually exported beyond the EU (ETC/WMGE, 2019a). Tapping \ninto the potential of high-quality textile reuse and recycling is an opportunity for European industry and \ncould at the same time bring significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.   \n \n\nCollection and sorting \n \nCollection systems for textiles need to be put in place and improved as, across Europe, only about a third \nof used textiles is collected separately, with large differences in collection rates between countries \n(European Commission, 2020b; Watson et al., 2018). To increase this share, several measures could be \ndeployed including awareness raising campaigns and the establishment of accessible collection points \nclose to consumers\u2019 homes \u2013 in shops, schools, community centres, etc. \u2013 or door-to-door collections. Of \ncourse, if large volumes of used textiles are to be collected, sufficient sorting and recycling capacity need \nto be available (Hardy, 2020). To facilitate sorting it could be advisable to install different collection \nsystems for different product types \u2013 separate collection of carpets, reusable clothing, non-reusable items \n\u2013 however, such guidelines need to be clear and simple and should be carefully balanced with associated \ncosts for collection logistics. Separate collection of textile waste will be obligatory in all Member States \nafter 1 January 2025. Harmonisation of sorting procedures and criteria among Member States could be \nbeneficial in supporting efficient intra-EU trade in sorted textiles for recycling.  \n \nTextile sorting is often a manual process, limiting throughput capacity. Moreover, the huge variety of fibre \ntypes; the widespread use of blended fibres; and the presence of contaminants, such as non-textile \nelements, dyes, coatings, etc., makes identification and sorting challenging. Technical innovation in the \nfield of sorting is needed to increase capacity and accuracy through automation and identification of \ntextiles through, for example, the use of near-infrared spectroscopy. Additionally, better pre-sorting by \nconsumers, through separate collection boxes for shoes, T-shirts, denim, etc. in stores, for example, could \nfacilitate subsequent industrial sorting processes. \n \nUnfortunately, the logistics and cost of collection, sorting and recycling often hamper the economic \nviability of the processes and thus the incentive for investment. It is important to note that economics are \ndriven by the share of reusable items, as non-reusable textiles have no value (Watson et al., 2020). \nTransport costs can be reduced by developing sorting and pre-processing of post-consumer textiles \nfacilities close to their source, or at least in-country, to avoid cross-border transport. Changes in regional \nregulations or waste definitions may be needed to ease the transport of used textiles and recycled \nmaterials. To optimise sorting at small-scale collectors, such as charities, shared sorting facilities could be \ncreated (WRAP, 2019). The introduction of an extended producer responsibility scheme for textiles, \nincluding eco-modulation of fees, could be used to raise funding to support investment in collection, \nsorting and recycling capacity in the EU, as well as investment in research and development of efficient \nsorting and recycling processes (Hardy, 2020). \n \n \n\nReuse \n \nTextile reuse refers to various means for prolonging the practical service life of textile products by \ntransferring them to new owners, with or without prior modification. The reuse of textiles has considerable \nenvironmental benefits, since it offsets primary textile production (Schmidt et al., 2016). Customer surveys \nin the Nordic countries revealed that about 60 % of clothing reuse replaces new purchases and thus \ncontributes to reduced consumption (Farrant et al., 2010).  \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 38 \n\n \nThe potential for reuse is significant. It has been estimated that about 40 % of clothes and shoes in residual \nhousehold waste in the UK could have been directly reused (Laitala, 2014). As a matter of fact, research \nhas shown that many consumers prefer to deliver clothing for reuse rather than disposing of them, but \nconvenience is paramount. In general, consumers are more likely to donate used clothes to charities \nand/or friends and family rather than selling them (Savers, 2018; Laitala, 2014). At the same time, there is \na need for consumers to embrace the full cycle of reuse, not only donating, but also shopping for used or \nupcycled products \u2013 a recent study (Savers, 2018) indicates that the proportion of people regularly \npurchasing pre-owned goods is still a minority. Nevertheless, the market for second-hand clothing is \ngrowing, especially online when shoppers were stuck at home due to COVID measures (Marketplace, 2020; \nThredUp, 2020). Some sources expect the reuse market to become larger than the market of fast fashion \nin the next 10 years (Textile Focus, 2020; ThredUp, 2020). \n \nSome service-based business models \u2013 renting, sharing or leasing of textile products \u2013 also make use of \nreuse principles (Sandin and Peters, 2018b). The most prominent examples are clothing and equipment \nlibraries from which consumers can rent items (Adam, 2018) or leasing systems for hotel linens, uniforms \nor workwear (Watson and Trzepacz, 2019). For the customer, such services reduce the need to invest in \nexpensive products and concerns related to storage (Glusac, 2019; Hu et al., 2014). As these service models \nimply more intensive product use and the provider bearing maintenance and replacement costs, they can \nsteer a company\u2019s product design choices towards higher quality, greater durability and increased \nreparability (Holtstr\u00f6m et al., 2019; McCann, 2015). Leasing systems for professional textiles, such as hotel \nlinens and uniforms, also offer the opportunity for improved recycling, since large quantities of \nhomogenous textiles can be collected and processed.  \n \nA number of sports brands have initiated sustainability programmes involving a commitment to buy back \nown-label used clothing in good condition. Some have also introduced a repair policy for own-label \nclothing sent back by customers either for free or for a fair price (McCann, 2015). A recent analysis (Baier \net al., 2020) indicated that returning used products for reuse/recycling is attractive for sports equipment \nconsumers, although the overall importance of sustainability as a purchasing criterion among consumers \nis still marginal compared to other drivers including appearance, comfort, and quality. Reuse platforms \nsuch as rental services and fashion libraries could, however, combine both values in accordance with \nconsumer attitudes (Baier et al., 2020). \n \nNevertheless, business models aiming at reuse, shared use and longer use face many potential obstacles. \nFinancial challenges entail the need for start-up investment and difficulties in convincing financing \ninstitutions to provide funding to these new and relatively unknown business models; and increased \noperating costs of labour, servicing and logistics. Non-financial obstacles are various, such as difficulties in \nfinding textiles for reuse, organising logistics, upscaling, marketing, raising customer awareness and legal \nissues related to waste legislation (Elander et al., 2017). Governments can support businesses in \novercoming these barriers by adopting suitable policy instruments (Watson, Gylling, and Thorn, 2017). \n \n\nRecycling \n \nAlthough reuse has far greater environmental benefits than recycling (Schmidt et al., 2016), it is not always \na feasible option, for example, when a product is damaged or worn out. In those cases, textile recycling is \nthe next option in line. \n \nMore and more brands are setting ambitious targets for the use of recycled fibres from post-consumer \ntextiles in their products as a result of an increased awareness of the environmental impacts associated \nwith textiles (Global fashion Agenda, 2020a; Watson, Gylling, Andersson, et al., 2017). This suggests a great \npotential for high-quality fibre-to-fibre recycling although currently the recycling of textile fibres into new \nones is negligible. This illustrates a supply-demand gap present in the textiles value chain.  \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 39 \n\nThe current textile recycling processes are mainly mechanical, aimed at cotton recycling. These processes \nsuffer from quality loss and are unable to separate different polymers present in blends. To achieve fibreto-fibre recycling for synthetic textiles, alternative (bio)chemical recycling processes are under \ndevelopment (Box 4). Some of them have already been applied industrially but most are in research and \ndevelopment or at a scale-up stage, for example, in the framework of Horizon2020 or Interreg research \nprojects (Decoat, 2020; Enter, 2020; Resyntex, 2020; Retex, 2019).  \n \n\nBox 4. Chemical recycling of polycotton blends \n\n \nCotton-polyester blends can be chemically recycled into cellulose pulp (from the cotton) and a polymer \nfraction (PET). The recovered polymers are then processed into pellets, which can re-enter the yarn \nmanufacturing process, or can be used in other plastic applications.  \n \nPrior to chemical recycling, the feedstock needs to be carefully sorted to meet the process specifications. \nAll non-textile elements and contaminants \u2013 buttons, zips, etc. \u2013 that may interfere with fragmentation or \nwith later stages in the process need to be removed. Since manual sorting is too inaccurate as care labels \nin garments are often missing or washed-out, automated near-infrared identification techniques are \nrequired. \n \nThe first step in the recycling process is the shredding of the feedstock into millimetre-sized fragments to \n\nfacilitate the dissolving process. The choice of solvent forms is a key element of the recycling process. Each \n\nsolvent selectively dissolves or degrades a specific fibre fraction, which then can be separately recovered \n\nfrom the solvent. The recovery of synthetic fibres involves depolymerisation followed by downstream \n\nprocessing to produce polymer pellets. From the cotton, a cellulosic pulp can be recovered that can be \n\nprocessed into a viscose-like material. Finishing chemicals, dyes and other products end up in a waste \n\nfraction that is typically incinerated or landfilled. Spent solvents are typically recovered to minimise waste \n\nand reduce processing costs (WRAP, 2019). \n\nA financial model, created by the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP, 2019), suggests that \n\nchemical fibre-to-fibre recycling of polycotton blends could be financially viable. However, such viability \n\ndepends on the price and availability of sufficient volumes of well-sorted textile waste and the market \n\nvalue of the resulting cellulosic pulp and polyester pellets.  \n\nChemical recycling still suffers from many knowledge gaps and technical hurdles. Sorting capacity and \n\naccuracy remain a challenge, while the economic viability is still questionable. Moreover, there are many \n\nuncertainties about the environmental impacts of the process (Zero Waste Europe, 2019). \n\n \nOther major barriers for high-quality textile recycling from a design point of view are the use of coatings, \ndyes and non-textile objects, such as buttons and zips (ETC/WMGE, 2019b). To tackle these issues, \ncollaboration between designers, manufacturers and recyclers is essential to align product design choices \nand manufacturing techniques with end-of-life treatment options. Aiming for single fibres, the phasing out \nof persistent hazardous substances and enabling the removal of buttons and zips, for example, would \nimprove the recyclability of products at end-of-life. Modulated extended producer responsibility fees, \ndepending, for example, on the recyclability of products put on the market, could stimulate the choice for \nmaterials and designs that are easier to recycle (Scalia, 2020). \n \nTo support the uptake of recycled fibres in manufacturing processes, a marketplace for recycled fibres \nneeds to be developed, with adequate standards and specifications and with prices that are able to \ncompete with the those of virgin equivalents. Internalising the environmental costs of virgin fibres by \nintroducing taxes on virgin raw materials in the form of, for example, refunded virgin payments (RVP) \nschemes, which refund producers proportionally to the share of recycled textile fibres they use, could be \neffective in creating an economic advantage for recycled fibres and material reuse (Elander et al., 2017). \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 40 \n\nFurthermore, demand for recycled fibres could be stimulated by the introduction of targets for recycling \nand recycled content (EuRIC, 2020) or sustainability criteria in public procurement. The development of \nsuitable product codes, such as HS or Prodcom, to register trade in recycled fibres would also allow better \nmonitoring of recycled fibre use, which is currently based on estimates (CIRFS, 2020c). \n \nBetter transparency and traceability in the supply chain would further decrease uncertainties  about \nproduct/fibre quality (Elander and Ljungkvist, 2016) and partnerships between textile product brands, \nfibre manufacturers, recyclers and authorities need to set up to educate each other and work together to \nbring about a circular economy for textiles (Euratex, 2020a). \n \n\n  \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 41 \n\n5 Lessons for the European plastics and textiles strategies \n \n\nThe new Circular Economy Action Plan is one of the building blocks of the European Green Deal, Europe\u2019s \nroadmap for achieving sustainable growth. Plastics and textiles are mentioned in the Action Plan as two of \nthe key product value chains for which the development of a circular economy in Europe should be \nprioritised (European Commission, 2020a). As such, plastic-based, synthetic textiles are positioned at the \ncrossroads of these priority areas. Synthetic textiles play an important role in our everyday lives; they are \nused in clothing, footwear, household linens and home furnishings, as well as in a wide range of technical \napplications, such as protective wear, in transport and machinery. While Europe is the largest importer of \nsynthetic textiles, its domestic fibre production is significant and it is also a large exporter of synthetic \ntextile products to the rest of the world, with the EU industry specialising in specialty fibres and high-value \ntechnical textiles. \n \nPolyester (PET) is the most commonly used synthetic fibre; it has outgrown cotton at the most used fibre \nin textiles. Synthetic fibres have particular properties that contribute to high-quality, high- performing and \ndurable textile products, which, for example, support long product lives and easy maintenance \u2013 qualities \nthat contribute to a circular economy. Nevertheless, the production and consumption of synthetic textiles \ncontribute significantly to environmental impacts such as fossil resource and energy use, greenhouse gas \nemissions and to a lesser extent to impacts related to the use of chemicals. This implies that trade-offs \nneed to be made between the environmental impacts of synthetic textile production and desirable \nproperties that improve product performance and longevity. Also, there is a need for innovation that \ndecouples textiles production and consumption from the use of resources with negative environmental \nimpacts. \n \nA particular point of concern is the release of microplastics, the small plastic fibres that are shed from \nsynthetic textiles during the production, washing and end-of-life treatment. The long-term consequences \nthat these microplastics have on the marine, terrestrial and aerial environments, soil health, aquatic and \nterrestrial species and human health are still unclear, as are the specific conditions that promote or reduce \ntheir release. A lot a research is going on to better understand shedding behaviour and sources, \nquantifying volumes and risks, and finding solutions at different stages of fabrics\u2019 lifecycles to prevent \nshedding and remove microplastics from wastewater. \n \nIt is clear that general initiatives that support the creation of a circular textiles system are also very \nrelevant. These include products designed for durability and repair, innovative and resource-efficient \nproduction methods, new business models that focus on reuse and shared use, awareness raising \ncampaigns that promote sustainable consumer behaviour and supporting policy measures that encourage \nrepair, reuse and recycling (ETC/WMGE, 2019b).  \n \nSince synthetic textiles have a few characteristics of their own, this report explored some pathways that \nhave the potential to improve the sustainability and circularity of synthetic textiles in particular. \n\n- Sustainable fibre choices: the choice of fibres does not only define product properties and \nperformance, but also determines the environmental impact of the resulting product and will \ninfluence the fate of the synthetic textiles throughout the rest of their lifecycles. While a shift to \nnatural or bio-based fibres may reduce the impact related to the use of fossil resources, these \nfibres do not always have equivalent properties and are not necessarily more sustainable. A \nguiding principle is that the choice of fibre should match the anticipated application \u2013 the \nproperties required, expected lifetimes and expected end-of-life processes.  \n\n- Microplastics emission control: although the discovery of this issue is fairly recent, several \ninitiatives have been set up to study the factors that influence the shedding of microplastics and \nassess its effects on human health and the environment. At the same time, many strategies, such \nas adapted textile construction and filters in washing machines, are being explored to reduce the \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 42 \n\nemissions to water and air during a textile\u2019s lifecycle. The EU Plastics Strategy will target increasing \nthe capture of microplastics, for example, by filters; improving and harmonising measuring \nmethods; and building the knowledge base related to the risk and occurrence of microplastics in \nthe environment (European Commission, 2020a). \n\n- Improved separate collection, reuse and recycling: improved separate textile collection, accurate \nautomated sorting and high-quality textile reuse and recycling have a significant potential to \nreduce environmental impacts. Many technical, economic and social challenges, however, will \nhave to be overcome to facilitate and encourage reuse and to make fibre-to-fibre recycling \ntechnically and economically viable. Following the EU Waste Directive, separate collection of \ntextile waste will be obligatory in all Member States from 1 January 2025. This calls for the \ninstallation of sufficient sorting and recycling capacity. \n\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 crisis has led to a decrease in consumer demand for textiles, and \nconsequential cash-flow problems and unemployment in the textiles sector and raised concerns that these \nfactors could slow down the shift to a low-carbon and more circular textile sector. At the same time, it \ndemonstrates the fragility of the current way of working and offers a momentum to fundamentally change \nthe textile system in favour of a circular system with positive economic and environmental outcomes. \nAlready, a trend towards longer use and reuse of textiles is emerging as 71% of consumers indicate they \nare more interested to invest in higher quality clothing and would consider buying second hand, reselling, \nrefurbishing or renting (Global fashion Agenda, 2020b; ThredUp, 2020).To achieve a sustainable and \ncircular textile system, while at the same time supporting economic recovery, the textile and apparel \norganisations have proposed a list of measures (Euratex, 2020a; Policy Hub and Boston Consulting Group, \n2020). Apart from financial support to companies and small and medium-sized enterprises to mitigate \nshort-term cash-flow problems and avoid job loss, the measures include a set of options aimed at \nsustaining and accelerating the transition to a circular, resilient and low-carbon textile sector.  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\f\n \n \n\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/1 43 \n\n6 References \n \n\nAdelphi, 2019, Circular Economy in the Textile Sector - Study for the German Federal Ministry for Economic \nCooperation and Development (BMZ), German Development Agency (GIZ), Bonn, Germany. \n\nAdinolfi, R., 2019, 'Statistics and trends of the EU technical textile production and international trade', \npresentation given at: Press Conference techtextil texprocess, Frankfurt, 2019. \n\nAmbiletics, 2020, 'AMBILETICS | Eco sportswear made from recycled polyester' \n(https://www.ambiletics.com/en/sustainable-fair-activewear/) accessed 29 June 2020. \n\nAnon, 2019, Bodenbelag-Recycling: Angesichts der Quoten auf dem Teppich bleiben, EU-Recycling. \n\nAquafil, 2018, 'Econyl the process' (https://www.econyl.com/the-process/) accessed 6 May 2020. \n\nBabu, R.
