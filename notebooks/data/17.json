The integration of land\ncover, land use and land use change data with other thematic areas is required to address the\nclimate and environmental sustainability priorities of the European Green Deal and other EU policies.\n\nAt a global level, land degradation neutrality is included in target 15.3 of the United Nations (UN)\nSustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs) and land use information underpins several other\ntargets, e.g. SDG target 11.3 on sustainable cities and SDG target 15.1 on conservation, restoration\nand sustainable use of ecosystems. Moreover, SDG target 15.9 addresses the integration of\necosystem and biodiversity values into accounting, among other things. More recently, the  European\nStrategy for Environmental Accounts 2019-2023 describes priorities and actions for the use of\nenvironmental accounts in a harmonised way.\n\nThe EEA\ufffds approach to environmental accounting uses geospatial data and respects the international\nstandards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy, as set out in the UN\nSystem of Environmental Economic Accounting \ufffd Central Framework. A separate briefing describes\nEEA\ufffds approach to developing ecosystem extent and condition accounts (EEA, 2020).\n\nData and methods for land accounts\n\nAccounting is an economic term referring to the systematic process of communicating financial gains\nand losses (i.e. credit and debit). Land accounting therefore requires uniform and harmonised data\non gains and losses in different land categories across the territorial extent in question. Such data\ncome from the monitoring of land cover as seen from Earth observation instruments, such as\nsatellites. Replacing economic assets in the accounts by land cover stocks means the shares of\ndifferent land cover within spatial reporting units, and changes within them, can be quantified. Land\ncover changes can therefore be associated with socio-economic land use processes, and analysis of\nthese changes enables us to evaluate pressures from land use change on the environment.\n\nThe EEA\ufffds land accounting is based on the Copernicus CORINE Land Cover (CLC) datasets for the\nyears 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. CLC status layers for a given reference year (e.g. 2018) use\nmapping units of 25 hectares (ha), but CLC change datasets (e.g. from 2012 to 2018) capture\nchanges at 5 ha. Therefore, simply subtracting one data set from another does not produce the CLC\nchange dataset. In order to solve this, land cover accounting layers are created to produce a\nharmonised time series for the whole period 2000-2018 (ETC/ULS 2020).\n\nThe CLC data set has 44 classes and the number of potential unique land cover changes between\ntwo observation periods is large (i.e. 44*43 = 1 892). Grouping them into change categories known\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting2\n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588580774040&uri=CELEX:52019DC0640\f\nas Land Cover Flows (LCFs) provides transparent assessments, since the flow statistics between\nindividual CLC classes or groupings give important insights into the nature of land cover change\nprocesses. LCFs are defined using three hierarchies that describe different land cover or land use\nchange processes. Of these, level 1 is the most aggregated, containing nine LCF types (EEA, 2006).\n\nThe EEA\ufffds Integrated Data Platform (ETC/ULS, 2020) is made up of geospatial data architecture and\nIT system infrastructure to enable the consistent and systematic production of land and ecosystem\naccounts. In detail, the Spatial Data Infrastructure organises and catalogues geospatial data with an\ninteractive interface. The thematic node Environmental Accounting Reference Layers (EARL)\nassembles harmonised and quality assured datasets. Interactive dashboards enable the exploration\nof geospatial datasets that describe our natural capital.\n\nThe IT infrastructure of the IDP contains the Joint Environmental Data Infrastructure (JEDI, ETC/ULS,\n2020), which uses cloud infrastructure to transfer geospatial data into tabular formats (dimensions).\nUsing data cubes, the dimensions of land cover datasets may be integrated with other dimensions,\nsuch as administrative boundaries, biogeographical regions or bio-physical and socio-economic data.\nFor the integration, uniform reference grids are used with 1 km x 1 km and 100 m x 100 m cells as\nthe accounting units, following INSPIRE directive specifications.\n\nA data cube allows for user driven queries and gives tabular, chart or map results. The EEA\ufffds own\ninteractive dashboard for land accounts (EEA 2019c) displays the land stock and changes to it,\ndetailing statistics by year and by geographical unit (Box 1). Moreover, the data cube allows for the\nefficient combination of various categories of a dimension (e.g. arable lands and permanent crops) or\ncombinations of dimensions aggregated in grids or administrative boundaries.\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting 3\n\nhttps://sdi.eea.europa.eu/\f\nBox 1. Land cover change interactive dashboard\n\nThe EEA\ufffds land cover change interactive dashboard enables land cover\nstocks accounting in Europe. It can be broken down by country and\nincludes various selection choices: year of observation, classification\nhierarchy and breakdown by administrative or biogeographical region. By\nchanging settings, the tables and charts change accordingly to display the\nchosen statistics. The \ufffdAccounting for land cover changes\ufffd tab of the\ninteractive dashboard provides assessments for the drivers of land cover\nchange. Selecting LCF level 1 for the EEA-39 countries, for example,\nshows that in the period 2000-2018, 24 388 km  of arable lands were\ntransformed to some other land cover (i.e. Consumption), whereas 17 160\nkm  of arable lands were added to the existing arable land stock\n(Formation). The difference in these values indicates that arable land\ndecreased by 7 228 km . The rows of the table break these changes down\nto the various LCF categories. This allows us to analyse the causes of\nlosses and gains in arable land cover. For instance, the largest share of\narable land consumption (6 222km2) happened because of growth in\neconomic sites and infrastructure.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting4\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics\f\nAccounting for major land use processes: example on land\ntake and sealing\n\nFigure 1.

The major factors behind land take in the EEA-39 region are\nindustrial and commercial activities, and residential sprawl (EEA, 2019a)  concentrated around larger\nurban agglomerations (Figure 1). In the EEA-39 in the period 2000-2018, 14 049 km  was urbanised\nas indicated by the land take interactive dashboard, mostly at the expense of arable lands and\npermanent crops (around 50 % of the total urbanisation), and of pastures and mosaic farmlands\n(almost 30 %). Soil sealing \ufffd an extreme form of land take \ufffd covers lands with impermeable\nsurfaces, resulting in a decline in land functions. Both land take and soil sealing have slowed down,\nalthough sealing less so: 1.7 % more of the land area was sealed in the period 2012-2015 (compared\nwith an increase of 2.4 % in sealing between 2006 and 2009 in the EEA-39 region (see the soil\nsealing dashboard).\n\nLand recycling \ufffd the reuse of abandoned, vacant or underused land for redevelopment (EEA, 2018)\n\ufffd is still low in all European countries: on average, land recycling accounted for only 13.5 % of total\nland consumption in European cities in the period 2006-2012 (see land recycling dashboard). The\nlargest component of land recycling is densification , i.e. when new urban development makes\nmaximum use of urban space and existing infrastructure.\n\n2\n\n[1]\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting6\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics\f\nAccounting for major land use types: example on agriculture\nand forestry\n\nFigure 2.

There are clusters in eastern Europe, Ireland\nand southern Scotland, as well as in the Iberian Peninsula (Figure 4) where the extent of forest land\ncover is increasing. A decrease in forest land cover was observed in Finland and in the\nMediterranean, for example in Greece, Croatia, Italy, Spain and Portugal (up to 15 ha/km ). Figure 5\npresents the main factors behind local decreases in forest land cover. In Portugal and Spain, the\ndominant drivers of this decrease are forest fires and the conversion of forested areas to agricultural\nland. In Turkey, on the other hand, the spread of built up areas, such as economic sites and\ninfrastructure, have driven local decreases in forest land cover.\n\n2\n\n2\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting 9\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/drivers-of-arable-land-and#tab-chart_1\f\nFigure 4.

This will be facilitated by the Integrated Data\nPlatform for the integration of diverse geospatial datasets. The methods are\nflexible and may be applied to any categorical geospatial data, while\nstatistics can be broken down to any reference region, e.g. administrative\nNUTS units, river basins, floodplains (floodplains dashboard) or Natura\n2000 areas (Natura2000 dashboard).\n\nWith the increasing number of Earth Observation products and their higher\nspatial and temporal resolution, improved capacity for big data processing\nis becoming a must. To provide policy support, the management and\nprocessing of such datasets must follow state-of-the-art standards and\nbecome automated, efficient and up-to-date. The EEA will further develop\nits geospatial environmental accounting system addressing big data cubes\nwith regularly datasets from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. \n\n \n\nFootnote\n\n1.

Figure 5 presents the main factors behind local decreases in forest land cover. In Portugal and Spain, the dominant drivers of this decrease are forest fires and the conversion of forested areas to agricultural land. In Turkey, on the other hand, the spread of built up areas, such as economic sites and infrastructure, have driven local decreases in forest land cover.\nSource: EEA\nSource: EEA\nThe methods for land accounting described in this briefing will be further extended to other environmental topics for general geospatial environmental accounting. This will be facilitated by the Integrated Data Platform for the integration of diverse geospatial datasets. The methods are flexible and may be applied to any categorical geospatial data, while statistics can be broken down to any reference region, e.g. administrative NUTS units, river basins, floodplains (floodplains dashboard) or Natura 2000 areas (Natura2000 dashboard).\nWith the increasing number of Earth Observation products and their higher spatial and temporal resolution, improved capacity for big data processing is becoming a must. To provide policy support, the management and processing of such datasets must follow state-of-the-art standards and become automated, efficient and up-to-date. The EEA will further develop its geospatial environmental accounting system addressing big data cubes with regularly datasets from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service.\n1.

This is a complex challenge which can be assessed in two ways:\n- indirectly, by analysing pressures acting on ecosystems\n- directly, by tracking habitat condition, biodiversity and environmental quality.\nThe EEA has developed pilot ecosystem condition accounts that are examples of these two approaches \u2014 the rivers and lakes ecosystem condition account is based on direct measurement, while the spatial nutrient account analyses nutrient pressures. Please find these under these links:\n- Summary report on pilot river and lake ecosystem condition accounts, 2010-2016 (available during April 2021)\n- Summary report on pilot EU nutrient accounts\nClassifying ecosystem services\nSince 2012 EEA has worked with the University of Nottingham and a wide range of international experts to develop a \u2018Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services\u2019 (CICES). The current version of CICES is available under this link: Resources\nFurther background information on the work of developing CICES is available via www.cices.eu\nThere was a workshop held in 2016 to review different ecosystem service classifications in an SEEA context, see here for documents linked to the workshop.\nFurther EEA ecosystem accounting outputs:\nThis section provides access to further technical work or discussion papers of EEA and its topic centres that have not been formally published as EEA publications.

CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data are produced from 1986 for European (EEA member or cooperating) countries. Altogether five mapping inventories were implemented in this period, producing five status layers (CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018) and four CLC-Change (CLCC) layers for the corresponding periods (1990-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2018). Pan-European CLC and CLCC data are available as vector and raster products. Due to the technical characteristics of CLC and CLCC data, the evolution in CLC update methodology and in quality of input data, time-series statistics derived directly from historical CLC data includes several inconsistencies. In order to create a statistically solid basis for CLC-based time series analysis, a harmonization methodology was elaborated.\n2000-2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:20 AM\nFiled under: clc2012 copernicus clc2006 clc2000 land cover clc2018 clc land and ecosystem accounting accounting corine land use\nFiled under: clc2012, copernicus, clc2006, clc2000, land cover, clc2018, clc, land and ecosystem accounting, accounting, corine, land use\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "The raster datasets describe land cover flows between 2000-2018, 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2012-2018 for the EEA39 region.

Land use and associated changes influence the integrity of ecosystems and our \nnatural capital, which in turn are directly associated to a healthy environment and human wellbeing. \n \nIn order to support and guide policy actions acting between economy and environment, \nharmonized datasets, transparent methodologies and easily interpretable statistics are essential \nelements. The complex interaction between elements of natural capital also calls for a coherent \napproach to facilitate the understanding of the coupled human-environment system. Therefore, \nmonitoring of the structure and condition of ecosystems and their trends, along with properly \nagreed methodologies are urgently needed. \n \nLand and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC) is an EEA initiative which is part of EEA`s geospatial \nenvironmental accounting system. Methods are in line with the framework of the UN System of \nEnvironmental Economic Accounting - Central Framework (SEEA-CF 2012), which provides \ninternationally agreed standards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the \neconomy. The EEA LEAC approach also supports the calculation of ecosystem accounts as \nproposed by the guidance issued by the United Nations Statistics Department on \u2018Experimental \nEcosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA1). This provides opportunity for an integrated measurement \nof trends for individual environmental assets within a given spatial area as proposed by the \nEcosystem Natural Capital Accounts (ENCA) framework (UN-CBD, 2014). \n \nThe present report describes EEA`s approach for producing land accounts using geospatial data \nand providing statistical information in land cover and land use status and changes. After the \nintroduction of the accounting concept, EEA`s accounting infrastructure, the Joint \nEnvironmental Data Infrastructure together with its data cube concept are presented. The \nreport then describes the Corine Land Cover dataset which presently serves as a basis for the \nlong-term land accounting reports of the EEA.

Understanding the status and change of land cover and land use and its impact on natural capital \nis therefore required by many policy processes. This is clearly stated in the 7th Environmental Action \nProgramme of the European Union (7th EAP), in particular under Priority 1 on \u2018Maintaining natural capital\u2019 \nand Priority 5 which sets targets to increase the knowledge about environment and widen the evidence \nbase for policy. While the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 already formulated the need for an integration of \ngeospatial data, the new EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 repeats this need implicitly in the context of the \nnew EU Nature Restoration Plan and by the intent to put in place a monitoring and review mechanism, \nincluding a clear set of indicators.  \n \nLand cover and land use status and change are important elements to inform the development and \nimplementation of policies that deal with the management of our land resources, such as agriculture, \nforestry, biodiversity and climate policies or regional planning. Land cover status and change statistics are \nalso needed to address the \u201cno net land take\u201d by 2050 target of the 7th EAP. An integrated management \nof natural capital is also a key target of other EU environmental policies, such as those on nature (i.e. Birds \nand Habitats Directives), water (Water Framework Directive) and marine (Marine Strategy Framework \nDirective) which are also aiming at integration with sectoral policies and a broader assessment of systemic \nchallenges regarding ecosystem management.  \n \nAlthough a binding legislative mechanism for the sustainable management of land at the level of the \nEuropean Union (EU) is lacking (Frelih-Larsen et al., 2017), the sustainable management of land is crucial \nto ensure that land continues to provide its functions now and in the future. Some EU policies already \nframe conditions for land use, e.g. the Common Agricultural Policy. Others will affect it increasingly in the \ncoming years, including a new EU regulation for land-based carbon accounting (land-use, land-use change \nand forestry - LULUCF) and EU renewable energy and climate goals. At the same time a wide range of EU \nenvironmental policies have a major stake in land management, for example the EU Biodiversity Strategy \nwith its target to \u2018maintain and restore ecosystems and their services\u2019 (Land system concept, EEA, 2018). \n \nAt international level, with the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2016, European \ncountries, which are party to the UNCCD, and the EU have committed themselves to implement \u2018Land \nDegradation Neutrality\u2019 (LDN) in their mandate areas in the period up to 2030. The corresponding SDG \ntarget is target 15 on land to \u201cprotect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, \nsustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt \nbiodiversity loss\u201d. Moreover, the SDG target 15.9 postulates \u201cBy 2020, integrate ecosystem and \nbiodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies \nand accounts\u201d. The international System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a key reporting \nframework for these targets and for a better ecosystem management in general. It comprises inter alia \n                                                           \n(2)  https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf \n\nhttps://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsdg.humanrights.dk%2Fen%2Ftargets2%3Ftarget%3D15.9&data=02%7C01%7CEva.Ivits-Wasser%40eea.europa.eu%7Cb03e82deb63049d179f708d7b94611b7%7Cbe2e7beab4934de5bbc58b4a6a235600%7C1%7C0%7C637181582902436887&sdata=MtU7vXEQiUGRimTUauI4ngarz0z7EM63n976kkJayjA%3D&reserved=0\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 2 \n\nstandards on land and water accounting, published in the \u2018Central Framework\u2019 (SEEA CF), and guidance on \necosystem accounting (SEEA EEA), which will be updated by 2021.  \n \n\n1.2  Monitoring of land and ecosystems as natural capital \n\n \n\u00a9 Nunzio Santisi, Picture2050 /EEA; \u00a9 Lisa Douglas, NATURE@work /EEA; \u00a9 Charles Garnett, Picture2050 /EEA; \n\n \nThe natural capital (next to manufactured, human and social capitals) provides the basic conditions for \nhuman existence (SOER EEA, 2015). It is divided into two main components: ecosystem capital and abiotic \ncomponents. Different components of natural capital can be classified according to a number of criteria, \ne.g. whether they depletable, able to self-regenerate, resilient etc. Ecosystem capital is generally \nconsidered to be the most vulnerable (EEA, 2019). Productive land and fertile soil are part of our shared \nnatural capital. Appropriate management of land and soil is therefore fundamental for sustainable \nresource use and the delivery of ecosystem services (SOER, 2020).  \n \nThe complex interactions between different elements of natural capital and human society calls for a \ncoherent approach to understand the coupled human-environment system. Land use and its change \nimpact food security, carbon cycling, and water cycles, among others. Land use and changes influence the \nintegrity of ecosystems and our natural capital, which in turn underpin a wide range of ecosystem services \nand ultimately human well-being. In order to understand and tackle anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems \nspatially explicit information on the extent and changes of land and associated ecosystems is a crucial \npiece of knowledge. This monitoring must be supported by quantitative, robust, reliable and comparable \nmethods to map the condition and degradation of ecosystems and their services and thus supplying a \nstandardized framework for ecosystem assessment and accounting.  \n \nIn the EU, the analysis of the links between natural capital and human economy and well-being is \nsupported by the EU INCA project and the MAES initiative (Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and \ntheir Services) under the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. This initiative brings together EU bodies and \nMember State organisations to map and assess European ecosystems and their services based on a \nconceptual framework for EU-wide ecosystem assessment. The analytical goal is to measure the state of \nbiodiversity and ecosystems and to evaluate the level of ecosystem services provided to people. This would \nshow the connections between the environment and the economy (economic sectors) by considering the \necosystems from which the services are derived and the different benefits to human society that are \naffected by changes in the supply of services (Maes et al., 2013). \n  \n\f\n \n\n3 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n1.3  Land and ecosystems in the accounting framework \n\n \n\u00a9 Hari Subash, Picture2050 /EEA; \u00a9 Tamara Radusinovic, Picture2050 /EEA; \u00a9 Antonio Sicuro, Picture2050 /EEA  \n\n \nLand and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC), is an EEA initiative aiming to build and apply a European \naccounting system for land and ecosystems (EEA, 2006). This work builds on the framework of the UN \nSystem of Environmental Economic Accounting - Central Framework (SEEA-CF, 2012), which provides \ninternationally agreed standards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. \nTogether with the Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA3) these methods integrate individual \nenvironmental assets within a given spatial area. The support that the LEAC approach provides for \necosystem accounting is described in the \u2018Quick start package for Ecosystem Natural Capital Accounts\u2019 \n(ENCA- CBD, 2014). Additional work of the EEA on ecosystem accounts, water accounts, pilot marine \naccounts etc. is set out in EEA report No 26/2018 (EEA, 2019).  \n \nWork on environmental accounts in the European Union is based on EU Regulation No 691/2011 on \nEuropean Environmental economic accounts 4 . This is complemented by the European strategy for \nenvironmental accounts for 2019 to 2023 5  which is a programme of further work agreed by the \nCommission (Eurostat) and the Member States and adopted by the European Statistical System \nCommittee. This strategy coordinates European efforts and paves the way for possible new modules. The \nEU-level INCA project (Commission, 2019) is a cooperation between several partners in the European \nCommission and the EEA to test and implement a system for integrated natural capital accounting within \nthe SEEA-EEA. Together with ongoing initiatives at country-level they provide a platform for the further \ndevelopment of ecosystem accounting within the EU statistical system. \n \nThe European LEAC database provides the basis for European land accounts. It quantifies the land cover \nextent as stocks and changes (increase and decrease in the extent) as flows between one time-step to \nanother. The LEAC database is based on the Copernicus CORINE Land Cover data series available for every \n6 years between 2000 and 2018 (https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover). The first \nEU 1990-2000 land accounts using the LEAC database were produced for 24 countries by the EEA on the \nbasis of CORINE Land Cover data. They have been updated for 2006, 2012, as well as for 2018 (for the 39 \nEEA countries) in 2019.  \n \nAdditionally, the LEAC database was adopted as the common starting point to generate European \necosystem extent accounts in the EU projects MAES and INCA. Ecosystem extent accounts use the same \nlogic as land accounts to quantify the extent and magnitude of change of different ecosystem types, in \nvarious spatial aggregations (e.g. Natura 2000 areas). The reclassification of CLC classes is based on the \nMAES ecosystem typology (tier I) and a hierarchical selection of CLC class groupings and individual level 3 \nclasses (tier II and tier III) to generate ecosystem extent accounts for 2000, 2006, and 2012 (Natural Capital \nAccounting, EEA, 2019), and for 2018 updated in 2020. \n\n                                                           \n(3)  https://seea.un.org/ \n(4)  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011R0691-20140616 \n(5)  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1798247/6191525/European+Strategy+ \n\nfor+Environmental+Accounts/ \n\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 4 \n\n1.4  An efficient land and ecosystem accounting system \n \nThe development of the EEA land and ecosystem accounting system began nearly two decades ago with \nfull methodological documentation of the approach published with the report \u2018Land accounts for Europe \n1990 \u2013 2000\u2019 (EEA, 2006). Since that period the EEA has published various other land and ecosystem \naccounting reports and accounting data bases.  \n \nAt the same time the need to better manage land and ecosystem resources is as pressing as ever, and the \npressures on our natural capital from climate change, biodiversity loss and socio-economic trends are only \nincreasing. Fortunately, our capacity to monitor trends in natural capital via earth observation is also \nincreasing, in particular via the EU Copernicus programme. This requires the development and \nimplementation of a more efficient land and ecosystem accounting system to connect policy information \nneeds with adequate analytical tools. \n \nThis document is one of several released by the EEA and ETC/ULS in 2020 to document the methodological \nand analytical advances in the EEA land and ecosystem accounting system. It focuses on the describing the \ndata foundation and the accounting infrastructure that underpins the efficient geo-spatial accounting tools \nemployed by EEA and ETC/ULS. This is complemented by illustrative examples of how land accounting \nmethods can support the analysis of environmental pressures arising from land use sectors and land use \nchange. Like the earliest EEA outputs in this domain, this publication is meant to document accounting \nmethods developed at the EEA in support of ongoing international processes that aim to develop coherent \nglobal frameworks, methods and standards for land and ecosystem accounting, in particular within the UN \nsystem of environmental-economic accounting (see above). \n  \n\f\n \n\n5 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n2 Methodological background \n\n2.1  Introduction  \n\n \n\u00a9 Sarah Van den Heuvel, NATURE@work EEA; \u00a9 Vyacheslav Popov, NATURE@work EEA; \u00a9 Eleni Alexiou, NATURE@work EEA \n\n \nThe previous section has described the environmental and policy context for land and ecosystem \naccounting and introduced the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting which provides the \noverall methodological frame for the work described in this report. A summary description of the SEEA \nframework can be found in the recent EEA report on \u2018Natural capital accounting in support of policy \nmaking\u2019 (EEA, 2019). Earlier EEA reports have reviewed the use of the land accounting method for tracking \nlandscape scale changes (\u2018Landscapes in transition\u2019 - EEA, 2017) and described the logic and \nmethodological detail of EEA land accounts (EEA, 2006). The latter report provides a comprehensive and \nstill relevant description of the set-up of the EEA land and ecosystem accounting approach. It also contains \na detailed description of the land cover flow matrix which has been reviewed and brought up-to-date \nduring the last two years. This limited update of the land cover flow matrix has been implemented in the \nEEA land and ecosystem accounting dashboards during the summer of 2020 and is described in this \nchapter. \n \nThis chapter presents key concepts and terms which are part of the land accounting approach (section \n2.2), reviews the main land cover groupings that underpin the LEAC approach (section 2.3) and describes \nthe revised land cover flow matrix (section 2.4).  \n\n2.2  Key concepts and terms of land and ecosystem accounting \n \nAccounting: Accounting is a term related to the financial world which refers to the systematic process of \nidentifying, recording, measuring, classifying, verifying, summarizing, interpreting and communicating \nfinancial information. It reveals profit or loss for a given period, and the value and nature of a firm's assets, \nliabilities and owners' equity6. \n \nLEAC: LEAC stands for Land and Ecosystem Accounting, a system that was developed by the EEA as a \ncontribution to the UN\u2019s Integrated System of Environmental and Economic Accounting7. It began with \nland cover accounts and is meant to be complemented by land use accounts (in linkage to social and \neconomic functions). The EEA LEAC approach also supports the development and calculation of European \necosystem extent accounts and the recording of ecosystem trends under the EU MAES project. \n \nLand (cover) accounting: In the case of land accounting, what is accounted for is the area occupied by each \nland cover class over time, including gains, losses and transfers or flows between LC classes. Land accounts, \nlike those for other types of environmental assets, seek to describe how resource stocks change over time \nin a consistent and systematic way. By doing this, the implications of those changes can better be \nunderstood. The cover of land is not, however, simply an attribute or quality of land, but a concrete set of \nnatural and anthropogenic features that largely results from its use. A given land cover can be modified, \ndegraded or destroyed (consumed) and a new type generated. As such, the consumption and formation \n\n                                                           \n(6)  Business dictionary (http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting.html) \n(7)  https://seea.un.org/content/land-accounts \n\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting.html\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 6 \n\nof land cover is very similar to the transformation of capital goods in the economy. Since land cannot, in \ngeneral terms, be created or destroyed (with the notable exceptions such as coastal erosion and \naccretion), land cover change can generally be characterised in terms of different types of flows between \nland cover types (EEA, 2006). \n \n\n\uf0b7 Consumption: it is understood as the loss of a specific land cover class by conversion to any other \nclasses over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Formation: it is understood as the gain of a specific land cover class by conversion from any other \nclasses over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Balance: the difference between formation and consumption for a specific land cover class over \ntime. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Turnover: the amount of change over time.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 Land cover stock: the amount of land cover existing at a specific time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Land cover change: a specific transition from one land cover class to another over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Land cover flow: a set of land cover changes grouped by a specific process by which those changes \nhave occurred. \n \n\n\uf0b7 CLC accounting layers: specific land cover stock layers made for the purpose of accounting. They are \nbuilt from the CLC stock layers and the CLC change layers over time. Due to the different MMU \nbetween CLC stock (25 ha) and change (5 ha) layers, the stock and change layers are combined into \nthe CLC accounting layers product. Further details are provided in Chapter 3. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LEAC codes: alternative land cover coding suitable for accounting purposes. The equivalences \nbetween CLC and LEAC codes are provided in Table 2-1. \n \n\n\uf0b7 MAES codes: alternative land cover coding developed for accounting for MAES purposes.

CLC level 3 as the most detailed level has 44 \nclasses, there are 15 intermediate classes at level 2 and five broad classes at level 1. Accounting for land \ncover change can in principle be implemented for individual level 3 land cover classes but for ease of \ninterpretation and efficiency a different class combination is used. CLC level 1 and 2 classes are combined \ninto 8 new groups, the so called LEAC (Land and Ecosystems Accounting) categories.  \n \nThe purpose of the LEAC (Land and Ecosystems Accounting) categories is to build up a structured system \nfor describing land cover changes that groups CLC classes with similar land use and/or environmental \ncharacteristics together. The agriculture class for example is split into \u2018Arable land and permanent crops\u2019 \nand \u2018Pastures and mosaic farmland\u2019. Forests are also split into two classes: \u2019Standing forests\u2019 and \n\u2018Transitional woodland and shrub\u2019. The latter mainly maps areas that have been recently felled or new \nplantations. By treating them as part of a more general class of forested land, normal forest rotations are \nnot confused with the losses or gains of woodland that come about through deforestation or afforestation \n(EEA report no 11/2006). The structure of the current LEAC groupings and their link to CLC level 3 classes \nis set out in Table 2-1 below. In addition, Figure 2--2 maps CLC level 3 and LEAC 2B nomenclatures for \ncomparison purposes. \n \nTable 2-1 Aggregation used for land cover accounts (LEAC classes). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2--1 CLC level 3 and LEAC level 2B nomenclatures for the same extent \n\f\n \n\n9 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n2.3.2  MAES classes \n\nFollowing the mandate of EU\u2019s Biodiversity Strategy8, the Working Group on Mapping and Assessment of \nEcosystems and their Services (MAES) has been set-up to co-ordinate the mapping and assessment of the \nstate of ecosystems and their services at EU-level. To this purpose, and in order to be able to account for \nchanges in ecosystems, a correspondence in form of a reclassification was created between CLC classes \nand the so-called MAES ecosystem types. Table 2-2 shows this correspondence. \n \nTable 2-2: Correspondence between CLC classes and MAES ecosystem types \n\nNote: In the EEA ecosystem extent accounting approach (2020, forthcoming) the CLC class 3.3.4 is no longer \nallocated to an ecosystem type as it is a transitory state rather than an inherent ecosystem characteristic.  \nSource: MAES et al., 2013. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n(8)  EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/strategy/index_en.htm \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/strategy/index_en.htm\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 10 \n\n2.1.2 The LCF matrix \n\nWhen it comes to land cover changes between two observation periods, the concept of Land Cover Flows \n(LCFs) has been developed to facilitate transparent accounting. The number of potential unique land cover \nchanges is large (44*43 = 1,892), therefore grouping them into change categories, i.e. flows, is a good \nsolution for transparent assessments. LCFs are defined using a hierarchical structure up to three levels, \ndescribing different processes of land cover or land use changes. Several LCF matrices may be derived, \ndependent on user needs. These matrices are used as Look Up Tables in the accounting infrastructure of \nEEA`s Integrated Data Platform (see Chapter 4). Below is an example of a possible grouping of land cover \nflows at level 1 hierarchy: \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF1 - Urban land management: Internal transformation of urban areas. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF2 - Urban residential expansion: Land uptake by residential buildings altogether with associated \nservices and urban infrastructure (classified in CLC111 and 112) from non-urban land (extension over \nsea may happen). \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF3 - Expansion of economic sites and infrastructures: Land uptake by new economic sites and \ninfrastructures (including sport and leisure facilities) from non-urban land (extension over sea may \nhappen). \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF4 - Agriculture internal conversions: Conversion between farming types. Rotation between \nannual crops is not monitored by CLC. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF5 - Conversion from other land cover to agriculture: Expansion of agriculture land use. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF6 - Increase in forest land cover and other semi-natural areas: Farmland abandonment and \nother conversions from agriculture activity or others in favour of forests or semi-natural land.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF7 - Forest internal land cover changes: Conversions between forest classes or between \ntransitional woodland and shrubs and forest. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF8 - Water body and wetland creation and management: Creation of dams, reservoirs and \nwetlands, and possible consequences of the management of the water resource on the water \nsurface area.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF9 - Changes of land cover due to natural and multiple causes: Changes in land cover resulting \nfrom natural phenomena with or without any human influence, plus rare or not-applicable changes. \n\nFigure 2--2 and Figure 2--3 present \u201cLCF2: Urban residential expansion\u201d and \u201cLCF61: Expansion of forest \nand shrub on agricultural area\u201d.

Altogether five \nmapping inventories have been implemented in this period. These have produced five status layers \n(CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018) and four CLC-change (CLCC) layers for the corresponding \nperiods (1990-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2018). Europe-wide (i.e. EEA-39) CLC and CLCC data are \navailable as vector and raster products. \n \nDue to the technical characteristics of CLC and CLCC data, evolution of CLC update methodology and \nrefinements in the understanding of thematic content (Kosztra et. al, 2017), the time-series statistics \nderived directly from historical CLC data include several inconsistencies. In order to create a solid basis for \nCLC based time-series analysis a harmonization methodology was elaborated. This has created so-called \n\u2018accounting data layers\u2019, which are the data sets recommended to be used for land or ecosystem \naccounting purposes. The methodology for producing this data series is described in this chapter.  \n\n3.1  Summary of CLC mapping methodology \n\nThe first CLC mapping started in 1986 in Portugal, other countries started the mapping later. The first \nEuropean CLC inventory (named CLC1990) includes CLC status information with various reference years \nbetween 1986 and 1996, depending on timing of the national mapping project. The second European \ninventory (CLC2000) already fixed the reference year at 2000 (\u00b11) year, depending on good quality (cloud \nfree) satellite image availability. Three other inventories followed in 6-year periods (CLC2006, CLC2012 \nand CLC2018). CLC status layers are characterised with 25ha Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) and 100m \nMinimum Mapping Width (MMW) \n \nThe mapping of CLC changes started with the 2nd CLC inventory. Due to different reference status years in \ncase of the CLC1990 inventory, the first CLC-Change (CLCC) layer (named CLCC 1990-2000) shows land \ncover changes for various length of periods from 1985-2000 to 1998-2000, while all following CLCC layers \nrepresent the fixed average length of period of 6 years9.  \n \nCLC change layers are characterized with 5 ha MMU and 100m MMW. Delineated CLC change polygons \nare characterized with 2 x 3 digit change types: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Consumption code: CLC status code at first reference year, understood as the loss of a specific land \ncover class by conversion to any other classes over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Formation code: CLC status code at second reference year, understood as the gain of a specific land \ncover class by conversion from any other classes over time. \n\n                                                           \n(9)  Note, at certain locations the reference period may vary in extreme cases from 4 to 8 years due to the \u00b11 year \n\ntolerance for satellite image status. \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 14 \n\nAlthough with 44 classes the possible number of change combinations is numerous (44 x 43 = 1832), many \ncombinations are impossible or at least improbable in practice. CLC changes within EEA-39 include \naltogether 909 occurring CLC change types for the period between 2012-2018. \n \nInitial CLC datasets are provided in vector format by national teams for each update period. The national \nCLC inventories are further integrated into a seamless CLC map of Europe. As a next step, seamless vector \nlayers are converted into 100m resolution raster datasets. Most of the modelling and statistical \napplications are based on the 100m raster version of CLC data. The European vector and raster mosaics \nare distributed via Copernicus Land portal10. \n \nThe traditional way of creating CLC & CLCC layers is Computer Assisted Photo-Interpretation (CAPI). Photointerpretation experts, while performing the visual interpretation and manual delineation, apply a \ncomplex set of interpretation and generalization rules by human abstractions to ensure the production of \nvector CLC & CLCC layers fulfilling the technical and thematic specifications. Besides the original and still \ndominating CAPI methodology, there is an increasing number of countries using advanced (bottom-up) \nsolutions (see section 3.1.2).  \n \nOriginal mapping instructions created for the CLC2000 inventory included the recommendation to create \nCLC 1990-2000 changes as the difference of CLC1990 and CLC2000 status layers. However, due to the scale \ndifference between CLC and CLCC data determined by varying (25ha vs 5ha) MMUs this solution resulted \nin the issue that a significant part of valid CLC changes between 5-25 ha size were missing from the CLCC \ndatabase. As drawbacks of this strategy were clarified only after the CLC2000 mapping started, one part \nof the countries has created CLCC 1990-2000 data by intersection of two status layers, the other part of \nthe countries applied the newly developed \"change mapping first\" approach. The consequence is that \nresulting CLCC 1990-2000 data and statistics are not fully comparable between countries. \n \nBased on a decision made by EEA, from the CLC2006 inventory onward the method to be used for \nderivation of CLC-Change database is producing a change database directly, by means of computer-aided \nvisual image interpretation. \n \nThe key steps of CLC update & CLCC mapping are (B\u00fcttner and Kosztra, 2017): \n\n1. Revision of previous CLC status layer (photo-interpretation) \n\n2. Delineation of CLC changes (photo-interpretation) \n\n3. Creation of \u201enew\u201d CLC status layer:  \n\na) CLCnew = CLCold, revised + CLC changes (GIS operation automated) \n\nb) Generalizaton (eliminating polygons smaller than 25 ha by semi-automatic GIS operations) \n\nThe key advantage of a workflow based on change mapping first is the direct, visually controlled \ndelineation of CLCC features, which ensures a significantly higher reliability of CLCC data than any other \nchange derivation method could provide. \n  \n\n                                                           \n(10)  https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover \n\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover\f\n \n\n15 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n3.1.1  Role of CLC revision \n\nThe revision of the previous CLC status layer is an obligatory step, this is being performed in parallel with \nthe delineation of changes (B\u00fcttner and Kosztra, 2017). Basically three kinds of revision were made in the \nhistory of CLC production: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Systematic correction of specific CLC classes: Class definitions of some CLC classes were refined, in \nthis case a systematic re-interpretation or elimination of these classes were performed within the \ncountry database. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Systematic visual examination of the total area looking for possible mistakes before starting CLC \nchange interpretation. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Ad-hoc revision of the CLC layers, correcting remaining mistakes found during change mapping. \n \nThe great advantage of CLC revision is the additional visual correction step ensuring higher thematic \nquality in all three resulting new layers: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Revised CLC status layer of previous reference date (e.g. revised CLC2012) \n \n\n\uf0b7 New CLC-change layer (e.g. CLCC 2012-2018) \n \n\n\uf0b7 New CLC status layer (e.g. CLC2018) \n \nOn the other hand, since the revision is not harmonized with any of previous CLC or CLCC data, the \nthematic consistency may be lost at several locations between the latest and previous CLC layers. \n \n\n3.1.2  Bottom-up approaches  \n\nStarting with the CLC2006 inventory, some countries have deviated from the traditional CAPI methodology \nby introducing sophisticated, but unique solutions for CLC creation. All of these new methods (referred as \nbottom-up approaches) are strongly influenced by the available high-quality land cover related national \nin-situ data. New CLC status layers are usually created by means of intelligent combination of available GIS \ndata supported occasionally by image classification and / or visual interpretation. Different solutions exist \nfor change mapping, in many cases this is done by the traditional CAPI method based on bottom-up \ncreated CLC-status, or in some cases CLCC data are derived in a (semi-) automatic way. \n \nThe on-going work of the EAGLE CLC+ initiative, as a kind of \u201cessence of national bottom-up methods\u201d, \nproposes a conceptual strategy for a harmonized European land monitoring, including the harmonized \ncollection of land cover, land use and other related spatial data and a robust processing chain and rulesets \nto derive CLC compatible results. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2000 CLC2006 \n\n  \n\nCLC2012 CLC2018 \n\n  \n\nCLC differences 2000 - 2006 CLC differences 2006 - 2012 \n\nFigure 3--1 CLC time-series of the city of K\u00f6ln, Germany. \nThe bottom-up method was introduced with the 2012 inventory. There is an obvious difference between the \namount of CLC differences between periods 2000-2006 and 2006-2012. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n17 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n3.2  Harmonization of CLC time-series \n\n \nSeveral environmental indicators are based on CLC status or CLC change layers. These indicators are \nusually calculated as the combination of certain CLC classes or CLC change types (e.g. land take \nindicator). In order to be able to filter out possible bias caused by CLC methodological changes, it is \nimportant to understand the (country specific) evolution of CLC classes and possible biases within these. \nCLC time-series statistics were created on a country basis, showing evolution of specific CLC classes \nincluding available four reference dates. While the evolution of some CLC classes seems to be as \nexpected, some CLC classes may show critical breaks in the evolution. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEvolution of CLC class 111 in Germany Evolution of CLC class 112 in Germany \n\n  \n\nEvolution of CLC class 242 in Spain Evolution of CLC class 423 in Spain \n\nFigure 3--2 CLC time-series statistics calculated on the basis of original CLC data - 100m resolution \nraster, version 18.5 \n\n \nWhile the evolution of CLC class 112 (Discontinuous urban fabric) shows a logical increasing trend in \nGermany, the sharp loss of class 111 (Continuous urban fabric) area from 2006 to 2012 is more a \nmethodological issue than a real signal. Similarly, the sharp loss of 242 (Complex cultivation patterns) and \n423 (Intertidal flat) class areas from 2000 to 2006 in Spain refers to the lack of harmonization in the time \nseries statistics. \n \nThe explanation in both cases originates in changes of CLC mapping approaches. Spain introduced a \nbottom-up CLC mapping methodology during the 2006 update, while Germany introduced similar changes \nduring the 2012 update. Although CLC data created by both, visual interpretation or bottom-up \napproaches correspond to original CLC specifications and status maps are similar (see Figure 3--2), the \ndelineation of resulting features as well as statistical results may lose comparability. \n \nBesides of major changes in the CLC mapping and update methodology, other possible reasons causing \ninconsistencies in time-series were identified: \n \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 18 \n\n\uf0b7 Evolution of CLC class definitions: Based on verification experiences of past CLC inventories, \nunderstanding of CLC class content as well as instructions for photo-interpretation were refined in \nseveral steps11.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 The CLC update methodology does not consider the full time-series, concentrates only on the \nrevision of past status and to the correct delineation of changes. \n \n\n3.2.1  Methodology for harmonization  \n\nThe solution applied for the harmonization of CLC time-series is applicable for the European CLC mosaics \nfrom 2000 onwards. It is based on the idea to combine CLC status and change information in order to \ncreate a homogenous quality time series of CLC / CLC-change layers for accounting purposes fulfilling the \nrelation: \n \nCLC change = CLC accounting new status \u2013 CLC accounting old status. \n \nAdditional criteria of the realization were: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Add more detail to the latest CLC status layer (CLC2018) from previous CLCC information and use this \n\"adjusted\" layer as a reference \n \n\n\uf0b7 Create previous CLC status layers by \"backdating\" of the reference, realized as subtracting CLCC \nbased information for CLC2018 \n\n \nBased on the above principles, the working steps of the creation of CLC accounting layers is as follows: \n\n1) Include formation information from CLC-change layers into current CLC2018 status by creating \nCLC2018 accounting layer.  \n\na. Overwrite CLC2018 with code_2006 from CLC-change 2000-2006. Intermediate result: \nA1_CLC2018.  \n\nb. Overwrite A1_CLC2018 with code_2012 from CLC-change 2006-2012. Intermediate result: \nA2_CLC2018. \n\nc. Overwrite A2_CLC2018 with code_2018 from CLC-change 2012-2018. Result: CLC2018 \naccounting layer. \n\n2) Create CLC2012 accounting by including consumption information (code 2012 from CLC-change \n2012-2018) into CLC2018 accounting layer. Result: CLC2012 accounting layer. \n\n3)  Create CLC2006 accounting by including consumption information (code 2006 from CLC-change \n2006-2012) into CLC2012 accounting layer. Result: CLC2006 accounting layer. \n\n4) Create CLC2000 accounting by including consumption information (code_2000 from CLC-change \n2000-2006) into CLC2006 accounting layer. Result: CLC2000 accounting layer. \n\n \n  \n\n                                                           \n(11)  The latest CLC technical guidelines as well as present and previous instructions for photo-interpreters are available \n\nat the technical library of Copernicus land portal: https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library \n\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library\f\n \n\n19 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2018 status (original) A1_CLC2018 + CLC changes 2000-2006 polygons  \n\n  \nA1_CLC2018 + original CLC2018 polygons A2_CLC2018 + CLC changes 2006-2012 polygons \n\n  \nA2_CLC2018 + original CLC2018 polygons CLC2018 accounting + CLC changes 2012-2018  \n\nFigure 3--3 CLC harmonization process steps 1. a-c shown by example. \n \n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2018 accounting + CLC changes 2012-2018 CLC2012 accounting + CLC2012 original polygons \n\n  \nCLC2012 accounting + CLC changes 2006-2012 CLC2006 accounting + CLC2006 original polygons \n\n  \nCLC2006 accounting + CLC changes 2000-2006 CLC2000 accounting + CLC2000 original polygons \n\nFigure 3--4 CLC harmonization process steps 2-4 shown by example. \n  \n\f\n \n\n21 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n3.2.2  Results: Harmonized CLC statistics \n\nHarmonization leads to an increased comparability in CLC time series statistics as many effects causing \napparent false changes are filtered out (Figure 3--5).

This does not mean, that the overall spatial resolution of the \nCLC status layer was increased, high resolution features appear occasionally, bound to location of \nCLC changes.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 The presence of under MMU features in a status layer contradicts the original CLC rules and biases \nstatistical characteristics of resulting CLC data. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Although the \u201cchange mapping first\u201c approach assures a high reliability of CLC-change features, no \ncross-harmonization was ensured between CLC-change inventories. This may lead to contradictions \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers/clc-accounting-layers\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 22 \n\nin CLC evolution processes captured by distinct CLC-change datasets and finally may appear in a form \nof unrealistic features in CLC accounting data. \n \n\n\uf0b7 While the revisions were included to the new CLC layer, the pan-European mosaics of previous \nreference dates were not consequently updated with revised CLC layers in CLC2000 and CLC2006 \ninventories \u2192 inconsistency between \u201enew\u201d and \u201eold\u201d status. Example: National CLC2006 was \ncreated via revision and update of national CLC2000. This leads to harmony between national \nCLC2000 and CLC2006 status, but the revisions in national CLC does not appear in European CLC2000 \nmosaic, leading to local inconsistencies of European mosaic of CLC2000 and CLC2006 layers. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Revisions were not applied to all previous status layers \u2192 inconsistency between \u201eold\u201d and \u201eolder\u201d \nstatus. Example: CLC2018 was created via revision and update of CLC2012, these revision were \nincluded to European CLC2012, but not harmonized with CLC2006 and CLC2000 leading to but local \ninconsistencies with previous (CLC2006, CLC2000) status. \n\n\uf0b7 Revisions were not applied to previous CLC changes \u2192 inconsistency between revised \u201eold\u201d status \nand previous change layer.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2018 CLC2018 accounting \n\nFigure 3--6 CLC2018 and CLC2018 accounting layers near Almhult, Sweden. \nUnder MMU (smaller than 2-5 ha) features appear in accounting CLC status layers. \n\n \nFigure 3--7 demonstrates inconsistencies caused by missing harmonization between revised status and \npast change layers. This is an example of the consequences of non-consequent application of \u201cchange \nmapping first\u201d method. Even if previous mistakes were corrected during latest update and CLC2018 status \nshows the correct situation, unrealistic features appear in CLC2018 status because of the lack of \nharmonization between previous CLC-change inventories. \n \nPart of the known issues present in actual version of accounting layers might be eliminated via performing \nraster generalization on accounting results. Conceptual developments within the EAGLE CLC+ initiative are \nalso targeted on developing a methodology for creating harmonized CLC compatible time-series. \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\n23 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2006 status (revised) CLC2006 accounting \n\n  \nCLC2018 status CLC2018 accounting \n\nFigure 3--7 Example of inconsistencies caused by missing harmonization between revised status \nand past change layers. \nForest fire damage (near Val Daubert, South France) around 2006 was recognised by CLC changes (blue \noutlines), but not handled consequently during the update process. Consequence: Some of the burnt areas \nappear erroneously in the CLC2018 accounting layer. \n\n \n\n3.3  The administrative boundaries layer \n\nLand cover and use trends derived from the combination of the time-series of CLC accounting layers \nprovide information at European scale. A detailed understanding of European land cover dynamics is \nfacilitated with the inclusion of thematic or geographical dimensions, such as the political subdivisions of \ncountries, regions and municipalities. Within the land accounting system, a standard administrative \nboundaries layer which covers the whole EEA-39 continental Europe is key for identifying regional trends \nto support national policy objectives. \n \nThe Administrative boundaries EEA-39 layer is a harmonized dataset that combines boundaries \nrepresented by the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) relative to the EU-28 Member \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 24 \n\nStates (in 2019), with the equivalent administrative units relative to the five non-EU EEA member countries \n(Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey) and the six cooperating countries (Albania, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo12, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia).  \n \nIn addition to the official release of Eurostat GISCO 13 , the administrative boundary layer has been \ncombined with the Economic Exclusive Zone dataset14 to assign a country code on the coastal area of the \nCLC accounting layers not covered by the NUTS. This way a perfect matching between the CLC coverage \nand administrative boundaries was achieved. \n \nThe dataset is produced in raster format (GeoTiff) at the same resolution as the accounting layers (100m) \nand contains the aggregation level by Country (NUTS0 and NUTS0+EEZ), NUTS1, NUTS2, and NUTS3 \nregions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n                                                           \n(12)  under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 \n(13)  https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/83f8aa7a-0e3f-4f31-ad95-f9651626d74a \n(14)  http://www.marineregions.org/ \n\nhttps://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/83f8aa7a-0e3f-4f31-ad95-f9651626d74a\f\n \n\n25 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n4 The Integrated Data Platform accounting infrastructure \n\n \n\u00a9 Eleni Alexiou, NATURE@work EEA. @Valentina Pagnanini, NATURE@work EEA; \u00a9 Valentina Pagnanini, NATURE@work /EEA \n\n \nLand and ecosystem accounts describe how ecosystems and land resources change over time in a \nconsistent and systematic way so that the implications of change can be better understood. They are two \ncomponents of natural capital that are vulnerable to depletion and cannot be re-created over periods \nrelevant to most policies. Change can lead to total elimination of ecosystem types; however, for land it is \nmostly the potentials and functions that are transformed through human action. This is expressed by the \ndifferent uses that particular types of land cover can support. A key concern of land cover and ecosystem \nextent accounts is the need to understand the way in which the stocks of different land covers and \necosystem types are transformed over time. \n \nThe land and ecosystem accounting approach adopted by the EEA follows the one recommended in SEEA \nhandbooks and guidance (see section 1.3). The basis of the SEEA approach is to represent the \ntransformation of land cover over time as a transition matrix, which describes the transfers into and out \nof the different cover categories between two time periods. An equivalent approach is recommended for \necosystem extent accounts. \n \nThe EEA approach for developing land and ecosystem accounts builds on the Integrated Data Platform \n(IDP) infrastructure. The Integrated Data Platform targets integrated geo-spatial data assessments. \nThrough discovering semantic and contextual linkages between datasets, the IDP supports the \nunderstanding of how various elements of our natural capital can be best understood in relationships with \neach other and with other systems. This chapter describes the various building elements of this accounting \ninfrastructure. \n \nProducts of the IDP derived through the tools below are published and maintained on EEA\u00b4s Geospatial \nEnvironmental Accounting website: \n \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/  \n \n\n4.1 The EEA reference grid as common data integrator \n\nThe use of reference grids has been recognised as key point for the integration of heterogeneous sources \nof data. The standard codification of grid cells makes the reference grids suitable for splitting the territory \ninto a number of regular pieces that can be used as analysis units.  \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 26 \n\n \n\nFigure 4--1 LCF6 \u2013 The EEA reference grid as a common data integrator. \n \nThe 1 km2 European Reference Grid (ERG) was adopted by several European stakeholders at the First \nWorkshop on European Reference Grids (JRC-IES-LMU-ESDI, 2003). This layer was adopted as the common \nEEA reference grid and data integrator layer. In this layer the grid cells store the land cover information \n(i.e. the area of land cover classes) and complementary information to be used as reporting units or \nancillary datasets for the assessments. Depending on the nature of the dataset or variable, we distinguish: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Geographic dimensions: define the geographical unit that each cell belongs to (NUTS region, NUTS, \nUMZ, biogeographical unit, etc.) \n \n\n\uf0b7 Thematic dimensions: define a physical characteristic of a grid cell, such as land cover type. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Measures: numeric variables which can be aggregated by any combination of the data dimensions \navailable in the accounting model. They can be biophysical variables (e.g. vegetation productivity), \nclimate (precipitation, temperature) but also socioeconomic figures (e.g. population, unemployment, \nGDP, etc). \n \n\nThe EEA-39 reference grid consists of 5 885 212, 1 km cells (CLC non-NULL), each of which can hold a data \nrecord in the LEAC database. The geographic and reference dimensions are intersected with the 1 km2 EEA \nreference grid, in order to give each grid cell a unique feature code (e.g. a NUTS3 code, a Biogeographical \nregion code, etc.). \n \nConsidering that some thematic layers have a higher resolution than 1 km2 (e.g. Corine Land Cover is \navailable at 100 m2 resolution), the combination of such information is carried out at 100 m2. In this way, \nit is possible to store, for instance, the different land cover classes and their surfaces for each grid cell. This \nmeans it is also feasible in principle to run account calculations at the 100 m2 grid level. The grid cell index \n(unique identifier for each grid cell) might appear repeated in the resulting output table, as many times as \ndifferent land cover classes exist within the square kilometre. Geographic dimensions will have their code \nrepeated as well: \n\f\n \n\n27 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 4-2 Example of unique combination of units within a grid cell \n\n \n\n4.2 The accounting infrastructure \n\nThe EEA IDP project basically addresses 3 working areas: \n\n1) Organise knowledge - spatial data management: This module is working on spatial data \nmanagement. Tasks identify, describe and integrate key spatial datasets into EEA\u2019s Spatial Data \nInfrastructure (SDI).  \n\n\uf0d7 Spatial data QA/QC and harmonization \n\n\uf0d7 Spatial data registration in EEA\u2019s Spatial Data Infrastructure \n\n\uf0d7 Linking SDI metadata to other EEA systems  \n2) Inventory of knowledge - semantic inventory of spatial data sets simplifies the complexity around \n\ngeo-spatial data. The complexity is caused by numerous working areas and analytical expertise. \nThe inventory module of the Integrated Data Platform therefore develops a contextual \nframework, by discovering, organizing and structuring semantic information about our geo-spatial \ndata. This becomes a contextual inventory, summarizing the technical, thematic and contextual \ninformation of EEA\u2019s spatial datasets, which supports the needs of the analytical community. Three \ncontextual inventories are developed: \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive contextual data inventory  \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive data linkages \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive web map platform  \n3) Integrated analysis using organised knowledge: Solutions in this working area directly enable \n\nintegrated assessments by a system infrastructure combining geo-spatial and tabular datasets \n\nfrom a wide range of data sources and properties. Working area are:  \n\n\uf0d7 Data cubes \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive data viewers \n\n\uf0d7 Integrated modelling \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 28 \n\n \nFigure 4--2 The three working areas of the EEA IDP project. \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Spatial data harmonization \n\nAll EEAs accounting datasets must be harmonized and managed correctly so that they have the best \npossible quality. A spatial data delivery workflow was designed with Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality \nControl (QC) criteria for spatial datasets to be harmonized. Although these criteria are meant for spatial \ndatasets, there are other types of information, which are closely related to spatial datasets. Map \ntemplates, draft maps, tabular data and the delivery of graphs related to spatial datasets are therefore \nalso addressed. Compulsory deliveries which must accompany spatial datasets are 1) metadata, 2) web \nmap services, 3) layer (*.lyr) files, draft maps and map templates if intended for publications.  \n \n\n4.2.2 Spatial data registration in EEA\u2019s Spatial Data Infrastructure \n\nWithout a structured inventory any work with data too often requires asking around for relevant datasets \nhoping that someone can point us to the right direction. Once a data set is found one may have to guess \nhow to interpret it, whether it is right for the analysis. Clear and reliable documentation is required to \nknow that the data is accurate, correct and that it does not contain errors. A structured and centralised \nsystem for documenting and searching data sets is needed to ensure that identification and use of data \nsets for assessment purposes can be done in an efficient manner. \n \nAll EEA spatial datasets are registered in EEA`s Spatial Data Infrastructure including a link to the \ncorresponding Discomap web map services15. The data stored in the EEA`s SDI16 are searchable through \nthe SDI catalogue, accessible via: \n \n\n\uf0b7 https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/ \n \nThe website also contains a metadata editor to draft metadata, compliant with EEA metadata profile. The \nSDI wiki, which is also hosted on the website provides user manuals and details on the metadata profile.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(15)  https://discomap.eea.europa.eu/Index/  \n(16)  http://sdi.eea.europa.eu/  \n\nhttps://sdi.eea.europa.eu/\f\n \n\n29 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\nThe datasets, once validated, are physically stored in the SDI file system. Public datasets are available to \nany user without need to log in. Restricted datasets are only accessible with an Eionet log-in (EEA staff, \nEuropean Topic Centres and other Eionet partners). The actual metadata (for public and restricted \ndatasets) are publicly available. \n \nEEA has a thematic node in its SDI on Environmental Analytical Reference Layers (EARL)17, which are \nharmonized and QA/QCd and can be used for environmental accounting.  \n \n\n4.2.3 Interlinking IT systems - Contextual Data Inventory  \n\nOrganised and harmonised storage of spatial datasets and their metadata is indispensable for a data \narchitecture, which is to enable a transparent and repeatable accounting of our natural capital. However, \nthese spatial data specifications are difficult to retrieve for thematic experts because they are not \norganized according to the needs of analytical objectives. In some cases, the information is encrypted in a \ntechnical language that that is not easily understandable for non-IT-experts. For a comprehensive \ninformation system, SDI specifications (e.g. spatial resolution, data format) should be enhanced by \nthematic and contextual information (e.g. DPSIR18 elements, policy objective, topics). These semantics \nneed to be brought together in a Contextual Data Inventory (CDI). Therefore, SDI specifications are linked \nto EEA`s Semantic Data Service (SDS) so that technical information of spatial datasets can be harvested in \na way which targets specific user groups. \n \nThis information is stored in several distinct systems, such as the SDI, the EEA Website CMS (Content \nManagement System), the Semantic Data Service and the server for web map services. These are brought \ntogether in EEA`s Contextual Data Inventory: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Explore the Interactive Contextual Data Inventory on the Geospatial Environmental Accounting \nportal (see under Inventory/Contextual data inventory). \n\n \nPopulating the inventory is generated at regular time intervals (once a day): once the datasets are \nregistered in the SDI and other information are entered in the CMS the information are automatically \nextracted from different systems.  \n \n\n4.2.4 Interactive data linkages  \n\nThe geospatial data inventory is supported by interactive entity relation diagrams in order to increase the \ntransparency and accessibility of the contained information.  \nIn such a visual analytics tool, connections are established on demand, following the users\u2019 interest, in \norder to facilitate the efficient identification of similarities, differences, gaps and complex relationships \nbetween datasets. Much of the interdisciplinary information is hidden in second or third order \nrelationships; visual analytics will facilitate the design of integrated spatial data assessments by unlocking \nknowledge from various domains and actors.  \n \nAlthough these entity relationship diagrams are centred on geo-spatial data, the underlying database links \nspatial datasets across different domains to numerous other entities, such as EEA indicators, projects, \ndeliverables, models, products, publications etc. Therefore, this inventory may also become an effective \nplanning tool and can be used for communication to a non-technical audience and policy makers.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(17)  https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search?any=idp_*&facet.q= \n\nstatus%2Fnotobsolete&resultType=details&sortBy=relevance  \n(18)  Elements of the DPSIR framework are: Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact and Response.

Web map services are protocols for serving georeferenced map images, which \na map server generates using data from a GIS database. Web map viewers enable spatial overlays so that \nthe datasets can be interactively explored also by project managers without GIS expertise or without \nimmediate access to a GIS software. Web map services are produced in ArcGIS desktop and visualized in \nArcGIS Online. Once a web map service is quality controlled the services are registered in the SDI and read \nin the IDP Web Map Viewer through the Contextual Data Inventory application. \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\n \n\n31 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 4--4 Screen shot from the Geospatial Environmental Accounting Portal \n\n \n \n\n\uf0b7 Explore the map viewer on the Geospatial Environmental Accounting portal (see under \nInventory/Linked data). \n\n \nThe web application offers three main functions to the user for data exploration:  \n\n1) Search for a web map service: the search uses 1) keywords (i.e. tags such as land use), or 2) topic \nnames (such as biodiversity). The keywords are also searched in the abstract of the related spatial \ndataset, which is harvested from the SDI. Hence, all datasets can be found which have e.g. Corine \nLand Cover in their abstract.  \n\n2) The user is able to visualise and explore the services identified by the search function. \nFurthermore, the selected web map can be overlaid for further exploration of commonalities \nbetween spatial datasets.  \n\n3) Once the wished services are found and explored by overlays and zoom functions, the user can \nfind all relevant semantic information of the spatial datasets when activating the info button. This \nsemantic information are combinations of technical information coming from the SDI and other \nsemantics harvested from the content management system. \n\n4.2.6 Data cubes  \n\nIn the past, the OLAP database (OLAP Cube) was used to organise and query huge volumes of geospatial \ndata. OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing; it is a computer-based technique to answer multidimensional analytical queries. OLAP tools enable users to analyse multidimensional data interactively \nfrom multiple perspectives. It experienced a strong growth in the late 90s, but it had been mainly applied \nto business data in the search for business intelligence.  \n \nThe former OLAP database has been replaced by EEA`s own data cube technique, the Joint Environmental \nData Infrastructure (JEDI). The JEDI system uses cloud infrastructure to integrate diverse data types in near \nreal time. JEDI is component based in order to accommodate flexibility and change, while new user \nrequirements are shaped over time. JEDI prepares tabular data cubes for accounting and serves these data \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 32 \n\ncubes to the Business Intelligence software Tableau. The database is a *.csv file and hence can be opened \nwith other software than the default choice of Tableau. Year to year changes or area statistics of land \nsurface processes can then be calculated and results plotted in a user friendly, attractive and interactive \nway.  \n \nThe system architecture of JEDI is rather complex using various software: Microsoft .NET for IIS (website), \nMicrosoft SQL (DBMS), FME Server and Microsoft Azure (data processing) and Microsoft SQL + Tableau \n(output) (Figure 4--5). JEDI can be accessed at http://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu for users with EEA\u2019s \nCommon Workspace credentials. \n \nJEDI reads spatial datasets into a regular grid (see section 4.2) where every cell has a unique identifier. \nThese cells become the geo-reference identifier for every other spatial dataset integrated in JEDI. Through \nthis common identifier JEDI can relate and calculate areas based on the same cell identifier. After reading \nthe geo-spatial layers, JEDI converts them into a tabular format, i.e. dimension. All, or any user selected \ndimensions, can be then aggregated within user defined spatial units. These aggregated dimensions are \nthen added into one database (a data cube) which can be directly accessed by a data visualisation software \nenvironment, called Tableau. \n \n\n \nFigure 4--5 JEDI system architecture \n\n \n\nJEDI dimensions, look up tables and cubes \n\nThe main elements in JEDI are dimensions, look up tables (LUT) and cubes: \n\n\uf0b7 Dimension: a spatial dataset distributed in a grid and ready to become part of a cube. \n\n\uf0b7 Look up table: table aimed at enriching the attributes of a dimension. \n\n\uf0b7 Cube: multidimensional database built from several dimensions and look up tables and based on a \ngrid. \n\n \nThere are three potential dimension sources: \n\n\uf0b7 ESRI Shapefile (vector) \n\nhttp://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu/\f\n \n\n33 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n\uf0b7 GeoTIFF (raster) \n\n\uf0b7 External dimension file (CSV) \n \nDimensions can be processed at 100x100m or 1x1km grid resolution. Look up tables add additional \ninformation to the dimensions in an efficient way. They can be Excel or .csv files. A LUT can be linked to \none or many dimensions, by any of the dimension fields. \n \nJEDI cubes are created by selecting a set of dimensions and choosing which fields from these dimensions \nor the related LUT should be seen in the output database. The cubes can be created at 100x100m, 1x1km \nor 10x10km grid resolution. \n \nWhen a cube is ready a Tableau *.tds file is created. This extension stands for Tableau data source file. \nThey do not contain any data, but a link to the data source, in this case the SQL database of the cube. \nWhen opened from JEDI, Tableau will show a project connected to the cube, and the different dimensions \nand measures will be available for querying and producing charts and/or maps. \n\nJEDI LEAC Cube \n\nJEDI can calculate and store several cubes, including different sets of dimensions. As for the land \naccounting, a so-called Land and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC) 2018 cube \n(http://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu/Cube/Show/22 ) has been created. That Cube contains the following \ndimensions: \n\n- Administrative boundaries for EEA-39 \n\n- Biogeographical regions 2016 \n\n- Coastal zones \n\n- CLC accounting layers 2000, 2006, 2012, 2018 \n\n- LCFs 0006, 0012, 0018, 0612, 0618, 1218. \n\nThese dimensions can be flexibly complemented with any other thematic or stratification layers thereby \nenriching the accounting information to be deducted from the data cube. This cube is the basis for the \nLEAC viewer, both the basic and advanced versions, and it is used also for the analysis of land take (land \ntake viewer). \n\n  \n\nhttp://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu/Cube/Show/22\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 34 \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n35 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n5 Tools for land and ecosystem accounts and assessments \n\n \n\u00a9 Panos Kalimeris, Environment & Me /EEA; \u00a9 Bogl\u00e1rka Gazda, Environment & Me /EEA; \u00a9 Marco Migliozzi, My City /EEA \n\n \nThis chapter describes the accounting tools and web viewers that EEA has developed. These are mainly \nproduced as interactive dashboards, so that interested users can build their own accounts or extract \nstatistics of interest. The growing number of accounting dashboards are also presented on the Geospatial \nEnvironmental Accounting portal, under the section Explore Europe in Numbers. \n \n\n5.1 Land cover and change statistics: interactive accounting dashboards \n\nAn accounting cube may be directly exploited in the Business Intelligence software Tableau, by means of \nthe creation of queries that offer tabular, chart or map results. The different dashboards that one can \ncreate in Tableau can be published on Tableau Server and can be shared as a direct URL or embedded in \nany website. The Land cover and change 2000-2018 interactive dashboard is published on EEA`s website. \nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics \n \n\n \nFigure 5--1 Land cover and change statistics, embedded in EEA\u2019s website \n \n\n5.2 Deriving accounting statistics for land cover stocks \n\nThe \u201cLand cover statistics (km2)\u201d and \u201cLand cover statistics (%)\u201d tabs in the interactive dashboard allow \nthe accounting for land cover stocks in Europe, with a breakdown for countries and with various selection \nchoices. One can select the CLC, LEAC and MAES categories on various hierarchical levels. By changing \nthese settings, the table changes accordingly displaying the chosen statistics.  \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 36 \n\n \nOne might be interested in land cover statistics in certain NUTS3 classes or biogeographical regions, which \ncan be chosen under the \u201cSelect geographical unit\u201d filter. The default geographical unit selection is \ncountries and the table below shows accordingly the land cover stock break-down per country. The column \ntotals of the table sum the country specific break down of the land cover categories and hence display the \nEuropean totals. Selecting EEA-39 or EU-28 allows the user to explore the total area of land cover \ncategories within these geographic areas at once.  \n \nThe \u201cLand cover statistics as charts\u201d tab in the interactive dashboard allows the exploration of land cover \nstock statistics in chart format. This allows the direct comparison of countries in terms of their land cover \ncharacteristics as the chart is ordered in decreasing order of area extent of the various classes. \n \n\n \nFigure 5--2 Interactive queries of land cover stock statistics in tabular formats \n \nWhile selecting CLC or LEAC categories as \u201cLand stock types\u201d will display the absolute extent of land cover \nclasses and hence larger countries will have more land cover, other land stock options allow the relative \ncomparisons. Selecting e.g. \u201cLand Cover Flows 2018\u201d as land stock type allows the direct comparison of \nland use (or natural) changes of the land stock of all countries. As before, the NUTS regions or \nbiogeographical regions may be queried instead of countries and EEA-39 or EU-28 country groups can be \nselected as well.  \n\n5.3  Deriving accounting statistics (consumption and formation) from LCFs. \n\nGeneral statistics on land cover stock or land cover change over time, by different reporting units, are one \nof the main purposes of accounting. Another important element is assessing the different land use \nprocesses that have occurred and analysing which classes have gained or lost area at the expense of other \nclasses, i.e. land cover flows. In other words, what is interesting is analysing not only the quantitative \nfigures of changes, but also the qualitative aspects (from which classes and/or to which classes a specific \ntransition has occurred). The \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 tables\u201d and \u201cAccounting for land cover \nchanges \u2013 charts\u201d tabs of the interactive dashboard provide such kind of assessments to users. \n\f\n \n\n37 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 5--3 Interactive queries of land cover stock statistics in charts \n \nSelecting level 1 Land Cover Flows in EEA-39 in the \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 tables\u201d, displays, \nfor example, that in the period 2000-2018, 24 388km2 of arable land were transformed (Consumption) \nwhereas 17 160km2 of arable land were added to the existing stock. The difference of these values \nindicates that 7 228km2 of arable land was lost. Furthermore, and importantly, the rows of the tables break \ndown these changes to the various land cover flow categories. This way one can analyse the causes for \nlosses and gains of different land cover types. With regards to arable land for example, the statistics \nindicate that major fraction of arable land loss (6 222km2) was due to the sprawl of economic sites and \ninfrastructures.  \n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 38 \n\n \nFigure 5--4 Interactive accounting of land cover stock changes in tables \n \n\n \nFigure 5--5 Interactive accounting of land cover changes in charts \n \nThe \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 charts\u201d tab adds advanced land accounting features to the \ninteractive dashboard. Firstly, in this tab statistics are broken down to the countries, NUTS regions or \nbiogeographic regions in charts and hence direct comparison is facilitated. By selecting the consumption \nor formation \u201caccounting class\u201d the user can explore gains and losses of land covers and by detailing these \naccording to the various land cover flows the (land use) drivers of changes can be analysed. Furthermore, \nby selecting all or a combination of land cover classes all these changes may be analysed in certain \nconditions according to assessment needs. \n  \n\f\n \n\n39 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n5.4  Mapping land stock and land cover changes statistics \n\nThe interactive application for land cover accounting allows the mapping of stocks and changes, \naggregated within NUTS3 and NUTS0 regions for the various periods. By selecting the observation year, \nthe hierarchy of the classification and the land cover of interest, the application will map the query. For \ninstance, in Figure 5--6arable land and permanent crops (level 1 classification hierarchy) for the year 2018 \nare mapped for the EEA-39 region (in % of the total area of the administrative unit). In case land cover \nflow is of interest, the user may select the land cover flows on a given hierarchy (thematic detail) for a \ngiven change period. Figure 5--7 shows the flow 'Increase in forest land and other semi-natural areas\u2019 \n(LCF6) for the period 2000-2018 for the EEA-39 region. The changes are shown in percentage of the NUTS3 \nregions for the purpose of comparability.   \n \n\n \nFigure 5--6 Interactive mapping of land cover stock in NUTS3 regions \n \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 40 \n\n \nFigure 5--7 Interactive mapping of land cover flows in NUTS3 regions \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n41 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n6 Implementing land accounting \n\nThis chapter aims at bringing the rather specific technical and conceptual descriptions of the previous \nchapters into a more practical context. To do so, several use cases are presented that focus on important \nland cover change processes in Europe: \n\n\uf0b7 Urban areas \n\n\uf0b7 Changes in extent and composition of agricultural land  \n\n\uf0b7 Change in forest area and composition \n\n \n\nThe chapters below take a closer look at some of the processes related to the issues mentioned above \nwith statistics, charts and maps derived from the land accounting database. \n\n6.1 Urban areas and land take \n\n \n\u00a9 Marco Migliozzi, My City /EEA; \u00a9 Toni Garc\u00eda, My City /EEA; \u00a9 David Holland, My City /EEA \n\n \nAlmost three quarter of the European population lives in cities (Dijkstra et al., 2016) with a tendency of \nthis share to increase until 2050 (Kompil et al., 2015). At the same time, also artificial surfaces are expected \nto increase (Lavalle and Barbosa, 2015).  \n \nLand take is the process in which urban areas and sealed surfaces occupy agricultural, forest or other seminatural and natural areas (EEA, 2019a). The EEA land take indicator (CSI 014, LSI 001) addresses the change \nin the area of agricultural, forest and other semi-natural land \u201ctaken\u201d for urban and other artificial land \ndevelopment (hence the name \u201cLand take\u201d). Land take includes areas sealed by construction and urban \ninfrastructure, as well as urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities. The main drivers of land take \nare grouped in processes resulting in the extension of: \n \n\n\uf0b7 housing, services and recreation; \n\n\uf0b7 industrial and commercial sites; \n\n\uf0b7 transport networks and infrastructures; \n\n\uf0b7 mines, quarries and waste dumpsites; and  \n\n\uf0b7 construction sites. \n \nIn some cases, artificial land is returned to other land categories (recultivation). The balance between \ntaken and recultivated land is net land take \u2014 the concept behind the EU\u2019s \u2018no net land take\u2019 target. This \nnon-binding commitment of the EU was stipulated in the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe and \nrepeated in the 7th Environmental Action Programme.  \n \n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 42 \n\n \nFigure 6--1 Spatial pattern of net land take in EEA-39 during the period 2000-2018 \n \nRecent data19 shows that annual net land take (see20) in the EEA-39 decreased from 922 km\u00b2/year in the \nperiod 2000-2006 to 440 km\u00b2/year in the period 2012-2018. These values can be deducted from the \ninteractive dashboards on land take accounting statistics accessible at https://www.eea.europa.eu/dataand-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment. Selecting the tab \u201cOverview statistics\u201d and choosing \u201cNet \nland take\u201d as \u201cindicator type\u201d for the EEA-39 extent, the column total for the period 2000-2006 gives \n5530.26 km\u00b2 net land take for the entire area. Broken down to yearly values, annual net land take was \n922 km\u00b2 for the period 2000-2006 (i.e. the total of 5530.26 km divided by 6).  \n \nDuring the entire period 2000-2018, land take concentrated around larger urban agglomerations (Figure \n6--1). Accounting for the land cover types affected by land take during the period 2000-2018 shows, that \n80 % of land take was at the expense of arable land and permanent crops and of pastures and mosaic \nfarmlands. This can be derived from the tab \u201cLand take processes - table\u201d by selecting the period 20002018 and the EEA-39 geographic extent. Total land take was 14049 km\u00b2 of which (i) 7098 km\u00b2 land were \ntaken from arable land and permanent crops (around 50 % of the total) and (ii) 3824 km\u00b2 land from \n\n                                                           \n(19)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics  \n(20)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment  \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment\f\n \n\n43 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\npastures and mosaics (almost 30 %). The top bar and the third bar from the bottom in the chart in Figure \n6--2 also illustrate that land take affected these two land cover types the most (see the tab \u201cLand take \nstatistics \u2013 chart\u201d in the dashboard, \u201cobservation period\u201d 2000-2018, \u201cLEAC code\u201d, Chart type \u201cLand cover \nlost\u201d and \u201cEEA-39\u201d).  \n \nWhile in the beginning of the accounting period (i.e. between 2000 and 2006) the largest drivers of land \ntake were construction activities and diffuse urban sprawl (tab \u201cLand take statistics \u2013 chart\u201d, \u201cobservation \nperiod\u201d 2000-2006, \u201cLEAC code\u201d, Chart type \u201cLand take drivers\u201d and \u201cEEA-39\u201d), this changed towards \n\u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201cindustrial and commercial developments\u201d in the following periods whereas urban \nsprawl did not play such an important role anymore between 2012 and 2018. Over the 18-year period \nfrom 2000 to 2018, industrial and commercial activities accounted for the largest share of land take \nprocesses in EU-28, ca. 3500 km\u00b2 (Figure 6--3). Urban sprawl (around 3000 km\u00b2), the establishment of \nconstruction sites (around 2700 km\u00b2) and mining (ca. 2100 km\u00b2) were further drivers of land take in \nEurope. \n \n\n \nFigure 6--2 Loss of land cover classes due to land take broken down to land take processes. EEA\n39, 2000-2018. \nSource: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics  \n\n \nTaking recultivation measures between 2000 and 2018 into account, four main processes of reusing \nformerly developed land appear: water body creation, creation of semi-natural areas, agricultural \ndevelopment and forest creation (afforestation) (see Figure 6--4), the bars that extend towards the left of \nthe y-axis). Taking recultivation measures between 2000 and 2018 into account, four main processes of \nreusing formerly developed land appear: water body creation, creation of semi-natural areas, agricultural \ndevelopment and forest creation (afforestation) (see Figure 6--4), the bars that extend towards the left of \nthe y-axis).

EEA-39, during \n\nthe period 2000-2018 \nSource: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics  \n\n \nThe interactive dashboard on \u201cLand cover and change statistics 2000-2018\u201d21 allows to analyse in detail \nthe Land Cover Flows (LCFs) responsible for the formation of artificial surfaces at national level. Opening \nthe tab \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 charts\u201d, the relevant values can be derived by selecting the \ndesired LCF period (using LCF Level 2), then choosing \u201cFormation\u201d (i.e. gain in accounting terms) and \n\u201cArtificial surfaces\u201d under \u201cAccounting class\u201d. Geographic unit is \u201cCountry\u201d, the extent \u201cEEA-39\u201d. As \ndemonstrated in Figure 6--55 to Figure 6--9, the expansion of construction sites (lcf37) together with the \nsprawl of industrial and commercial sites (lcf31) as well as diffuse urban development (lcf22) have the \nlargest impact in most of the countries. Spain shows the highest levels of artificial area formation in the \nfirst two periods 2000-2006 and 2006-2012, while Turkey climbs the ranking in each of the periods up to \nbe the country with the largest artificial surface formation between 2012 and 2018. In the same period, \nthe formation of artificial surfaces declined substantially in Spain and is only one quarter of what it used \nto be in the previous periods. \n \n\n                                                           \n(21)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics  \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics\f\n \n\n45 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 6--4 Major drivers of net land take processes broken down to land cover classes.

Nevertheless, they allow a very comprehensive tracking of trends in agricultural land area and \nof farming-related land cover trends that show the sources and losses of agricultural land area in great \nspatial detail. \n \nThe overall land area for agricultural production has decreased substantially between 2000 and 2018, \nleading to a reduction of ca 14532 km2 in the EEA-39 in this period, a loss of ca 0.6% of the initial stock of \nfarmland. However, while the consumption of agricultural land (considering both arable land/permanent \ncrops and pastures/mosaics) had its peak in the period 2006-2012, it has declined by around 25% \ncompared to the previous period between 2012 and 2018 (see Figure 6--8).  \n \n\n \nFigure 6--8 Total consumption of agricultural land during 2000-2018, by period, EEA-39 \n \nThe pattern can be explained by deducting statistics from the land accounts viewer (22) by comparing the \nareas that the various LCFs consume under agricultural land use between the period 2000-2006, 20062012 and 2012-201823. Plotting these by countries shows that the main factors behind the decline in the \n\n                                                           \n(22)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics \n(23)  See land accounts in https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics#tab\nbased-on-data.

Separating the two categories indicates that it is in particular arable land \nand permanent crops for which the consumption decreased after 2012, whereas the consumption of \npastures/mosaics remained rather stable in all accounting periods (see Figure 6--12). \n \n\n \nFigure 6--9 Decrease of agricultural land during 2000-2018, EEA-39. \n \n \n\n                                                           \ndiffuse residential sprawl\u201d, \u201clcf31 \u2013 Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites\u201d, \u201clcf37 \u2013 Construction\u201d and \u201clcf61\u201d \nand \u201clcf62\u201d.

While in Hungary, \nPoland and Portugal the main factor was converting agricultural land to forests and other semi-natural \nvegetation, in Czechia and Ireland the loss of arable land and permanent crops is to a large extent caused \nby the increase in the area of longer term fallow land and pastures (78 % and 92 %, respectively). However, \nsuch conversion into other types of (potential) agricultural lands are reversible processes and are often \npart of standard rotations of land use on farms. In Spain, the main drivers were construction and sprawl \nof economic sites and infrastructures (24). Turkish arable lands and permanent crops were affected by \nseveral drivers to an almost equal extent: irreversible processes concerned water bodies creation, urban \ndiffuse residential sprawl and sprawl of economic sites and infrastructures. The process of converting \nagricultural land to long term fallow land is however part of standard rotations, as explained above, and \nhence it is a reversible process. Nevertheless, all these processes were responsible for between 10 and \n14 % of loss.  \n \nThe largest gains of arable land and permanent crops were observed in northern Portugal, southern Spain, \nthe Baltic countries (in particular Latvia) and central Finland. While in the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia \nand Lithuania arable land was created by converting pastures, in central Finland the gains were due to \nconverting forests and wetlands into agricultural areas. In Portugal and Spain, the main reasons were the \nconversion of pastures, forest and semi-natural land. \n \nOne reason for the decreasing consumption of arable land and permanent crops is the decreasing \nconversion of agricultural land to forests and other semi-natural vegetation (50 % less area affected \nbetween 2012 and 2018 compared to the previous periods), see Figure 6-12. These figures can be retrieved \nby opening the tab \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 tables\u201d with the properly selected \u201cLand Cover \nchange period\u201d on \u201cLevel 2\u201d for \u201cAll\u201d countries on \u201cEEA-39\u201d extent.

Expansion of \nsemi-natural area on agricultural area (lcf62) reaches its highest values in the Netherlands and Spain (20002006 and 2006-2012) as well as Portugal (2012-2018). Over the full period of almost 20 years (between \n2000 and 2018), more forest and shrubland expanded to agricultural area than semi-natural areas (see \nFigures 2-3 and 6-12). Hotspots of converting agricultural land to forests and other semi-natural vegetation \ncould be observed in southern Portugal, Ireland, the Netherlands, and a region from the Baltic countries \ndown to Hungary (see Figures 2-3 and 6-12). \n \n\n \nFigure 6--11 Arable land and permanent crops gains and losses during the period 2000 \u2013 2018, EEA\n39. \n \n \n\f\n \n\n53 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 6--12 Expansion of forests, shrubs and other semi-natural areas on agricultural land during \n\nthe observation periods 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2012-2018, EEA-39. \n \nIn addition, a distinct change in the structure of agriculture-internal conversions contributed to the modest \nreduction in the overall consumption of arable land (26). While the first two observation periods (20002006 and 2006-2012) saw an almost equal share of conversions from arable land into pastures and vice \nversa, between 2012 and 2018 conversions from arable land into grassland was only half of the \nconversions from grassland into arable land (Figure 6--13).

Afforestation has taken place \nwhen new forests (i.e. broadleaved, coniferous or mixed forest) are planted or seeded on land that was \npreviously not covered by forest. Alternatively, forest re-growth can be observed on land that used to be \nforest in the recent past which has undergone some clear-felling, other management activities, or natural \ndisturbances (storms) so that it was classified as transitional woodland thereafter. Within the land \naccounting concept, both forest and transitional woodland belong to the same category as, in general \nterms, they together represent the forest land use area.  \n \nIn Europe, forest expansion on previous farmland (lcf61, representing a real gain of forested land) declined \nsubstantially between 2012 and 2018, which is one possible explanation for the decline in arable land loss \n(see previous section on agricultural land). On the other hand, this land use change process might be one \nof the reasons for the net concurrent loss of forested land in the period 2012-2018 (see Figure 6--14, \nconsumption of forest surpassed its formation). At the same time, the proportion of internal forest \nconversions, i.e. changes from one forest type into another or changes from forest into transitional \nwoodland and shrub and vice versa (represented by lcf71 \u2013 Conversion of transitional woodland and shrub \nto forest, lcf72 \u2013 Forest conversion to transitional woodlands and shrubs, and lcf73 \u2013 Conversion between \nbroadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest), to total forest formation increased from around 91 % between \n2000 and 2006 to more than 96 % between 2012 and 2018. The total values of those LCFs can again be \ntaken from the tab \u201cAccounting for land cover statistics \u2013 tables\u201d by selecting the respective period, using \n\u201cLevel 2\u201d and extracting the corresponding values of the mentioned LCFs in the column \u201cForest and \ntransitional woodland shrub\u201d for the \u201cFormation of land cover\u201d. The total formation can be read in the last \nrow under the same column. A caveat is the need for discriminating the forest-internal changes within \nlcf74. This information is not directly readable in the land accounts viewer, but has to be derived by \nseparately combining the LCF data with the CLC classes to be able to split lcf74 into changes within the \nLEAC category \u201cForest and transitional woodland\u201d and changes that do not remain within this category. \nOnce those values have been retrieved, the proportion of forest-internal changes to total formation of \nforest can be calculated easily. \n \nThis increase in the proportion of forest-internal changes indicates that most all new forest areas are, with \nincreasing tendency, not new, i.e. previously non-forest, areas, but developing out of transitional \nwoodland. Consequently, when internal conversions are becoming more important, real gains in new \nforest areas, as defined by the land accounting approach (combining forests and transitional woodlands \ninto one category), are decreasing.  \n \n\f\n \n\n55 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\nChanges in forest land cover are mainly found in a few European countries (Forest Europe, 2015). Figure \n6--15, covering the period 2000-2018, shows the relation between forest area increase and decrease (27) \nand, hence, highlights regions where forest area increase (in green) or forest area decrease (in red) \ndominate. Local clusters of regions with a dominance of forest area increase can be found in eastern \nEurope from the Baltic countries down to Hungary, else in Ireland and southern Scotland as well as in the \nIberian Peninsula. This distribution of regions with high forest area increase matches well with the \ndistribution of regions that show a significant decrease of farmland area (see Figure 6--11, Converting \narable lands and permanent crops to forests and other semi-natural areas between 2000 and 2018). \nRegions of high forest land cover decrease are clustered in Scandinavia and along the Mediterranean Sea \nfrom Croatia over Italy, southern France, Spain and Portugal.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6--14 Total consumption and formation for forests during the three periods. \n \nOne reason for the (temporary) loss of forest area is forest fires. While they occurred in the past as well, \ntheir frequency and intensity increased in the last couple of years (28). Fires mainly hit southern European \ncountries along the Mediterranean coast and in south-eastern European countries where temperatures \nhave always been generally higher. Over the full 18-year period, Portugal was most impacted by forest and \nshrub fires (Figure 6--15), with the largest damages occurring in the periods 2012-2018 and 2000-2006. In \nSpain, mainly the period 2000-2006 was concerned. Like Portugal, Italy recorded the highest consumption \nthrough fires in the most recent period, whereas Greece and Albania showed high values in the period \n2006-2012 (see period details in Figure 6--16 to Figure 6--19). \n \nA Nordic exception to the listed Mediterranean countries is Sweden, which recorded relatively large losses \nof forest and transitional woodland shrubs through fires between 2012 and 2018. The reason was the \nexceptional wildfires in 2018 caused by unusually hot and dry conditions in spring and early summer (29), \na situation that already continued in early 2019 (30). \n\n                                                           \n(27)  Afforestation is the establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land that, until then, was \n\nnot classified as forest, while natural expansion of forest happens through natural succession on land that, until \nthen, was under another land use (e.g. forest succession on land previously used for agriculture). Deforestation \ndescribes the conversion of forest to other land use or the long-term reduction of the tree canopy cover below the \nminimum 10 percent threshold.

Key EU policy documents, i.e. the Seventh \nEnvironment Action Programme and the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, set as main objectives the \ndevelopment of natural capital accounts in the EU, with a focus on ecosystems and their services, including \nland. Furthermore, work at international and European level drives forward the development and update \nof ecosystem accounting standards and related accounts. For example, the 2019 European strategy for \nenvironmental accounts describes priorities and actions to be developed for the use of environmental \naccounts in a harmonised way. For serving the European policies especially on natural capital and \nbiodiversity, enlarged production of ecosystem accounts, forest accounts, water accounts and land \naccounts have been identified.  \n \nEEA has developed land and ecosystem accounting methods for about two decades. This report describes \nthe state of the art of concepts and methods for geospatial environmental accounting at EEA and ETC/ULS, \nwhich aim to be transparent, repeatable and efficient. They are designed to facilitate the assessment of \nstatus and trends in natural capital and provide efficient input to analysis supporting environmental and \nsectoral policies. The methods presented in this report are flexible and may be used to any categorical \ngeospatial data to account for gains and losses as well as other geo-spatial analysis.  \n \nThe core data set underpinning the EEA land and ecosystem accounting system is Corine land cover but \nmany other data sets are also integrated into EEA\u2019s approach. The CLC accounting layers enable the \nconsistent assessment of land accounts for the almost 20 years period of 2000-2018. The CLC accounting \nlayers may be freely integrated with other datasets, such as biogeographical regions, administrative \nboundaries, geo-physical variables such as elevation classes, other land use information such as landscape \nfragmentation or socio-economic variables such as population density to shed light on drivers and \npressures of land cover and land use change. The EU Copernicus earth observation programme and the \nincreasing collection of geo-spatial data on ecosystems and biodiversity will increase the data sets \navailable for land and ecosystem accounting manifold. This is an aspect already taken into account for \ndeveloping EEA\u2019s future land and ecosystem accounting approach. \n \nEEA\u2019s Integrated Data Platform allows the efficient, transparent, repeatable and hence quality controlled \nintegration of geo-spatial datasets in accounting statistics. By converting geo-spatial datasets into analysisready formats, the workflow is faster and more effective than performing GIS analysis on raw data. In case \nfor example a new version of one of the input geo-spatial datasets becomes available, update of the \naccounting cubes is efficient as only the dimension in question needs to be renewed. Furthermore, as the \ndimensions are stored in the cloud environment, the use of the same inputs are ensured in case of several \nexisting versions of the same input dataset. This allows the system to deal with the increasing set of input \ndata sets as well as of analytical demands efficiently.  \n \nWith the increasing number of high spatial and temporal resolution Earth Observation images, data are \nbecoming bigger and bigger in size, in many cases reaching several hundreds of terabytes. The \nmanagement and processing of big data is therefore a necessity in order to ensure fast, efficient, up-todate and state-of-the-art policy support. This is the way forward in EEA`s future geospatial environmental \naccounting system and will allow a more versatile support to a wider range of policy questions.  \n\n \n\n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 62 \n\nReferences \n\nB\u00fcttner, Gy. and Kosztra, B., 2017: CLC2018 Technical Guidelines.

Additional information is necessary \nto identify an abandonment process (type of agriculture, landscape type, socio-economic \nstatistics...). \n\n\uf0b7 lcf62 Expansion of semi-natural area on agricultural area: Farmland abandonment in favour of \nnatural or semi-natural landscape (except forests and transitional woodland shrub, see lcf61). Some \nodd cases are recorded as lcf99 Rare or not-applicable changes. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf63 Forest creation, afforestation: Forest and woodland creation from other semi-natural, \nwetlands, water or artificial areas. \n\n \nLCF7 Forest internal land cover changes: Conversion between forest classes and / or the transitional \nwoodland and shrub class. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf71 Conversion of transitional woodland and shrub to forest: Conversion from transitional \nwoodland to broadleaved, coniferous or mixed forest, taking place when trees have reached the \ncanopy closure and heigh defined for mature forest (30% and 5-7 m in CLC in general but can be \ndifferent e.g. for Boreal forests). \n\n\uf0b7 lcf72 Forest conversion to transitional woodland and shrub: Conversion from forest to transitional \nwoodland and shrub class (CLC324). \n\n\uf0b7 lcf73 Conversion between broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest: Conversions between \nbroadleaved, coniferous and/or mixed forest (CLC311, 312 and 313). \n\n \nLCF8 Water body and wetland creation and management: Creation of dams, reservoirs, wetlands and \npossible consequences of the management of the water resource on the water surface area. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf81 Water body creation: Extension of water surfaces resulting from the creation of dams and \nreservoirs. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf82 Water body management: Shrinking of water bodies because of management or natural \nreasons. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf83 Wetland creation and expansion of peat extraction: Wetland creation and expansion of peat \nextraction. \n\n \nLCF9 Changes of Land Cover due to natural and multiple causes: Changes in land cover resulting from \nnatural phenomena with or without any human influence, plus rare or not-applicable changes. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf91 Semi-natural creation and rotation: Changes in natural and semi-natural land cover due to \nnatural factors. \n\n\uf0d7 lcf911 Semi-natural creation: Natural colonisation of land previously used by human activities. \nNote that extension of CLC324 is considered as the result of farmland abandonment or direct \nafforestation. \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 70 \n\n\uf0d7 lcf912 Semi-natural rotation without forest reduction: Rotation between the dry semi-natural \nand natural land cover types of CLC (except forest and transitional woodland shrub). \n\n\uf0d7 lcf913 Semi-natural rotation by forest reduction: Rotation from forest and transitional woodland \nshrub to dry semi-natural classes. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf92 Forests and shrubs fires: Forest and shrub fires. Due to the short cycle of recovery of vegetation \nfrom fire, burnt areas (which are well identified on satellite images) cannot be compared in a 10 \nyears interval, except for very aggregated statistics. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf93 Coastal processes: Any process of coastal erosion or accretion. \n\n\uf0d7 lcf931 Coastal erosion: Conversion of all land cover types to intertidal flats, estuaries or sea and \nocean. As the tide level when the satellite image is shot being unknown for the \nphotointerpreters, the coastal erosion flow has to be used very carefully. \n\n\uf0d7 lcf932 Coastal accretion: Conversion from intertidal flats, estuaries or sea and ocean to other \nclasses. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf94 Decrease of permanent snow and glaciers: Decrease of permanent snow and glaciers due to \nclimate change to semi-natural and natural land covers, mainly to bare rock, sparsely vegetated \nareas and water systems. \n\n\uf0b7 lcf99 Rare or not-applicable changes: In this category are recorded land cover changes that are rare, \nmore likely improbable or not applicable due to definitions in nomenclature. \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEuropean Topic Centre on Urban, Land and Soil \n\nSystems (ETC-ULS) \n\nEnvironment Agency Austria \nSpittelauer L\u00e4nde 5 \nA-1090 Vienna/Austria \nTel.: +43 1 313 04 \nWeb: http://uls.eionet.europa.eu/ \n \n \n\nISBN 978-3-200-07114-8 \n\nThe European Topic Centre on Urban Land and Soil \n\nSystems (ETC/ULS) is a consortium of European \n\ninstitutes under contract of the European \n\nEnvironment Agency. \n\nhttp://uls.eionet.europa.eu/", "A new report shows that EU\u2019s ecosystems generated an annual flow of selected seven ecosystem services at the value of \u20ac 172 billion.
