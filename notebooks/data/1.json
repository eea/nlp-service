The latest annualaddresses the issue assessing the value of travel by train and plane, amid efforts to put in place the European Union\u2019s green deal. The European Green Deal includes the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emission from transport by 90% by 2050 compared with 1990. Shifting to more sustainable transport can make an important contribution to reaching this objective. For passenger transport, a shift from air to rail travel can play a key role, the report says.\nTransport accounted for 25 % of EU greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. This sector\u2019s emissions come primarily from road transport (72 %), while marine transport and aviation represent shares of 14 % and 13 % of emissions, respectively, and rail a share of 0.4% (emissions by diesel trains only). Apart from their direct contribution to global warming and air pollution, emissions that take place during the production, transmission and distribution of energy used by trains and aircraft are also considered. Transport also causes non-exhaust emissions of air pollutants, for example from the abrasion of brakes, wheels and tyres or railway tracks.\nThe report specifically looks into the impacts of rail and air travel, both of which are a big part of Europe\u2019s passenger transport sector. The assessment concludes that rail travel is the best and most sensible mode of travel, apart from walking or cycling. Aviation\u2019s emission impacts are much higher on a passenger-kilometre basis. But the report notes that flying is not necessarily the most harmful choice. Travel by a petrol or diesel-powered car, especially if traveling alone, can be more harmful.\nThe assessment concludes that rail travel is the best and most sensible mode of travel, apart from walking or cycling.\nThe report notes however, that over longer distances, the environmental costs of travelling by air increase less because the environmental costs of landing and take-off do not change with distance on a direct flight. The assessment is based on a comparison of travel between 20 city pairs across Europe.\nA separatebased on a study commissioned by the EEA also published today, says both rail and shipping are the least carbon-intensive choices for motorised transport. Rail and waterborne transport have the lowest emissions per kilometre and unit transported, while aviation and road transport emit significantly more.\nWhile the efficiency of rail and aviation improved markedly during the 5-year period covered by the study, the efficiency of other modes appears to have stagnated. Shifting to rail and waterborne transport should be encouraged while at the same time improving the greenhouse gas efficiency of all motorised forms of transport, the briefing says.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/motorised-transport-train-plane-road or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 01:28 PM\nFiled under: aviation emissions shipping emissions rail transport european green deal transport and environment reporting mechanism waterborne transport emissions from transport road transport emissions clean transport\nFiled under: aviation emissions, shipping emissions, rail transport, european green deal, transport and environment reporting mechanism, waterborne transport, emissions from transport, road transport emissions, clean transport\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "In 2016, road transport was responsible for almost 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions from transport.\nDo something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Rail and waterborne transport have the lowest emissions per kilometre and unit transported, while aviation and road transport emit significantly more. Alongside shifting to rail and waterborne transport, improving the GHG efficiency of all motorised forms of transport remains an important objective. Moreover, monitoring their GHG efficiency on a regular basis would support these efforts. While active modes, such as walking and cycling, are outside the scope of the study, they are an obvious choice for clean and sustainable mobility because their emissions can be assumed to be close to zero.\nThe decarbonisation of transport is slow compared with that of other economic sectors such as energy supply and industry. Most other sectors have reduced their emissions significantly since 1990, while transport emissions have risen and gained in relative importance. It is, therefore, imperative to make both passenger and freight transport in Europe more efficient and less dependent on fossil fuels. Facilitating a shift towards the lowest-emission transport modes is an important part of this effort. But how do the different modes of transport in the EU (i.e. road, rail, aviation, inland waterway transport and maritime shipping) stack up in terms of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit transported? This briefing seeks to answer the question. The results presented here are from a recent study commissioned by the EEA. The study was conducted by Fraunhofer ISI and CE Delft, which had the task of developing a method for reporting on the GHG efficiency of the main modes of transport in Europe.\nOne objective of the EU and its Member States is to drastically reduce GHG emissions to achieve the objectives of the Paris agreement. This is expressed in the European Green Deal, which sets the ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. For transport, which currently accounts for 24.6% of the EU\u2019s total emissions[1], the European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction by 2050 compared with 1990. The European Commission\u2019s Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, published in December 2020, calls for \u2018decisive action to shift more activity towards more sustainable transport modes\u2019. The strategy identifies a doubling of high-speed rail traffic in Europe by 2030 and a tripling by 2050 as milestones for passenger transport. For rail freight transport, it aims at a 50% increase by 2030 and a doubling by 2050. Freight transport by inland waterways and short-distance sea shipping should increase by 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050. Reaching these milestones is expected to contribute to a reduction in the environmental pressures from the mobility system. This approach reflects the fact that some forms of motorised transport are more energy efficient and less GHG intensive than others.\nAll values presented here are \u2018well-to-wheel\u2019. This means that both the emissions from the production and distribution of fuels and those from using them are accounted for. As a next step, it would be desirable to also include the emissions from vehicle manufacturing, maintenance and recycling, as well as those related to the construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure. However, for the time being, such a life-cycle analysis is still hampered by a lack of data at European level.\nFigure 1 shows a clear hierarchy for motorised passenger travel when it comes to GHG efficiency. The relevant unit is passenger-km (pkm), which means moving one passenger over one kilometre.\nSource: Fraunhofer ISI and CE Delft, 2020\nNotes: pkm = passenger kilometre; implied car occupancy rate: 1.6\nTrains are the most efficient form of passenger transport in the EU, with GHG emissions per pkm that are only a fraction of most other modes. The second most efficient mode is maritime passenger transport. However, the value presented here mainly represents emissions from roll-on/roll-off ferries designed to carry both vehicles and passengers (RoPax). The detailed results show that emissions from other passenger vessel types, such as cruise ships, can be much higher. Taken together, buses and coaches are the most efficient form of road passenger transport. However, the uses of these vehicles vary significantly, which affects their emission performance. Passenger flights and cars are the least efficient forms of passenger transport and produce the highest emissions per pkm.\nThe results suggest that aviation and rail passenger transport efficiency improved by 12% and 13% respectively over the period from 2014 to 2018. For rail, this is mainly the result of the electrification of the rail network and the declining carbon intensity of the EU\u2019s electricity mix. For aviation, the gains owe largely to the uptake of more efficient aircraft. The GHG intensity of car travel only improved marginally over the period in question. For bus and coach travel, GHG efficiency appears to have declined.\nGHG efficiency rates for freight transport vary much more than those for passengers. So much so that a logarithmic scale was used in the left part of Figure 2. The relevant unit is tonne-km, which means moving the payload of one tonne over one kilometre.\nFigure 2: Average GHG emissions by motorised mode of freight transport, EU-27, 2014-2018\nSource: Fraunhofer ISI and CE Delft, 2020\nNote: logarithmic scale used in left chart; tkm = tonne kilometre\nEmissions for freight transported by maritime shipping, rail and inland waterway are very low compared with those for freight transported by heavy goods vehicle (HGV). Air cargo stands out as the mode with the highest emissions by far. However, over the 2014-2018 period, air cargo saw the biggest GHG efficiency improvement (12%) followed by rail freight (11%). Similar to passenger transport by air and rail, more efficient aircraft and the electrification of railway lines are behind this trend. HGVs only showed a slight improvement of 3%.\nThe results presented above fully confirm the assumptions underpinning the EU\u2019s modal shift policy. However, not all modes are equally suited to all transport tasks. Therefore, it is not always possible to substitute one mode of transport for another. Issues related to geography (e.g. transport over water), the availability of infrastructure, as well as time criticality (e.g. for express delivery or perishable goods) limit what is possible. In addition, the most efficient motorised transport modes can only be used between transport hubs such as ports and rail freight terminals and, therefore, only function in combination with other modes.\nIn this briefing, the efficiency figures are presented at the highest level of aggregation. The study itself drills down into different market segments, vehicle and vessel categories, propulsion systems and fuels. Although all values have been calculated as accurately as possible given the available data, they may be subject to revision. It is also important to understand that they can only ever be as reliable as the data underpinning them and the accuracy of assumptions, which also depend on existing data and research. Finally, the 5-year span from 2014 to 2018 is insufficient to document long-term efficiency trends. It was a conscious choice that the study would prioritise comparable and consistent data across modes over having a long time series. It is, nevertheless, important to keep track of how the GHG efficiency of modes evolves over time. As such, it is envisaged that the method developed in the study could underpin an EEA indicator with regular updates in future.\nThis is not the first time such figures have been produced. However, previously published figures are often outdated and suffer from the absence of coherent input data across modes. Another shortcoming is the often-incomplete application of a well-to-wheel perspective. All values presented above are well-to-wheel or well-to-wake, which is the equivalent expression for aviation and shipping. They are expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e) and cover the EU-27 (i.e., the 27 EU Member States as of 1 February 2020). For aviation, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) weighted emissions factor of 1.7 was applied to the direct CO2 emissions from flights to take account of the so-called non-CO2 radiative forcing effects of aeroplane emissions. The factor of 1.7 relates to a 100-year GWP and comes from a recent study commissioned by the European Commission on the topic. For maritime shipping, the climate impacts of black carbon emissions are included, in-line with the findings of the 4th IMO GHG study.\nThe results are primarily intended as a baseline for measuring progress and for informing policy choices at the EU level. However, a well-informed policy will not be solely based on GHG efficiency but will consider the full spectrum of potential environmental and health impacts. Finally, the average values presented in the briefing should not be used for calculating GHG emissions for specific trips. Emissions per km for some modes, especially for aviation, are distance dependent. Also, the GHG intensity of electricity differs significantly across EU Member States.\n[1] Excluding LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) and international maritime emissions and including international aviation and indirect CO2 emissions.\nBriefing no. 01/2021\nTitle: Rail and waterborne \u2014 best for low-carbon motorised transport\nHTML - TH-AM-21-001-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-364-1 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/817894\nPDF - TH-AM-21-001-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-363-4 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/85117\nDisclaimer\nThe country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing.\n2014-2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/rail-and-waterborne-transport/rail-and-waterborne-best or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 02:55 PM\nFiled under: mobility rail greenhouse gas efficiency emissions road\nFiled under: mobility, rail, greenhouse gas, efficiency, emissions, road\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

To assess how this has affected concentrations of air pollution, the EEA has developed a viewer that tracks the weekly and monthly average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5).\nData from EEA member countries show how concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) \u2014 a pollutant mainly emitted by road transport \u2014 have decreased in many European cities where lockdown measures have been implemented.\nAlthough a decrease in concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may also be expected, a consistent reduction cannot yet be seen across European cities. This is likely due to the fact that the main sources of this pollutant are more varied, including at European level the combustion of fuel for the heating of residential, commercial and institutional buildings, industrial activities and road traffic. A significant fraction of particulate matter is also formed in the atmosphere from reactions of other air pollutants, including ammonia \u2014 a pollutant typically emitted from the application of agricultural fertilisers at this time of year.\nOther factors, such as weather conditions, may also significantly contribute to the reductions seen in pollutant concentrations. Conversely, changes in meteorology can also lead to increased air pollution, and coupled with the often non-linear relationships between changes in emissions and changes in concentrations, also explain why lower air pollution may not occur at all locations.\nData source\nExposure to air pollution can lead to adverse health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. A number of health authorities have warned that those citizens with certain pre-existing conditions, such as respiratory illnesses, may have an increased vulnerability to COVID-19. However, at present it is not clear whether ongoing exposure to air pollution might worsen the condition of those infected by the virus. Further epidemiological research is needed to address such questions.\nThe EEA\u2019s data are measured hourly or daily, on the ground, at about 3 000 monitoring stations across European countries. The viewer shows those cities according to their definition in Eurostat\u2019s city statistics database (former Urban Audit).\nAll types of air quality monitoring stations within a city are considered. Stations can be filtered to select only \u2018traffic stations\u2019 that are close to roads. Users can also select different pollutants, countries and cities.\nThe viewer shows weekly and monthly averages for each city, in two different tabs. To produce the weekly values, a daily mean is first calculated from the hourly values for each station reported by countries to the EEA. The daily means for all stations in a city are then averaged together to produce the weekly average for that city. The same methodology is followed for the monthly values.\nThe viewer also shows the percentage change in pollutant concentrations in a city compared to concentrations in the previous week or month. Weekly averaged values are displayed to show the effect of the lockdown measures on air quality in a short period. As noted above, other factors, such as weather conditions, will also contribute to the observed changes in air pollution.\nThere are no legal standards for these pollutants on a weekly or monthly basis (for NO2 the EU standards are based on hourly and annual averages, and for PM, on daily and annual averages). The hourly \u2018near-real time\u2019 air quality measurements are also not formally verified by countries and are considered as provisional data. Gaps in the table and in the viewer represent weeks or months where data was not reported to the EEA.\nThe weeks are labelled by their starting day in the graph and tables and by their number in the filter. The values for the current month correspond to the average of the days received up to the end of the previous week.\nThe viewer is updated every Monday at 8:30 a.m.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-and-covid19/air-quality-and-covid19 or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 08:53 AM\nFiled under: air quality covid-19\nFiled under: air quality, covid-19\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "ETC/ATNI Report 12/2021: Air pollution policies and measures reported under the National Emissions reduction Commitments Directive (NECD). 2021 Update.\nThis short report describes the main characteristics of the Member States\u2019 additional air pollutant PaMs reported through the EEA PaM tool as required by Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of national emission of certain atmospheric pollutants (the \u2018NECD\u2019), since 2020.

These include policies and measures (PaMs) that the Member States are considering and \nhave selected for adoption in view of fulfilling their emissions reduction commitments. This \ninformation was required to be reported for the first time in 2019. This short report provides an update \non the data reported, with first submissions from Luxembourg and Greece, and resubmissions from \nLatvia, Hungary and Ireland. \n \nLuxembourg reported that they are considering an additional 15 individual PaMs and three packages \nof PaMs, and Greece reported 28 individual PaMs and one package. \n \nThe majority of Luxembourg\u2019s additional PaMs target the agriculture sector, followed by the transport \nsector. Luxembourg\u2019s agriculture policies include measures to reduce ammonia emissions from \nmanure application and storage, and promotion of techniques to reduce ammonia emissions from \ncattle farming. \n \nThe majority of Greece\u2019s additional PaMs target the transport sector (70 %). These policies include \nelectrification of railways, promotion of alternative fuels and improving the emission profile and \nefficiency of the road transport fleet. An additional measure, reported as targeting the energy supply \nsector, was the electrification of ships during mooring. \n \nHungary and Latvia\u2019s updated submissions did not result in significant changes to any of the analyses \npreviously undertaken. Ireland submitted an updated NAPCP in 2021, which states that the original \nNAPCP was submitted before the finalisation of a number of relevant national policy frameworks, and \nas such their additional PaMs under consideration have been updated. The main changes have been \naround the implementation dates of policies, and a higher focus on the energy consumption and \nenergy supply sectors. The majority of Ireland\u2019s policies would be implemented by regulatory means, \nwith a reduction in voluntary measures from the initial submission. \n \nThe new submissions have not resulted in significant changes to the EU-wide analysis. A total of 661 \nindividual additional PaMs have been reported, and the transport sector remains the most frequently \ntargeted by the policies. \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 5 \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis report has been prepared by the EEA European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Noise, Transport \nand Industrial Pollution (ETC/ATNI) as part of the 2021 Action plan.

Commission \nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/15222 requires these additional air pollution PaMs to be reported \nby Member States via an online webtool hosted by the European Environment Agency. This \ninformation was reported for the first time in 2019 and analysis was undertaken and presented in a \nprevious report3 and briefing4.  \n\nThis short report provides an update to this analysis. Since the analysis was undertaken two more \nMember States, Luxembourg and Greece, have reported their air pollution PaMs and three Member \nStates, Latvia, Hungary and Ireland, have provided an updated submission. All Member States except \nRomania and Bulgaria have now submitted their additional air pollution PaMs under the NECD for the \nfirst time.  \n\n  \n\n \n1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.344.01.0001.01.ENG \n2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2018/1522/oj \n3https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-atni/products/etc-atni-reports/etc-atni-report-3-2020-analysis-of-the-air\npollution-policies-and-measures-reported-under-the-national-emissions-reduction-commitments-directive-necd \n4 https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/measures-to-reduce-emissions-of/actions-to-reduce-air-pollutant \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.344.01.0001.01.ENG\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 7 \n\n2 Policies and measures (PaMs) reported by Luxembourg and Greece \n\nThis chapter describes the characteristics of Luxembourg and Greece\u2019s reported individual PaMs as \nreported through the EEA PaM tool. Luxembourg reported 15 individual PaMs and three packages \n(groups of PaMs). Greece reported 28 individual PaMs and one package. The following analysis focuses \nonly on the individual PaMs.  \n\nWhile Member States are required to report only on the additional PaMs being considered and \nselected in order to meet their emission reduction commitments, Greece has also reported on existing \nPaMs. Of their 28 reported individual PaMs 18 were reported to have been implemented prior to 2020. \nThese PaMs have been excluded from the following analysis. Of those reported with an \nimplementation date in 2020 or later, the majority were reported with an implementation date in 2020 \n(80%) with one PaM reported with an implementation date of 2021 and one of 2025. Luxembourg only \nreported PaMs with an implementation date of 2020 or later and similarly to Greece the majority are \n2020 (80 %). In addition, Luxembourg reported one PaM with an implementation date in 2022 and two \nin 2050.  \n\nGreece reported the majority of their PaMs with a default end date of \u20189999\u2019 (80 %) with two PaMs \nwith an actual end date, of 2040 and 2050. Luxembourg reported more PaMs with an actual end date, \nthe majority of these being 2030 (40 %), but 53 % of their reported PaMs were still reported with an \nend date of \u20189999\u2019. This option is available for PaMs where the end date is not yet known, as the \nadditional policies being considered may be in varying stages of development. \n\nMember States are required to report which sector(s) each PaM affected. The majority of \nLuxembourg\u2019s PaMs target the agriculture sector (40 %) with the transport sector also targeted by a \nhigh proportion of the PaMs (33 %). Luxembourg\u2019s agriculture policies include measures to reduce \nammonia emissions from manure application and storage, and promotion of techniques to reduce NH3 \nemissions from cattle farming. While Luxembourg has so far met their emission reduction \ncommitments in recent years, the reported \u2018with measures\u2019 projections show that emissions of NH3 \nare not expected to meet reduction commitments in 2020, 2025 and 2030 by 24 %, 31 % and 41 % \nrespectively. Additionally, the reported projections show that Luxembourg will miss the reduction \ntargets for NOX, NMVOC and PM2.5 by 46 %, 6 % and 16 % respectively in 20305. As the primary source \nof NH3 emissions is from the agriculture sector and a significant source of NOX, NMVOC and PM2.5 \nemissions is transport, it is expected that Luxembourg would be reporting a significant proportion of \nadditional PaMs targeting these sectors, which they have done so.  \n\nThe majority of Greece\u2019s reported PaMs target the transport sector (70 %). These policies include \nelectrification of railways, promotion of alternative fuels and improving the emission profile and \nefficiency of the road transport fleet. An additional measure, reported as targeting the energy supply \nsector, was the electrification of ships during mooring. Greece has also so far met their emission \nreduction commitments in recent years, however projections in the \u2018with measures\u2019 scenario show \nemissions of NMVOC and NOX are expected to be 3 % above the 2030 commitments6. Transport is a \nsignificant source of these pollutants; it is therefore expected that Greece is considering a significant \nproportion of their additional PaMs targeting this sector.  \n\nGreece reported that all but one of their PaMs would impact all four of the main NECD pollutants (NH3, \nNMVOC, PM2.5 and SO2) and the remaining PaM would only impact SO2. Unsurprisingly, given that the \nsectors most targeted by Luxembourg\u2019s reported PaMs are agriculture and transport, the majority of \ntheir PaMs would impact NH3 emissions (67 %) with PM2.5 the next most impacted pollutant (47 %).  \n\nLike the majority of other Member States, Greece and Luxembourg reported that the majority of their \nPaMs would be implemented through regulatory means, 70 % and 80 % respectively. A high number \n\n \n5https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/reduction_napcp/Luxembourg_Projections%20review%20report_FINAL.pdf \n6https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/reduction_napcp/Greece_Projections%20review%20report_FINAL.pdf \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/reduction_napcp/Luxembourg_Projections%20review%20report_FINAL.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 8 \n\nof PaMs from both Member States would also be implemented through economic and fiscal means. \nAll PaMs from both Greece and Luxembourg would be implemented by a national government entity, \nwith Luxembourg reporting that one of their PaMs would be implemented through both a national \ngovernment entity and a local one.  \n\n2.1 Reported effects of policies and measures under the NECD \n\nTo be consistent with the previous analyses, the following section only includes analysis on PaMs \nselected for adoption. Greece reported no PaMs selected for adoption with an implementation date \nof 2020 or later, and therefore only PaMs from Luxembourg are included (87 % of their reported PaMs). \n\nIt was mandatory to report quantified emissions reductions of additional air pollution PaMs for each \npollutant that the PaM targeted for the years 2020, 2025 and 2030. They could be reported as absolute \nvalues, a range of values or a \u2018#\u2019 sign where no quantification was available, with quantified emissions \nin kilotonnes (kt) of pollutant saved per year. All but one of Luxembourg\u2019s PaMs were quantified at \neither the single or group level.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1:  shows the reported emission reductions from Luxembourg. The highest emission \nreductions were reported for NH3 with annual reductions of 1.39 kt by 2030. This is expected as the \nmajority of PaMs are targeting NH3. Reductions of SO2 are expected to be the lowest, with annual \nreductions of 0.142 kt per year by 2030. This is partially expected as only 27 % of Luxembourg\u2019s \nadditional PaMs target SO2. However, 27 % of PaMs target NMVOC which have reported reductions \n1.239 kt by 2030, the second highest reported reductions from Luxembourg \n\nFigure 2.1: Reported emissions reductions from Luxembourg\u2019s additional PaMs (kt). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: Reported emissions reductions from Luxembourg\u2019s additional PaMs (kt) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 9 \n\n2.2 Comparison of reported climate and air pollution policies and measures \n\nPaMs could be identified as already reported under the EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) \nclimate mitigation policies, or ambient air quality (AQ) directive, using the \u2018Related to AQ/MMR?\u2019 field. \nThis field was a tick-box field with two options; however, it was not mandatory. Neither Greece nor \nLuxembourg reported that any of their PaMs reported under the NECD had been reported under the \nMMR, noting that only single PaMs with an implementation date at or after 2020 were included in this \nanalysis. However, comparison of the PaMs reported under the NECD and MMR show that it was \npossible to match 20 % and 7 % of Greece\u2019s and Luxembourg\u2019s NECD PaMs with PaMs reported under \nthe MMR, respectively. This was based on the PaM name and description reported under both \nregulations. Only one of these PaMs overlapped completely, with PaMs being reported at different \naggregations in the different reporting streams. Neither Greece nor Luxembourg reported quantified \nreductions of CO2 under the NECD.  \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 10 \n\n3 Updated PaMs reported \n\nLatvia, Hungary and Ireland reported an updated submission in 2021. Hungary and Latvia\u2019s updated \nsubmissions did not result in significant changes to any of the analyses previously undertaken, \nincluding on quantification, and therefore updated analysis for these Member States has not been \nincluded in this section.  \n\nHowever, Ireland reported overall 5 fewer PaMs in their most recent submission. There have also been \nsignificant changes to the implementation dates of Ireland\u2019s reported PaMs. In the previous \nsubmission 85 % of PaMs were to be implemented in 2019 or later. Only additional single PaMs are \nconsidered in the following analysis.  \n\nAs for the previous submission, the majority (70 %) of the PaMs yet to be implemented were to be \nimplemented in 2019. The remaining were to be implemented in 2020, 2021 and 2025. In the previous \nsubmission, the majority of the PaMs were reported with an implementation end date of 2030 (50 %). \nThe remaining are to end by 2022, 2024, 2026 and 2027.  \n\nThere have been significant changes to the sectors targeted by Ireland\u2019s reported air pollution PaMs. \nIreland submitted an updated NAPCP in 2021, which states that the original NAPCP was submitted \nbefore the finalisation of a number of relevant national policy frameworks7. Presumably, this also \napplies to the initial PaMs submission under the NECD. 10 PaMs have not been reported in the most \nrecent submission which implies they may have been discarded, and 16 PaMs have been reported with \nan updated implementation date prior to 2019. However, it is important to note that none of these \nPaMs have been reported as selected for adoption. There are also five newly reported PaMs, although \ntwo of these have an implementation date prior to 2019. The new additionally reported PaMs with an \nimplementation date of 2019 or later are targeting the energy consumption and agriculture sectors.  \n\nAs in the previous submission, the majority of Ireland\u2019s PaMs target energy consumption. However, \nwhile a low proportion of PaMs targeted the energy supply sector in the previous submission, an \nequivalent proportion of PaMs targeting energy consumption targeted the energy supply sector (40 \n%) in the current submission. No PaMs targeting the transport sector were reported in the current \nsubmission, however six PaMs in the 2020 submission are targeting this sector. Additionally, the \nnumber of PaMs targeting agriculture has also reduced.  \n\nThe changes to the proportion of PaMs targeting these sectors is primarily due to the changes to the \nreported implementation dates - of the PaMs reported in both submissions only one was reported as \ntargeting a different sector. Using the transport sector as an example, while three of the PaMs relate \nto the Clean Air Strategy and have not been reported in the most recent submission, two of the \nremaining three have been included within the submission, reported with an implementation date in \n2010 and 2012. The final former transport PaM is for the development of renewable energy in \ntransport, for which the target sector has been updated to energy supply in the most recent \nsubmission.  \n\nAs for the sector distribution, Ireland\u2019s updated submission shows large changes in the number of \nPaMs targeting the main NECD pollutants. The number of PaMs targeting NH3 has reduced from 52 % \nto 30 % and the number of PaMs targeting NMVOC, SO2 and PM2.5 has increased from 66 % to 80 %. \nHowever, as found from analysis on sectors, the most significant contribution to this change is the \nupdates to the implementation dates to prior than 2019. One PaM has been reported in the most \nrecent submission as no longer impacting NH3 emissions and one PaM will additionally impact N2O \nemissions. In addition, in the most recent submission 6 PaMs have also been reported as impacting \nCO2 emissions.  \n\nUnlike the previous submission, the majority of Ireland\u2019s PaMs will be implemented through regulatory \nmeans (60 %). Additionally, no PaMs are now to be implemented through fiscal or planning means. \n\n \n7 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/reduction_napcp/Ireland_NAPCP_Feb21.pdf \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/reduction_napcp/Ireland_NAPCP_Feb21.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 11 \n\nThe proportion of PaMs to be implemented through voluntary means has also decreased from 41 % to \n20 %.  \n\nSimilarly, to Ireland\u2019s previous submission, no PaMs were reported to be selected for adoption, with \nan implementation date of 2019 or later, and therefore no quantification of the PaMs was provided. \n\nAll of Ireland\u2019s single PaMs with an implementation date of 2019 or later were reported to have been \nreported under the MMR, whereas under the previous submission only 50 % of the PaMs were \nreported to overlap with the MMR PaMs. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 12 \n\n4 Updated EU wide analysis \n\nThis chapter presents updated figures from the 2019 PaMs analysis report. In total, 661 individual \nPaMs have been reported and the total number of PaMs ranges from 11 (Cyprus) to 72 (Belgium) as \nshown in Figure 4.1. It is important to note that there is no strict definition of a single PaM and \ntherefore Member States may differ in their approach.  \n\nFigure 4.1: Number of individual PaMs reported by Member State \n\n \n\nThe recent submissions have not resulted in a significant change to the sectors most frequently \ntargeted by the reported PaMs.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 shows transport is still the sector reported most frequently as affected by the additional air \npollution PaMs. However, the number of PaMs impacting energy consumption has increased to be the \nsecond most impacted sector; previously agriculture and energy consumption were reported to be \nimpacted equally.  \n\n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 13 \n\nFigure 4.2: Number of individual PaMs by sector \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 shows that, as previously, the reported PaMs most frequently targeted PM2.5 emissions, \nclosely followed by NOX. The number of PaMs targeting CO2 emissions has increased significantly in \ncomparison to the other wider pollutants, increasing from 57 to 80 individual PaMs.  \n \n\nFigure 4.3: Number of individual PaMs targeting each pollutant \n\n \n\nThere has been no change to the proportion of PaMs reporting the different instrument types; \nregulatory PaMs continue to be the most frequently reported instrument type (Figure 4.4). \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 14 \n\nFigure 4.4: Number of individual PaMs by instrument types \n\n \n\nThe majority of PaMs reported a national government as an implementing entity (548 out of 661 \nindividual PaMs). As found previously, with a few exceptions, all PaMs that were reported as being \nimplemented by other entities were in addition to a national government entity, Figure 4.5. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5: Number of individual PaMs by implementing entity type \n\n \n\nOf the 392 single PaMs reported as selected for adoption, 278 were reported with emission reduction \nvalues (green bars in Figure 4.6). These PaMs had emissions reductions reported for at least one year \nfor at least one pollutant, either as an individual PaM or as part of a package. 114 single PaMs did not \nhave associated emissions reductions reported (blue bars in Figure 4.6). Compared to the previous \nanalysis this represents a small increase in the proportion of PaMs not quantified. As for the previous \nreport, the highest emission reductions were reported for NOX, Figure 4.7. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 15 \n\nFigure 4.6: Reported quantification overview of PaMs selected for adoption \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 16 \n\nFigure 4.7: Reported emissions reductions (kt) of PaMs selected for adoption \n\nNote: Member States could report a range of estimated emissions reductions for each PaM, shown in the figure as low and \nhigh estimates for each year. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/12 17 \n\n \n\n5 Conclusion \n\nThis report contains information on national air pollution policies and measures (PaMs) reported by \nEuropean Union (EU) Member States under Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council on the reduction of national emission of certain atmospheric pollutants (the \u2018NECD\u2019) and \nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1522. The NECD requires Member States to report on \ntheir additional national air pollution PaMs considered and selected for adoption to meet emission \nreduction commitments. \n\nThis information was reported for the first time in 2019 and analysis was undertaken and presented in \na previous Eionet report 3/20208.  \n\nThe data analysed in this report provides an update to the initial analysis ; two more Member States, \nLuxembourg and Greece, have reported their air pollution PaMs and three Member States, Latvia, \nHungary and Ireland, have provided an updated submission. All Member States except Romania and \nBulgaria have now submitted their additional air pollution PaMs under the NECD for the first time. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n8 https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-atni/products/etc-atni-reports/etc-atni-report-3-2020-analysis-of-the-air\npollution-policies-and-measures-reported-under-the-national-emissions-reduction-commitments-directive-necd  \n\nhttps://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-atni/products/etc-atni-reports/etc-atni-report-3-2020-analysis-of-the-air-pollution-policies-and-measures-reported-under-the-national-emissions-reduction-commitments-directive-necd\f\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEuropean Topic Centre on Air pollution,  \ntransport, noise and industrial pollution \nc/o NILU \u2013 Norwegian Institute for Air Research \nP.O.

Most of the people affected live in urban areas. Road traffic is by far the most dominant source of environmental noise. The number of people exposed to high levels of environmental noise has broadly remained stable since 2012. A key commitment of the European Commission\u2019s zero-pollution ambition is to reduce the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30% by 2030, compared with 2017.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\nChronic exposure to environmental noise significantly affects physical and mental health. This indicator provides an overview of the estimated number of people in Europe exposed to environmental noise above the threshold levels set by the Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49/EC) in both urban and non-urban areas. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, exposure to these noise levels can have adverse effects on health.\nThe major source of noise pollution in both urban and non-urban areas is road traffic. According to 2017 noise-mapping data, more than 95 million people in the EU are affected by road noise levels of 55 dB or more during the day-evening-night period (Lden), and more than 65 million are affected by levels of 50 dB or more during the night (Lnight). Noise from railways and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of the overall population, but both are significant sources of local noise pollution.\nTrends are difficult to establish because of methodology-related comparability issues between the reporting years (2007, 2012 and 2017) and must be interpreted with caution. However, comparisons of 2012 and 2017 data suggest that the number of people exposed to harmful noise levels has remained stable for most sources. Small increases are observed for road, railway and aircraft noise inside urban areas, both during the day-evening-night and night-time periods. A more significant increase is observed for aircraft noise outside urban areas at night. However, as noise from aircraft affects far fewer people than road or rail traffic noise, the number of additional people affected is relatively low.\nEfforts to reduce exposure to noise from individual sources may be offset by continuing migration to urban areas, which results in increases in population, activity and traffic levels. An increased demand for passenger and goods transport also hampers efforts to reduce environmental noise.\nAs no significant decrease in the number of people exposed to harmful noise levels has been observed over time, the Seventh Environment Action Programme objective to significantly reduce noise pollution in the EU and move closer to WHO-recommended levels by 2020 has not been achieved. A key commitment of the European Commission\u2019s zero-pollution ambition is to reduce the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30% by 2030, compared with 2017.\nAbout 70 million people in the 32 EEA member countries (not including Greece or Turkey) plus the United Kingdom are estimated to be exposed to harmful levels of road traffic noise in urban areas.\nAlthough it is difficult to make comparisons between countries\u2019 urban areas, because of the use of different noise-mapping methodologies (e.g. some countries map all streets in cities, while some map only the busiest streets), it is clear that in most urban areas in Europe a large number of people are exposed to unhealthy levels of road traffic noise. At least 20% of the urban population of all countries is exposed to levels above 55 dB Lden, which is above the WHO-recommended level, while, in more than half of the countries, at least 50% of the urban population is exposed to unhealthy levels of road traffic noise. Therefore, road traffic noise in urban areas is not a problem in only a few countries, but a widespread problem across Europe.", "ETC/ATNI Report 8/2021: Status report of air quality in Europe for year 2020, using validated and up-to-date data\nThis report presents summarized information on the status of air quality in Europe in 2020, based on up-to date (i.e. prior to final quality control) and validated air quality monitoring data reported by the member and cooperating countries of the EEA. It aims at giving more timely and preliminary information on the status of ambient air quality in Europe in 2020 for five key air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2 and SO2).

The report is based on a draft by \nthe European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, \nNoise and Industrial Pollution (ETC/ATNI), written by \nSebastiaan Boschmans, Inge Mayeres and Bruno Van \nZeebroeck (Transport & Mobility Leuven).\n\nComments on the draft received from EEA member \ncountries, the European Commission's TERM advisory \ngroup (Eurostat, Directorate-General for Environment, \nDirectorate-General for Mobility and Transport, \nand Directorate-General for Climate Action) and the \nEuropean Union Aviation Safety Agency are gratefully \nacknowledged.\n\f\n5\n\nExecutive summary\n\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nExecutive summary\n\nWhy this topic now?\n\nIn a year during which millions in Europe have been \nconfined to their homes and travel activity has dropped \ndramatically, the question of whether one should \ntake the train or the plane might not seem pertinent. \nHowever, before passenger numbers started dwindling \nin the wake of the pandemic, demand for passenger \ntransport was on a steady upwards trajectory with \nby far the strongest growth seen in air travel. This \nlong-standing trend is set against the backdrop of \nthe climate crisis and persistent problems with air \npollution and environmental noise in Europe. All modes \nof motorised transport contribute to these problems \nbut to different degrees. The report's topic is also \nlinked to the question of how to achieve a green and \nresilient economic recovery. The current situation \nis an opportunity to reflect and to innovate. For \nthese reasons, 'train or plane?' remains a timely and \nimportant question.\n\nPolicy context\n\nThe European Green Deal includes the objective of \nreducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from \ntransport\tby\t90\u00a0%\tby\t2050\tcompared\twith\t1990.\t\nFacilitating a shift towards the most sustainable \ntransport modes can make an important contribution \nto reaching this objective. For passenger transport, a \nshift from air to rail travel potentially plays a key role.\n\nObjective of the report\n\nThe aim of this report is to inform decision-makers on \nthe current status and environmental impact of rail and \nair passenger travel in Europe. Furthermore, the report \nlooks at how travel choices and their environmental \nimpacts relate to the existing policy context: \nwhich factors influence the future environmental \nperformance of these modes, and which policies and \nactions can promote more environmentally sustainable \nchoices? To come to a satisfactory answer, it is vital \nto understand the environmental consequences of \ntravelling by rail and air in mainland Europe. This is \nassessed both in general and for a variety of actual \nconnections between European cities.\n\nScope and method\n\nTwenty main city pairs within different distance bands, in \ndifferent parts of Europe and with varying degrees of rail \nconnection quality are analysed in the report. In addition, \nfor each of these pairs, an additional pair of alternative \nlocations in the vicinity of the main cities that is potentially \nserved by the same railway station or airport is analysed. \nAs the car is the dominant mode of passenger transport \nin Europe and is still often seen as the default choice for \nintercity travel, even for long distances, it is included in the \ncomparison as a point of reference. To maintain analytical \nfocus and to present in-depth information in the given \nformat, the emphasis is on rail and air travel. It is not \nthe report's ambition to compare all forms of motorised \npassenger\ttransport\tin\u00a0Europe.\n\nThe external cost approach, as outlined in the \nEuropean Commission's handbook on the external \ncosts of transport (EC, 2019d), has been selected \nbecause it offers an established way of putting one \ncost figure on the emission impacts of transport on \nhuman health and the environment. Non-emission \ncost categories, such as accidents and congestion, are \nincluded in the handbook but have been excluded \nfrom the calculations in this report. It should be \nnoted that these costs can be very significant. For car \ntrips, accidents and congestion (in terms of the cost \nof delay) are the two dominant categories and much \nhigher than for rail and air travel. On account of a \nlack of comparable data, the emission costs related \nto the manufacturing of trains, planes and cars, their \nmaintenance and scrapping, and the construction and \nmaintenance of the transport infrastructure are not \ncovered in the calculations. Hence, the scope is a wellto-wheel/wake analysis, rather than a life cycle analysis.\n\nKey findings\n\nLooking at the general comparison and the specific \nresults for the city pairs, rail travel is always a sensible \nchoice. The emission impacts of aviation are invariably \nhigher on a passenger-kilometre basis. However, flying \nis not necessarily the most harmful choice. This role is \noften taken by the conventional car, if single occupancy \nis assumed. Figure ES.1 displays the emission costs per \n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n6 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\npassenger for different rail, air and car travel alternatives \ncovering\ta\tdistance\tof\t500\u00a0km.\tThe\ttransport\tmodes\t\nincluded are the five most frequently used types of aircraft, \nan\telectric\tintercity\ttrain\t(ICe),\ta\thigh-speed\ttrain\u00a0(HSR)\tand\t\nthree types of car with an occupancy rate of one person \nand four people for each type.\n\nAs indicated by the error bars on the aircraft columns, \nsome uncertainty remains over the magnitude of the \nnon-CO2  global warming effects of aviation. At the \ncentral value of the non-CO2 climate costs, travelling by \nair causes more than six times higher emission costs \nthan travelling by HSR. HSR is found to be the most \nenvironmentally friendly option because of the high \noccupancy rate. Travelling in a well-occupied diesel, petrol \nor electric car, with four passengers, also has significantly \nlower emission costs per passenger than travelling by air. \nHowever, the emission costs of only one person travelling \nin a diesel or petrol car are among the highest of all travel \nalternatives considered here. With average car occupancy \nlevels at around 1.5 people, a shift from car to rail would \nalso offer significant emission benefits.\n\nAlthough the total emission costs of rail are lower \nthan those of air, the noise costs are comparable to \nor, in the case of HSR for longer distances, higher \nthan those for air travel. For rail, the noise costs \ndepend on the distance, while for air travel they \ndo not, as they are generated during take-off and \nlanding. Considering the shares of the different cost \ncategories, for air travel the climate costs are the most \nimportant cost category. For rail, the noise-related \ncosts have the highest share.

A big shift to rail requires new \ninfrastructure. For new investment in rail to be \nenvironmentally beneficial, the environmental \npressures related to the construction (e.g. from the \nproduction of cement and steel, and the fuel used for \nconstruction) and the maintenance of the infrastructure \nmust be compensated by the reduction in \nenvironmental pressures that will be made possible by \nthe opening of the new rail link. New rail infrastructure \ncan quickly result in net GHG emission reductions if \nthe GHG intensity in the construction of the line is low \n(i.e. if it does not require many complex structures, \nsuch as tunnels and bridges), if there is a lot of traffic \ndiverted from more GHG-intensive modes of transport \nand if the occupancy rate is consistently high. However, \nmore attractive rail options may also lead to additional \ndemand for transport. This could undo some of the \nenvironmental gains from switching to rail.\n\nThe GHG emissions from aviation within the European \nEconomic Area and from the electricity used in the rail \nsector are part of the same cap and trade system \u2014 the \nEU\tEmissions\tTrading\tSystem\t(EU\u00a0ETS).\tA\tshift\tfrom\t\nair to electric rail transport would reduce the external \ncosts related to the non-CO2 climate impact of aviation, \nwhich is recognised as a source of global warming. It \nwould also reduce all other negative environmental \nimpacts (e.g. air pollution), as aviation has a relatively \nhigher impact per kilometre travelled than rail travel. \nThe effect on cumulative CO2 emissions under the \nEU\u00a0ETS\tis\trelatively\tcomplex\tto\tassess\twith\tthe\tcurrent\t\nrules and their treatment of aviation emissions. It \nwould require further quantitative analysis to draw \nrobust conclusions.\n\nFurthermore, a realistic view of how much additional \ndemand Europe's railway system can absorb is \nrequired. In the short term, passenger rail can grow \nonly modestly by increasing occupancy rates and by \noffering additional railway services on the existing \ninfrastructure, where the maximum capacity and the \navailable rolling stock allows for that. In the medium \nterm, capacity can be added by procuring additional \nrolling stock and by upgrading existing rail lines so \nthat they can support more traffic and higher speeds. \nThis can, for example, be done with modern signalling \nequipment. In the long term, entirely new rail links can \n\nbe built and very significant capacity can be added. \nAlongside more capacity, it also remains an important \nobjective to further improve the environmental \nperformance of rail travel. The continued \nelectrification of rail lines and noise mitigation are \nimportant measures in this context.\n\nAt the same time, improving the environmental \nperformance of aviation remains highly important. \nThe renewal of the fleet with modern aeroplanes and \nengines has already resulted in fuel efficiency gains. \nThe\tregulatory\tlimits\tfor\tengine\tnitrogen\u00a0oxide\u00a0(NOx) \nemissions have been tightened over time and \nindividual aircraft have become less noisy. The more \nwidespread use of sustainable aviation fuel and \nimprovements in ground operations and air traffic \nmanagement could further reduce the negative \nenvironmental\timpacts\tof\u00a0aviation.\n\nLessons learnt\n\nWhen it comes to supporting a smart modal shift, \none question is of central importance. In which cases \ndoes flying offer irreplaceable benefits for travellers \nand under which conditions can it be replaced with \nless polluting modes, such as rail? As short-haul flights \nhave a disproportionate impact on health and the \nenvironment, efforts should focus on replacing those \nflights. This is typically also the travel distance for \nwhich good, less polluting alternatives tend to be most \nreadily available or are easiest to develop. To strike \na better balance between rail and air travel, it would \nalso help to make cross-border rail travel hassle free. \nIntegrated booking and ticketing across Europe would \ngo a long way towards achieving this goal.\n\nRail and aviation should be complementary, as \nthey have distinct advantages and disadvantages \nin what they offer. The findings of this report imply \nthat aviation should focus on connections where \nthere is not, or not yet, a reasonable alternative \nto flying while working towards a more integrated \nrailway network across Europe. Rail and aviation also \noffer the potential for multimodal trips, whereby \na trip combines air transport on one leg and a \nrailway trip on another leg, rather than travelling \nthe whole distance by air. For this to happen, \nmajor airports need to be connected to the HSR \nnetwork. It is also important that choosing rail is \nnot just an environmentally sound, but also a more \naffordable,\u00a0choice.\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n8 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nAs is apparent from some sections of the report, there \nis a certain imbalance between the information and \nstudies available on the environmental impacts of \nrail and aviation. Looking at the scientific literature, \naviation has so far attracted more research interest \nin its environmental impact. Especially for embedded \nemissions from vehicle manufacturing and operational \nprocedures and their impacts, rail is not well captured \nin the literature. Addressing this imbalance would \nhelp support decision-makers who are looking to \nunderstand and encourage modal shift. The relative \nlack of publicly accessible, harmonised data on rail \npassenger numbers also makes the comparison more \ndifficult. It would be useful if official statistics in Europe \ncaptured the number of people travelling between the \nmain European railway stations.\n\nEven when good alternatives to air travel are \navailable, it is also necessary that people make a \nconscious choice for every longer trip and consider \nall available transport options \u2014 regarding not just \ntheir financial costs but also their environmental \ncosts. Making reliable and consistent environmental \ninformation available is vital. A standardised way \nof comparing the environmental performance of \nthe transport modes available for making a certain \ntrip would be an important step forward. Finally, a \nbroad-based shift towards rail requires a long-term \nperspective, integrated planning at the European \nlevel and rail transport capacity to match the future \ndemand that such a shift will entail.\n\f\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n(1)\t HSR\trefers\tto\trail\tservices\toperating\ton\tspecifically\tdesigned\tlines\twith\ta\tmaximum\toperating\tspeed\tof\tat\tleast\t250\u00a0km/h\tand\tservices\toperating\t\non\tconventional\tlines\twith\ta\tmaximum\toperating\tspeed\tof\tat\tleast\t200\u00a0km/h.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe EU and governments around the world have \nadopted the United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda for \nsustainable development (UN, 2015b) and the Paris \nAgreement on climate change (UN, 2015a). The recently \nadopted European Green Deal forms part of the \nEuropean Commission's strategy to implement the \nUN\u00a02030\tagenda\tand\tthe\tSustainable\tDevelopment\t\nGoals (SDGs). The ambition is to achieve climate \nneutrality by 2050. Every sector should contribute. For \nthe transport sector the Commission's communication \non the Green Deal sets out the need to reduce \ntransport\temissions\tby\t90\u00a0%\tby\t2050\t(compared\twith\t\n1990) (EC, 2019b). The recent proposal by the European \nCommission for the next multiannual budget, entitled \n'A recovery plan for Europe', is also geared towards \nenabling a green and digital transition (EC, 2020e).\n\nThe European aviation environmental report 2019 \nindicates that the aviation sector causes substantial \nenvironmental problems in terms of climate impacts \nand local environmental problems (EASA et al., 2019). \nMoreover, although environmental efficiency is \nexpected to improve further in the future, air travel \nis also forecast to grow \u2014 although the timeline and \nthe rate of growth have become more uncertain on \naccount of the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 leading to an \nexpected increase in the local and global environmental \nimpacts of air travel. Although actions can be \nundertaken by the aviation sector itself to reduce its \nenvironmental impacts, a shift to less polluting modes \nis central to reducing the environmental footprint \nof travel. Scenarios calculated by the International \nEnergy Agency (IEA) indicate that limiting the global \naverage\ttemperature\tincrease\tto\tbelow\t2\u00a0\u00b0C\talso\t\nrequires the substitution of intra-continental flights on \nmedium\tdistances\tof\tup\tto\t1\u00a0000\u00a0km\twith\thigh-speed\t\nrail\u00a0(HSR)\u00a0(1) (IEA, 2017).\n\nThere is also a growing awareness among citizens \nof the environmental and climate problems caused \nby air transport, with some of them being ready to \nreconsider their travel behaviour, for example by \nshifting\tfrom\tplane\tto\ttrain\tfor\ttheir\ttravel\t(EIB,\u00a02020).\t\nMoreover, within the context of the COVID-19 \npandemic, environmental requirements or reducing \ncompetition with HSR, for example by cutting relatively \nshort distance domestic routes or imposing a minimum \nprice for air tickets, are mentioned as a condition \nfor state aid for airlines. Examples can be found in \nFrance (RailExpress, 2020), Austria (Gr\u00fcll, 2020) and the \nNetherlands (Morgan, 2020a).\n\nFor medium to longer distance passenger travel up to \n1\u00a0000\u00a0km\twithin\tmainland\tEurope,\twhich\tis\tthe\tmain\t\nscope of this report, people have different options \nbesides air transport: rail (including HSR), coach and \ncar. To varying degrees these modes are substitutes \nfor air transport in this market segment. This report \nfocuses on rail and air passenger transport. In addition \nto being substitutes, they also offer potential for \nmultimodal trips, whereby a trip combines air transport \non one leg and a railway trip on another leg, rather \nthan travelling the whole way by air.\n\nThe aim of the report is to get a better insight into the \nfollowing questions:\n\n\u2022 What are the environmental consequences of \ntravelling\tby\trail\tand/or\tair\ttransport\tfor\tmedium-\u00a0to\t\nlong-distance travel in mainland Europe? This is \nassessed both in general and for a selection of 20 \ncity pairs in Europe.\n\n\u2022 How are these choices and their environmental \nimpacts affected by the existing policy context?\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n10 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n\u2022 Which factors influence the future environmental \nperformance of these modes and which policies \nand actions can promote a more environmentally \nsustainable modal choice?\n\nThe structure of the report is as follows. First, \nChapter 2 gives an overview of the evolution of \nrail and air transport in Europe and their market \nshare and projected evolution, referring also to the \nuncertainties created by the COVID-19 crisis. The \nchapter also sketches the broader context of these \ntwo sectors. Next, Chapter 3 describes the main \nenvironmental impacts of rail and air transport \nand presents evidence on the magnitude of these \nimpacts as well as their evolution over time. Then, \n\nChapter\u00a04\tprovides\tan\toverview\tof\tthe\trelevant\tEU,\t\nnational and international policies concerning rail \nand air transport and their environmental impacts. \nChapter\u00a05\tgives\tfurther\tinsight\tinto\tthe\tenvironmental\t\ncosts of travelling by rail and air, based on the \nanalysis of specific city pairs. In addition, it discusses \nthe environmental gains that could be obtained by \na modal shift from air to rail. Special attention is \ngiven to the role played by the EU Emissions Trading \nSystem (ETS). Finally, Chapter 6 discusses how \nfuture developments are expected to change this \npicture and which actions and policies can play a \nrole in improving the environmental sustainability of \nmodal\u00a0choices.\n\nBox 1.1  Country groupings\n\nThroughout the report, abbreviations are used to refer to specific country groupings.

A substantial share of air travel and flights is national \nor intra-EU, market segments for which rail can be an alternative.\n\n\u2022 While high-speed rail has an impact on the number of seats offered, there is mixed evidence for how this affects the \nnumber of flights, which is most relevant from an environmental point of view.\n\n\u2022 Evidence\tshows\tthat\t4\tyears\tafter\tthe\tintroduction\tof\thigh-speed\trail\t10-20\u00a0%\tof\tdemand\tis\tnew,\tinduced,\tdemand,\twith\t\nvariations across routes.

Figure 2.1 presents \nthe evolution of rail and air transport in the EU-27 \nbetween 1995 and 2018. For rail transport a distinction \nis made between HSR and 'conventional rail transport'. \nWhen considering this figure, it should be noted that \nthe market segments covered are not completely \ncomparable between rail and air: the data for rail \ntransport also cover shorter distance daily travel, for \nwhich air travel is not an alternative, and the data for \nair transport cover also long-haul flights, for which rail \ntravel is not an alternative.\n\f\nPassenger rail and air transport in Europe\n\n12 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n2.2 Passenger rail transport in Europe\n\nPassenger-km by HSR (the total of domestic and \ninternational travel) in the EU-27 has grown by \n283\u00a0%\tsince\t1995\tand\tby\t114\u00a0%\tsince\t2000,\twith\t\nthe highest growth rates in the period up to 2001. \nRail passenger-km travelled via HSR rose from \nabout 33 billion passenger-km in 1995 to 126 billion \npassenger-km in 2018 (Figure 2.1).

The report describes it as 'an \nineffective patchwork of poorly connected national \nlines' and points to a lack of a realistic long-term plan \nto connect the different parts of the existing network \n(ECA, 2018).\n\nSince 2010, the supply of night train services has \nbeen reduced significantly. Still, a 2017 study for the \nEuropean Parliament indicates that there is a potential \n\ndemand for night train services (Steer Davies Gleave \nand Politecnico di Milano, 2017). Recently, some \nservices have been (re)introduced or existing services \nhave been expanded (e.g. by \u00d6BB, Regiojet, Leo Express \nand Sn\u00e4llt\u00e5get).

To varying \ndegrees these modes of transport can replace, or \nsubstitute for, each other in this market segment. \nIn general, people's choice will depend on many \nfactors, which also apply when one considers the \nchoice between rail and air travel, on which this \nreport focuses. The main factors determining the \nchoice are price, travel time, travel time reliability, \nfrequency of the connections and other factors such \nas convenience, comfort and safety (Givoni and \nDobruszkes,\t2013;\tClewlow\tet\tal.,\t2014;\tSavelberg\t\nand de Lange, 2018). For example, HSR is found to \nbe a good substitute for air transport for trips up \nto 2.5 or 3 hours, but less so for longer travel times \n(Jiang\tand\tLi,\t2016).\tThe\textent\tto\twhich\teach\tof\tthe\t\nfactors plays a role depends, however, on the travel \npurpose (business, leisure) and on the preferences \nof the person who travels. For example, Behrens and \nPels (2012) find for the London-Paris market, business \npassengers are more sensitive to total travel time \n\f\nPassenger rail and air transport in Europe\n\n17Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nand weekly frequency than leisure travellers and are \nless sensitive to fares. People in both the business and \nleisure market segments make a trade-off between \nvarious trip attributes. In both segments, for example, \nlonger average travel time by rail may be offset by \nhigher frequency and/or lower fares. The substitution \nbetween rail and aviation is explored further in \nSection\u00a02.4.2,\tfor\tthe\tspecific\tcase\tof\tHSR.\n\nIn addition to being substitutes, rail and air also offer \nthe potential for multimodal trips. In that case a trip \ncombines air transport on one leg and a railway trip \non another leg, rather than travelling the whole way \nby air. In this respect the 2011 Transport White Paper \nstates that all major airports should be linked to the \nrailway network. Furthermore, the Trans-European \nTransport Network (TEN-T) Regulation \u2014 Regulation \n(EU) No 1315/2013 \u2014 stipulates that until 2030 the \nmost important core network components, including \nurban nodes and airports, are expected to have \nmultimodal links, as long as they are economically \nviable, environmentally sustainable and feasible.\n\n2.4.2 The impact of high-speed rail on air travel \nsupply\u00a0and demand\n\nA number of studies have tried to identify the impact \nof HSR on air travel supply and demand in Europe. \nDobruszkes et al. (2014) analysed the impact of HSR on \nthe air services supplied (in terms of number of seats \nand number of flights). They looked at a wide range of \n161 city pairs in Europe where HSR competes with air. \nMost of these are domestic routes (in France, Germany, \nItaly and Spain) and 36 are international routes. They \nfound that shorter HSR travel times mean fewer air \nservices and that the number of flights and seats \noffered are affected similarly. This impact diminishes \nquickly between 2 and 2.5 hours of HSR travel time. \nAlbalate et al. (2015) also found an impact of HSR on \nair services in Europe, but they concluded that flight \nfrequencies are not reduced significantly, while the \nnumber of seats provided by airlines are, which is \ndifferent from the finding of the previous study. Hub \nairports have seen a larger reduction in air services \nthan non-hub airports, with a larger reduction in hub \nairports that have no on-site HSR station. Dobruszkes \net al. (2014) found that HSR frequency has only a small \nimpact on air services. Considering airline strategies, \nthe number of air services increases with the presence \nof airline hubs. In this case there may be a role for rail \nto replace short-haul flights to feed long-haul flights, for \nwhich Albalate et al. (2015) also offer some evidence.\n\nThe impact on emissions will depend on what will \nhappen with the slots that are freed up as a result of \nthe initial reduction in air services and to what extent \nadditional long-haul trips are made. Moreover, the \nmodes chosen for trips from and to the station may be \ndifferent for HSR stations in city centres compared with \nthose located near airports (Dobruszkes et al. (2014)).\n\nEvidence on the impact of HSR services on travel \ndemand (rather than supply) for a wide range of routes \nis more difficult to collect, as many studies consider \nonly specific routes. Moreover, econometric analyses \nthat also try to identify the impacts of changes in socioeconomic factors, prices, etc., are not widely available. \nThe literature review by Givoni and Dobruszkes (2013), \nwhich also covers regions outside the EU, finds that, \nsome\t4\tyears\tafter\tthe\tintroduction\tof\tHSR,\t10-20\t%\tof\t\ndemand for HSR travel is new, induced, demand, with \nvariations across routes. The other HSR travellers are \npeople who switch from a different mode. The main \nmode of origin depends on the routes considered, the \nimportance of the modes before the introduction of the \nHSR and the mode characteristics. The review finds that \nthe main modal shift is from conventional rail to HSR, \nbut that for particular routes the shift from air can be \nlarge (e.g. for the London to Paris/Lille/Brussels route \nor the Madrid-Seville HSR line). Considering the modal \nshares before and after the introduction of HSR (and \ntaking into account induced demand), air transport loses \nmost market share. For HSR travel times up to 3.5 hours, \nHSR\tmay\thave\ta\tmarket\tshare\tof\t50\t%\tor\tmore\tin\tthe\t\nrail-air market. Of course, these impacts on demand \nalso interact with the supply impacts discussed in the \nprevious paragraphs.\n\nClewlow et al. (2014) analysed the determinants of air \npassenger traffic between 90 airport pairs in France, \nGermany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom from \n1995 to 2009. Taking into account the influence of other \nfactors, such as gross domestic product (GDP), fuel \nprice, hub status of the airport and population density, \nthey found that air transport between domestic city \npairs is reduced when HSR is present in the market. \nThe substitution between rail and air is found to also \ndepend on variations in city and airport characteristics. \nFor non-domestic intra-EU travel the presence of HSR \nalso reduces air travel, but not as strongly. The authors \npoint to the fact that in this case city pairs are less likely \nto be within a distance for which HSR may be an option. \nThe presence of low-cost carriers is found to have a \nsignificant positive effect on intra-EU air travel, leading \nto a substantial net increase in passenger-km travelled. \nThis indicates that a system-wide perspective is required.\n\f\nPassenger rail and air transport in Europe\n\n18 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nWorldwide HSR activity (measured in passenger-km) \nis\thighest\tin\tChina,\tfollowed\tby\tthe\tEU\tand\tJapan.\t\nTogether\tthey\taccount\tfor\t95\t%\tof\tpassenger-km\t\ntravelled by HSR. In 2018, China alone accounted for \n71\u00a0%\t(UIC,\t2020b).\tIn\tJapan,\tthe\tcountry\twith\tthe\tlongest\t\ntradition in HSR, the market share of HSR has always \nbeen larger than that of air transport for routes of less \nthan 600 miles (960 km) (Albalate et al., 2015). This \nis linked to high frequency, attractive fares, stations \nlocated close to city centres and the attention given \nto safety, reliability and punctuality. For example, for \nthe 550 km long Shinkansen route between Tokyo \nand Osaka, ECA (2018) reports an average delay of \n\nonly\t24\tseconds.\tJiang\tand\tLi\t(2016)\tfurther\texplore\t\nthe larger market share of low-cost air carriers in \nEurope\tcompared\twith\tJapan\tand\tpoint\tto\tthe\tfollowing\t\ndifferences: (1) HSR was already well established in \nJapan\tbefore\tthe\tarrival\tof\tlow-cost\tcarriers,\twhereas\t\nin\tEurope\tthey\temerged\tin\tthe\tsame\tperiod;\t(2)\tEurope\t\nspans a larger area and has more polycentric city \ndevelopment, which creates more opportunities for \nlow-cost carriers and makes it more difficult to provide \nHSR\tservices\tefficiently;\tand\t(3)\tthere\tis\ta\tdifference\t\nin regulatory environment and market conditions, \nwith a relatively more open market attitude in Europe, \naccording to the authors.\n\f\n19\n\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n3 The environmental impacts of rail \nand\u00a0air\u00a0transport\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 Environmental pressures arise from activities related to passenger rail and air transport. These include the operation \nof trains and aircraft, the supply of energy, the transport of travellers to and from the railway station or airport, the \nauxiliary operations, the up-and-down stream process and maintenance for the trains and aircraft and the construction \nand maintenance of the infrastructure.\n\n\u2022 In addition to negative impacts from air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and noise, both modes of transport also \ncause soil and water pollution and habitat damage and produce waste.\n\n\u2022 The total environmental costs in the EU-28 of air pollution, climate change, well-to-tank emissions and noise caused \nby\tflying\tare\tsubstantially\thigher\t(EUR\u00a032.7\tbillion\tfor\ta\tselection\tof\t33\tairports)\tthan\tthose\tcaused\tby\trail\tpassenger\t\ntransport\t(EUR\u00a07.8\tbillion).\tFor\trail\ttransport,\tthe\tnoise\tcosts\tand\tcosts\trelated\tto\twell-to-tank\temissions\tare\tthe\tmost\t\nimportant.

This chapter gives a general overview of \nthe environmental impacts of the two modes. \nThe\u00a0environmental\tpressures\t(indicated\tin\tlight\tgrey\t\nin Table 3.1) arise from various activities related \nto rail and air transport. Although the categories \n\nof impacts and activities are largely similar for rail \nand air, in general the magnitude of the impacts is \ndifferent. For some of these impacts and activities \nrail has a better environmental performance than \naviation, while for others the opposite is the case or \nthe comparison depends on the specific case that \nis considered, as will be discussed further in this \nchapter for the categories indicated in dark grey \nin\u00a0Table\t3.1.\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n20 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nTable 3.1  Overview of activities related to rail and air transport and their environmental impacts\n\nRail Air\n\nCl\nim\n\nat\ne \n\nch\nan\n\nge\n\nA\nir\n\n p\nol\n\nlu\nti\n\non\n\nN\noi\n\nse\n\nSo\nil \n\nan\nd \n\nw\nat\n\ner\n p\n\nol\nlu\n\nti\non\n\nH\nab\n\nit\nat\n\n d\nam\n\nag\ne\n\nVi\nsu\n\nal\n in\n\ntr\nus\n\nio\nn\n\nW\nas\n\nte\n\nEnvironmental\timpacts\tof\ttrain\trides\tand\tflights\t(Section\t3.2)\n\nTrain/air travel\nTrain operations\n\nTake-off and landing\nClimbing out\nCruising\nApproach\n\nEnergy production, \ntransmission, distribution\n\nElectricity generation, \ntransmission and distribution\nDiesel refining and \ndistribution\n\nJet\tfuel\trefining\tand\t\ndistribution\n\nEnvironmental\timpacts\tof\trelated\tactivities\t(Section\t3.3)\t\n\nTravel to/from stations and airports and system operation\n\nTransport to/from station/\nairport (Section 3.3.1)\n\nTransport to/from railway \nstations\n\nTransport to/from airports\n\nRail/airport operations \nIdling\nAuxiliaries\nShunting\n\nAuxiliary power unit\nStart-up\nTaxiing\n\nVehicles\n\nUp-and-down stream process \n(Section 3.3.2)\n\nManufacturing of trains and \npropulsion system and end \nof life\n\nAircraft and engine \nmanufacturing and end of life\n\nMaintenance Train maintenance\nAircraft and engine \nmaintenance\n\nInfrastructure\n\nConstruction\t(Section\u00a03.3.2)\nConstruction of stations and \ntracks\n\nConstruction of airport and \nrunway, taxiway, tarmac and \nparking\n\nOperation and maintenance \n(Section\u00a03.3.3)\n\nOperation and maintenance \nof stations and tracks\n\nOperation and maintenance \nof airport\n\nDe-icing of aircraft and \nrunways\n\nOperation and maintenance \nof ground support equipment\n\nNote:\t Light\tgrey,\tenvironmental\timpacts;\tdark\tgrey,\tmain\timpacts\tdiscussed\tin\tdetail.\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n21Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nFor the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and \nair pollutants, where possible, both well-to-tank (WTT) \nand tank-to-wheel emissions (TTW) emissions are \nconsidered. The latter are also called tank-to-wake \nemissions in the case of aircraft. The TTW emissions \nrefer to the exhaust emissions that take place during \nthe operation of the train or aircraft, while the \nWTT emissions take place during the production, \ntransmission and distribution of the energy used by \ntrains and aircraft. A well-to-wheel/well-to-wake (WTW) \napproach considers both type of emissions. Transport \noperations also cause non-exhaust emissions of air \npollutants, for example from the abrasion of railway \nlines or wheels and tyres. The life cycle analysis (LCA) \nperspective also considers energy and emissions \ninvolved in the construction and maintenance of the \ninfrastructure, the manufacturing of the vehicles and \nend-of-life aspects (Figure 3.1).\n\nThe next paragraphs first give an overview of the \nenvironmental impacts of train rides and flights. Next, \na number of other impacts are discussed, including \n\nthe impacts of travel to and from airports and stations, \nthe impacts of the construction and operation of rail \nand aviation infrastructure, and the impacts of the \nup-and-down stream processes of vehicles. Although \nthe chapter presents information on the evolution of \nthe total environmental impacts, the main aim is to \nprovide insights into how these two modes compare \nwith\teach\u00a0other.\n\n3.2 Environmental impacts of train \nrides and flights\n\n3.2.1 Climate change\n\nIn\t2018,\ttransport\taccounted\tfor\t24.6\u00a0%\tof\tGHG\t\nemissions\u00a0(2) in the EU-27.

Apart from these, TTW emissions from rail \nand air transport also lead to indirect GHG emissions as \na result of the production, transport and transmission \nof the fuels and electricity that they consume. These \nemissions are called WTT emissions.\n\nRail transport\n\nFor rail transport the TTW GHG emissions are \ndetermined by rail travel demand in combination with \nother factors, including the following:\n\n\u2022 the specific energy consumption of the passenger \ntrains\t(energy\tper\tvehicle-km);\n\n\u2022 the\tnumber\tof\tpassengers\ton\tthe\ttrains;\n\n\u2022 rail\ttraffic\tmanagement\tprocedures;\n\n\u2022 the GHG emission intensity of energy consumed \nby\u00a0rail.\n\nThe specific energy consumption of the passenger trains \nincreases with the train size and weight and depends \non the speed and powertrain type. Other things being \n\nequal, electric trains are more energy efficient than \ndiesel trains. For the market segments considered in \nthis\treport,\telectric\ttrains\tare\tthe\tmost\u00a0relevant.\n\nThe energy statistics do not allow distinctions to \nbe made between passenger and freight transport \nor between different distance bands. According to \nEurostat, between 2000 and 2018 the consumption \nof oil and petroleum products by rail in the EU-27 \n(for the total of passenger and freight rail) more than \nhalved.

Although the outlook was \nproduced before the COVID-19 outbreak, it still gives an \nindication of the potential GHG reduction challenges ahead \nunder various scenarios.

In the high-demand forecast, the emissions \nare\t61-85\u00a0%\thigher\tin\t2040\tthan\tthey\twere\tin\t2017.\n\nIn addition to CO2, aviation also emits short-lived \nclimate forcers, including sulphur dioxide (SO2), \nnitrogen oxides (NOx) and black carbon, leading to \nchanges in the radiative forcing in the atmosphere. \nSuch pollutants can have both global warming and \ncooling effects, with the net effect being warming. \nIn addition, sulphate aerosols and water vapour can \nlead to contrails and cirrus cloud formation, and \nthereby contribute to net climate warming. Unlike CO2 \nemissions, the non-CO2 effects differ as a function \nof the flight altitude, time of day, weather, location, \netc. (Scheelhaase et al., 2016). In the recent update of \nthe handbook on the external costs of transport, the \nEuropean Commission (EC, 2019d) estimated that the \nnon-CO2 effects of aviation contribute about half of the \nclimate warming impact of aviation. The uncertainty \nabout the non-CO2 impacts is larger than for CO2, \nespecially for cloud-induced impacts (Lee, 2018). A \nrecent report by EASA (2020c) fully confirmed the \nimportance of non-CO2 climate impacts from aviation. \n\nFigure\t3.4\t Aviation\tGHG\temissions\tin\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tand\tthe\ttop\t10\temitters\tin\taviation\t(2013-2019)\n\nNotes: For\tthe\tperiod\t2013-2019,\tonly\tflights\twithin\tthe\tEuropean\tEconomic\tArea\twere\tunder\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS.\tFlights\tbetween\tthe\tcontinental\t\nEuropean Economic Area and its outermost regions were also exempt.\n\nSource: EEA.\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0\n\nMtCO2e\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nOthersKLMVueling Airlines, S.A.Eurowings GmbHWizz Air\n\nSASAir FranceBritish AirwaysDeutsche Lufthansa AGEasyjetRyanair\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n25Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n3.2.2 Air pollution\n\nFigure 3.5 presents the contribution in 2018 of rail \n(diesel trains) and air transport to the emissions of air \npollutants for all of the 32 member countries of the EEA \nas\tof\t1\u00a0February\t2020\t(EEA-32).\n\nRail transport\n\nRail transport generates TTW emissions of air \npollutants via the operation of diesel trains. Both diesel \nand electric trains also cause non-exhaust particulate \nmatter (PM) emissions via the abrasion of powerlines, \nwheels on tracks and brakes. The share of diesel trains \nin total emissions in the EEA-32 is limited. The WTT \nemissions caused by the production and transmission \nof electricity for electric trains, which are more relevant \nfor the market segments considered in this report, are \nnot included in Figure 3.5, as they are not reported \nseparately in the emission inventories.\n\nAir transport\n\nAir transport emits several air pollutants during \ntaxiing, take-off and landing, and cruising at altitude. \n\nThe TTW emissions of air pollutants by aviation are \ndetermined by the evolution of air transport demand in \ncombination with additional factors, including:\n\n\u2022 the energy efficiency and the abatement \ntechnologies\tof\tthe\taircraft;\n\n\u2022 the\toccupancy\trate\tof\tthe\taircraft;\n\n\u2022 air traffic management and operational measures.\n\nThe share of aviation in the total emissions of air \npollutants in the EEA-32 is relatively small.

These are the emissions related to the \nproduction and transport of jet fuel. These emissions \noccur at locations other than where the transport \nactivities take place and hence have a different impact \non health and the environment.\n\nImpacts of air pollution\n\nThe health impacts of air pollutants depend on several \nfactors, including the altitude at which pollutants are \nemitted. The largest health effects are related to air \npollution concentrations at ground level in areas with \na high population density. The concentration levels \ndepend on the emissions of air pollutants by the different \nsectors, atmospheric transformations and meteorological \nconditions. Emissions at higher altitudes of SOx, NOx \nand black carbon also lead to climate change impacts \n(see Section 3.2.1). Air pollution also leads to damage to \nmaterials and buildings, crop losses in the agricultural \nsector and adverse impacts on nature and biodiversity.\n\n3.2.3 Noise impacts\n\nRail transport and aviation are the second and third \nsources of environmental noise in Europe. Rail has an \nimpact during the entire trajectory, while the impacts of \nair traffic mostly occur during LTO. Data submitted by \ncountries\tunder\tthe\tEnvironmental\tNoise\tDirective\u00a0(END)\t\n(EU, 2002) give an insight into noise exposure for roads, \nrailways, airports and industry within agglomerations, \nas well as for major roads, major railways and major \nairports outside agglomerations.\n\nRail transport\n\nAbout 20 million people in the EEA-32 (excluding \nTurkey) are estimated to be exposed to rail traffic \nnoise of at least 55 decibels (dB) during the \n\nday-evening-night period (day-evening-night-level \nindicator of noise \u2014 Lden) (Figure 3.6). Half of these \npeople are exposed within urban areas and the other \nhalf outside urban areas. Nearly 16 million people \nare\taffected\tby\tnight-time\trail\tnoise\tof\t50\u00a0dB\tLnight \n(night-level indicator of noise) and higher, of which \n8.6\u00a0million\tpeople\toutside\turban\tareas.\tThis\tmeans\t\nthat\tabout\t4.3\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tpopulation\tis\taffected\tby\t\nrail traffic noise levels that exceed the thresholds of \nthe END during the day-evening-night period and \n3.4\u00a0%\tduring\tthe\tnight-time\tperiod\t(2020b).\tThese\t\nfigures\tcover\tboth\tpassenger\tand\tfreight\trail;\tfor\trail\t\npassenger transport they do not make a distinction \nbetween\tshort-\tand\tlong-distance\u00a0transport.\n\nAir transport\n\nThe END defines air traffic noise as noise caused \nby aircraft LTOs in the areas surrounding airports. \nPopulation exposure to aircraft noise is estimated \nthrough the calculation of noise contours around \nairports, which correspond with areas in which the \nnoise exceeds a given level, and by determining the size \nof the population within these areas. According to the \ndata collected for major airports under the END, it is \nestimated\tfor\tthe\tEEA-32\tthat\tapproximately\t2\u00a0million\t\npeople in urban areas are exposed to air traffic noise \nlevels\tof\tat\tleast\t55\u00a0dB\tduring\tthe\tday-evening-night\t\nperiod\tand\t0.8\u00a0million\tpeople\tduring\tthe\tnight\tperiod.\t\nOutside\turban\tareas,\tthe\tfigures\tare\t0.9\tand\t0.3\u00a0million,\t\nrespectively (EEA (2020b), excluding UK data). The \nnumber of people exposed to air traffic noise is smaller \nthan for rail, but the annoyance response to air traffic \nnoise is larger than for rail noise at the same noise \nlevels (WHO Europe, 2018). Moreover, new evidence \nfrom the World Health Organization (WHO) shows \nthat the annoyance response to air traffic noise has \nincreased over time and is higher than indicated by \nexposure-response functions based on older data \n(EEA,\u00a02020b).\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n27Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nHealth impacts of exposure to noise\n\nWHO (2018) indicates that long-term exposure to noise \nabove certain levels can lead to non-auditory health \neffects, such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, negative \neffects on the cardiovascular and metabolic systems \nand cognitive impairment in children. Moreover, noise \naffects not only humans but also wildlife, leading to a \nrange of physiological and behavioural responses in \nanimals, which can affect their reproductive success, \nmortality risk and migration patterns (EEA, 2020b).\n\nFigure 3.6 and Figure 3.7 present an estimate of the \nnumber of people in the EEA-32 (excluding Turkey) that \nexperience health problems because of exposure to \n\nrail and aviation traffic noise (based on EEA (2020b), \nexcluding UK data). Most people are affected by \n'high annoyance' and 'sleep disturbance', for which \nproportionally more people are affected by aviation \nthan rail noise, considering the population exposed to \nthese two noise sources. Rail and aviation traffic noise \nalso lead to cases of heart disease and premature \nmortality. For these impact categories, rail affects a \ngreater number of people than air transport. In the case \nof cognitive impairment in children, evidence is available \nonly to show links with aviation noise (see EEA (2020b)).\n\nFigure 3.6 People exposed to rail and air noise and associated high annoyance and sleep disturbance\n\nNote: Data for EEA-32 excluding Turkey, 2017.\n\nSource: EEA (2020b) excluding UK data.\n\nMillion people\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\nExposure to \n\u2265 55 dB  (dayevening-night)\n\nOutside urban areas Inside urban areas\n\nExposure to \n\u2265 50 dB  (night)\n\nHigh annoyance High sleep \ndisturbance\n\nExposure to \n\u2265 50 dB  (night)\n\nExposure to \n\u2265 55 dB  (dayevening-night)\n\nHigh annoyance High sleep\n disturbance\n\nAir Rail\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n28 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nThe estimate of the health impacts made by the EEA \n(2020b) is likely to be an underestimate, as the data \ncollected under the END cover neither all areas in \nEurope\tnor\tlevels\tof\tnoise\tbelow\t55\u00a0dB\u00a0Lday-evening-night \nand\u00a050\u00a0dB\u00a0Lnight.\n\n3.2.4 Water and soil pollution\n\nRail transport\n\nTrains have an impact on water and soil pollution from \nthe abrasion of brakes, wheels, rail track and overhead \nlines as well as fuel combustion and other sources. In \nan\tanalysis\tof\tthe\toperation\tof\tthe\t7\u00a0200\u00a0km\tof\ttracks\t\nin the Swiss Federal Railways Network, Burkhardt et \nal. (2008) found an annual release of approximately \n2\u00a0270\u00a0tonnes\tof\tmetals\tand\t1\u00a0357\ttonnes\tof\t\nhydrocarbons. Friction processes were the main source \nof the release of metals. The most important sources of \nhydrocarbons were wooden sleepers treated with oil. \nLubricants from track switches and wheel flanges were \nthe\tnext\tbiggest\u00a0sources.\n\nFigure 3.7 Premature mortality, ischaemic heart disease and cognitive impairment in children due to \nexposure to rail and air transport noise\n\nNotes: Data\tfor\tEEA-32\texcluding\tTurkey,\t2017.\t(*)\tEvidence\tavailable\tonly\tfor\taviation\tnoise;\t(**)\tmortality\tdue\tto\tischaemic\theart\tdisease.\n\nSource: EEA (2020b), excluding UK data.\n\nNumber of cases\n\n2 500\n\n5 000\n\n7 500\n\n10 000\n\n12 500\n\n15 000\n\n0\n\nAir Rail Air\n\nCognitive impairment children (*) Premature mortality (**) Ischaemic heart disease\n\nAir transport\n\nJet\tfuel\tburning\tis\tone\tof\tthe\tsources\tof\tatmospheric\t\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are \ndeposited on the soil. Soil and water pollution is also \ncaused by the spreading of aircraft de-icing and/or \nanti-icing fluids during take-offs in winter time. The \npollution may extend for several hundred metres away \nfrom the runways (Nunes et al., 2011).\n\n3.2.5 Sensitive areas\n\nFinally, GRACE (2006) and Sutter et al. (2017) point out \nthat some of the impacts that have been described \npreviously may be larger in sensitive areas, such as \nmountainous regions. For noise and air pollution,  \nboth emissions and the resulting noise  \nlevels/pollutant concentrations may be different because \nof topographical and meteorological conditions. The \nimpacts of pollution may also be different in such \nareas, on account of differences in population density \nor the presence of more diverse and more valuable \n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n29Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nIncluding the other environmental impacts, and \nextrapolating to all air transport in the EU, results \nin\ta\ttotal\tenvironmental\tcost\tof\tEUR\u00a048\tbillion\tfor\t\naviation (for both passenger and freight transport) and \nEUR\u00a010.4\u00a0billion\tfor\trail\tpassenger\ttransport.\n\nFor rail transport, the noise costs and costs related \nto WTT emissions are the most important. The WTT \ncategory that is reported includes the costs from the \nWTT emissions of both GHG and air pollutants. Although \nhigh-speed\trail\t(HSR)\taccounts\tfor\tabout\t27\u00a0%\tof\tEU-28\t\nrail travel (see Section 2.2), its environmental costs are \nabout\t9.4\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tcosts\tfor\tpassenger\trail\tin\ttotal.\tThis\t\nis because electric trains are more energy efficient than \ndiesel trains. Although high-speed trains have a higher \nelectricity consumption per train-km than conventional \nelectric trains they have a larger capacity and they can \ntransport more passengers per train.\n\nFor air transport, the main costs are related to the \nTTW GHG emissions, followed by the WTT emissions \n(in this case of both GHG and air pollutants). For air \npollution and climate change, the costs of air transport \n(Figure\u00a03.8)\tmakes\ta\tdistinction\tbetween\tshort-,\t\nmedium- and long-haul flights. For the noise costs of \nair transport, this distinction cannot be made and the \ncosts are reported for all flights. The direct air pollution \ncosts of aviation are relatively small compared with the \nother cost categories. According to the Commission \n(EC,\u00a02019d),\tthey\tconsist\tmainly\tof\tcosts\trelated\tto\tthe\t\nLTO of aircraft, as the cruising emissions lead to almost \nno air pollution damage.\n\nThe study also considers the climate effects of non-CO2 \nemissions by aviation.

Finally, the monetary value of the impacts \nmay also differ from the EU average, depending on the \ncountry where these sensitive areas are located.\n\n3.2.6 Environmental costs of train rides and flights\n\nThe previous sections have given an overview of the \nmain environmental impacts of train rides and flights. \nThis section evaluates the overall impacts of the WTT \nand TTW emissions of air pollutants and GHG, and the \nnoise costs, by expressing them in monetary terms. \nThis sheds light on the relative importance of the \nvarious impact categories as well as that of the costs of \nrail versus air travel.\n\nIt draws upon a recent study for the European \nCommission (EC, 2019d) that aims to provide \ninformation on how to generate state-of-the-art \nestimates for all main external costs of transport, \nincluding the environmental costs. The costs presented \nbelow are expressed in euros at average EU-28 prices \nin 2016. For the monetary evaluation of the GHG \nemissions the results reported here are based on a \nvalue\tof\tEUR\u00a0100\tper\ttonne\tof\tCO2e. For aviation the \ncosts relate to a selection of 33 airports in the EU, which \naccount\tfor\tslightly\tmore\tthan\t50\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\tpassengers\t\ncarried by the main airports in the EU.\n\nTotal costs of air pollution, climate change, noise and \nwell-to-tank emissions\n\nThe total costs of air pollution, climate change, noise \nand WTT emissions are higher for the selection of \nairports\t(EUR\u00a032.7\u00a0billion\teuro)\tthan\tfor\ttotal\tpassenger\t\nrail\tin\tthe\tEU-28\t(EUR\u00a07.8\tbillion)\t(Figure\t3.8).\tThese\t\nfigures for air and rail transport compare with a cost of \nEUR\u00a0161.2\tbillion\tfor\troad\tpassenger\ttransport.\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n30 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nAverage environmental costs of air pollution, climate \nchange, noise and well-to-tank emissions\n\nFigure 3.9 presents the average costs per passenger-km \nassociated with the direct (TTW and non-exhaust) and \nWTT emissions of air pollutants, GHG and noise.

The term 'marginal' \nmeans that these are the additional environmental \ncosts that occur as a result of an additional unit of \ntransport activity. The marginal costs are presented for \nspecific trains and aircraft, specific distances and load \nfactors, while the average costs that were presented \npreviously refer to average vehicles, distances and load \nfactors. Looking at the marginal costs sheds more light \non the variability of the environmental costs.\n\nFigure 3.10 \u2014 on rail transport \u2014 shows that the \nmarginal environmental costs related to air pollution, \nclimate change, WTT emissions and noise vary by \n\nFigure 3.9 Average costs of noise pollution, air pollution, climate change and well-to-tank emissions of \nrail\t(EU-28)\tand\taviation\t(selection\tof\tairports)\tand\tpassenger\tcars,\t2016\n\nNotes:\t The\taverage\tcosts\tfor\telectric\tpassenger\ttrains\talso\tinclude\tthose\tof\thigh-speed\ttrains.\tDirect\u00a0=\u00a0tank-to-wheel\tand\tnon-exhaust;\tfor\t\naviation including the non-CO2\tclimate\teffects.\n\nSource: EEA, based on EC (2019d).\n\ntypes of train and area, traffic conditions and time of \nday.

Some elements are highlighted below.\n\n3.3.1 Environmental impacts of travel to and from \nrailway stations and airports\n\nTaking a door-to-door perspective, the environmental \ncosts of rail and air travel should also consider \nthe environmental costs of travelling to and from \nthe railway station and airport. Depending on the \nlocation of the railway stations and airports and their \naccessibility via public transport, the environmental \ncosts of these trips may differ. The environmental \nimpacts of different modes for first and last mile \ntransport were discussed in last year's transport and \nenvironment report (EEA, 2019c).\n\nFigure 3.11 Marginal costs of air pollution, climate change and well-to-tank emissions of passenger air \ntransport for selected cases\n\nNotes: The\tstudy\tassumes\tthe\tfollowing\tnumber\tof\tpassengers\tper\taircraft:\tBombardier\tCRJ900\t\u2014\t67;\tEmbraer\t170\t(ERJ-170-100)\t\u2014\t57;\tAirbus\t\nA320-232\u2014\t139;\tBoeing\t737-700\t\u2014\t108;\tAirbus\tA340-300\u2014\t280;\tBoeing\t777-300ER\t\u2014\t373.\tDirect\u00a0=\u00a0tank-to-wheel\tand\tnon-exhaust;\tfor\t\naviation including the non-CO2\tclimate\teffects.\n\nSource: EEA, based on EC (2019d).\n\n3.3.2 Up- and downstream impacts of vehicles \nand\u00a0infrastructure\n\nTrains, aircraft and auxiliary vehicles\n\nThe life cycle of vehicles consists of production, \nmaintenance, repair and disposal. Throughout this \nlife cycle, negative environmental impacts arise, \nrelated to the emissions of air pollutants, GHGs and \nother pollutants. These impacts are related mainly to \naircraft and trains but also to auxiliary equipment. For \nexample, aviation requires ground support activities, \nfor which various types of equipment are used, such \nas auxiliary power units, fuel trucks, aircraft tugs and \nbelt loaders. Rail transport requires machines and \nvehicles for tasks such as shunting, track treatment and \ninfrastructure\u00a0monitoring.\n\nAs an example of the life cycle costs of vehicles, \nFigure\u00a03.12\tpresents\tresults\tfrom\ta\tstudy\tby\t\n(Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016),\twho\tuse\tan\tLCA\tto\testimate\tthe\t\nenergy and emissions from nearly 430 manufacturing \nactivities for the production of aircraft.

For rail, detailed \nstudies on the life cycle costs of train manufacturing \nare more difficult to find, and typically more attention is \npaid to the environmental impacts of the infrastructure, \nwhich is discussed below.\n\nDisposal and recycling decisions for disused rail \nvehicles and aircraft can also have significant \nconsequences for environmental impacts. Components \nand materials can be reused, remanufactured, recycled \nor disposed of. Zhao et al. (2020) explore the economic \nrationale behind different end-of-life strategies for \naircraft and aircraft engines.\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n35Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nInfrastructure\n\nSimilar to vehicles, the life cycle of rail and air \ninfrastructure (e.g. stations, airports, railway tracks, \nrail control centres) consists of the construction, \nmaintenance and disposal of infrastructures. Each of \nthese stages has environmental impacts.\n\nFor air transport, GHG emissions are embedded in the \nconstruction and expansion of airports. For example, \nin the comparison of three schemes for the expansion \nof UK airport capacity, the CO2e emissions related to \nthe construction of airport facilities and surface access \ninfrastructure\twere\tfound\tto\trange\tfrom\t3.9\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e \n(London\tGatwick\tsecond\trunway)\tto\t11.3\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e \n(London Heathrow north-west runway), depending \non the magnitude of the construction programme \n(UK\u00a0Department\tfor\tTransport,\t2018).\n\nFor rail, the literature has paid a lot of attention to \nthe emissions that are embedded in the construction \nand maintenance of rail (including HSR) lines and the \nextent to which these can be offset by lower emissions \nof rail transport compared with the modes it replaces. \nA review of four HSR lines for the International Union \n\nof Railways (UIC) by Baron et al. (2011) finds that the \ncarbon footprint of the construction of HSR lines \nranges\tfrom\t96\tto\t270\u00a0t\u00a0CO2 per km of track per year. \nFor the HSR project in the Basque Country in Spain, a \nrecent study by Bueno et al. (2017) found a footprint \nof\t251\u00a0t\u00a0CO2 per km of track per year, which is at the \nhigh end of this range. This is due to the high number \nof tunnels and viaducts that are needed for the line. \nIn an LCA for the Tours-Bordeaux high-speed line, de \nBortoli et al. (2020) presented various environmental \nindicators and the extent to which individual \nconstruction components and activities contribute to \nthem. Figure 3.13 shows that major contributions to \nthe GHG emissions for that project come from roadbed \n(22\u00a0%)\tand\trails\t(21\u00a0%),\tfollowed\tby\tthe\timpacts\trelated\t\nto\tviaducts\t(14\u00a0%),\tballast\t(11\u00a0%)\tand\tsleepers\t(10\u00a0%).\t\nSmaller contributors are construction stage transport, \nbuilding machines, the power supply system and \nchairs and fasteners. In general these impacts are \nvery project specific and depend on, for example, the \nterrain, which has implications for the civil engineering \nstructures that are required, the type of tracks (gravel \nbed tracks versus ballastless tracks \u2014 the latter having \nhigher embedded emissions in construction but \nless\u00a0maintenance),\tetc.\n\nFigure 3.13 Contribution of infrastructure components to the life cycle GHG emissions of single-track \nconstruction for the Tours-Bordeaux high-speed line\n\nSource: EEA, based on de Bortoli et al.

These are cases with low GHG emission \nintensity in the construction of the line, low WTW \nGHG emissions of rail, a high diversion of traffic from \nGHG-intensive modes and a high occupancy rate for rail. \nHowever, in cases with low potential, where the opposite \nof these conditions applies, it can take more than 50 years \nbefore a net reduction in GHG emissions is realised.\n\nThe construction and operation of airports, stations and \nrailway lines also has an impact on land use. Impacts are \nboth direct, through the uptake of land by the hubs and \ninfrastructure themselves, and indirect, through the land \ndevelopment projects that are induced by their presence. \nAdditional land take causes habitat damage and \nfragmentation, leading to adverse effects on ecosystems \nand biodiversity. In the case of railway lines, barrier \n\neffects arise in the form of physical and behavioural \nbarriers to wildlife movement, as well as disturbance to \npopulations living close to them, on account of noise, \nvibrations, chemical pollution and human presence. \nMortality among animals trying to cross the infrastructure \nis another \u2014 and most visible \u2014 manifestation of the \nbarrier effect. However, the magnitude of the effects \nis still not very well known (Barrientos and Borda de \nAgua, 2017). Other impacts of the infrastructures are \nvisual intrusion, soil sealing and soil and water pollution \nfrom the use of herbicides. The recently published EU \nTaxonomy report, in its list of assessment criteria for the \n'do no significant harm' assessment of the construction of \nland infrastructure (which includes railway infrastructure), \nalso identified the following other types of potential \nenvironmental\tharm\t(EU\u00a0Technical\tExpert\tGroup\ton\t\nSustainable Finance, 2020):\n\n\u2022 contamination of water during construction and \nunsustainable use of water during construction \nand\u00a0operations;\n\n\u2022 unsustainable use of resources during construction, \ne.g. generating large amounts of waste, no \nrecycling/reuse\tof\tconstruction\twaste;\n\n\u2022 noise pollution as a result of the poor condition of \nrail\ttracks;\n\n\u2022 change and degradation of hydromorphological \nconditions of water bodies as a result of railway \ninfrastructure (in particular tunnels), affecting \naquatic\tecosystems;\n\n\u2022 the\tspread\tof\tinvasive\tplants\t(such\tas\tJapanese\t\nknotweed) along transport infrastructure.\n\nA number of studies have tried to express the costs of \nhabitat damage and fragmentation in monetary terms. \nTable 3.3, adapted from EC (2019d), gives an example \nof such estimates at the EU-28 level for rail and aviation \ninfrastructure, on an annual basis. These are average \nfigures for the EU-28, and it should be kept in mind that \nlocal conditions are likely to have a large impact on the \ncosts and that research on this topic as well as on the \nmonetisation of the effects is still ongoing.\n\f\nThe environmental impacts of rail and air\u00a0transport\n\n37Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nTable 3.3  Cost contributing to the costs of habitat damage EU-28 (EUR2016)\n\nRail\t(EUR\tper\tkm\tand\tyear) Aviation  \n(EUR per km2\tand\tyear)HSR Other railways\n\nHabitat loss 57\u00a0500 8\u00a0200 437\u00a0500\n\nHabitat damage 27\u00a0000 5\u00a0900\n\nTotal habitat damage 84\u00a0500 14\u00a0100 437\u00a0500\n\nSource: Adapted from EC (2019d).\n\nFor rail, the same study calculates a total cost of \nhabitat\tdamage\tin\tthe\tEU-28\tof\tEUR\u00a02.7\tbillion\tper\t\nyear,\tor\tEUR\u00a00.006/passenger-km.\tFor\taviation,\tthe\t\ntotal costs per year for the 33 selected airports are \nestimated\tto\tbe\tEUR\u00a00.05\tbillion\tor\tEUR\u00a00.00007/\npassenger-km\tand\tEUR\u00a00.122/passenger.\n\nThe costs of habitat fragmentation are related \nto not only the presence of the transport \ninfrastructure but also the use of that \ninfrastructure.

Furthermore, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International \nAviation, or CORSIA, an initiative of the ICAO, targets the carbon emissions of international civil aviation. Its pilot phase \nstarts in 2021.\n\n\u2022 More general EU policy frameworks, transport policies, initiatives and funding instruments also influence the development \nof rail and air transport demand and supply and, therefore, the context in which environmental policies operate.\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nThe environmental impacts of medium- to long-distance \npassenger travel by rail and air are mitigated by various \npolicies at EU and international levels on the one \nhand and at the national level on the other.

The EU's \ncommitment to reaching its objectives finds expression \nin the EU 2030 energy and climate framework, the \nEnergy Union, the circular economy action plan and the \nEU implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable \ndevelopment. The European Green Deal also forms part \nof the European Commission's strategy to implement \nthe United Nation's 2030 agenda and the Sustainable \nDevelopment\tGoals\t(SDGs).\tIt\tseeks\ta\t90\u00a0%\treduction\t\nin transport emissions by 2050 compared with 1990 \n(EC,\u00a02019b).\n\nThe Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/CE) and its \nrevision in 2015 through Directive (EU) 2015/1513 set the \nregulatory framework for renewable energy in Europe \nup\tto\t2020.\tIt\tsets\ta\ttarget\tof\ta\t10\u00a0%\tshare\tof\trenewable\t\nenergy by 2020 in transport. For evaluating whether the \ntarget has been achieved, the target is computed as the \nratio of the amount of all types of renewable energy \nconsumed in all forms of transport and of the amount \nof petrol, diesel, biofuels and electricity used in road and \nrail transport. Renewable fuel in aviation can in principle \nalso contribute to the target share. The directive imposes \nadditional restrictions on the type of fuels that can be used.\n\nIn the EU transport sector, renewable energy made up \naround\t8.3\u00a0%\tof\tall\tenergy\tuse\tin\t2018.\tWith\trenewable\t\nelectricity playing only a small role in transport, the bulk of \nrenewable energy use in this sector comes from biofuels \n(Eurostat, 2020b). The use of sustainable aviation fuels \n(SAFs) in the EU is very small \u2014 for 2017 it was estimated \nto\tbe\tonly\tabout\t0.05\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\tjet\tfuel\tconsumption\t\n(EC, 2020c).\n\nThe\tRED\u00a0II,\tas\tthe\trecast\tof\tthe\tRenewable\tEnergy\t\nDirective (Directive (EU) 2018/2001) is known, applies to \nthe period 2021-2030 and confirms the increased use of \nrenewable energy as an instrumental part of the actions \nrequired to meet the EU climate change mitigation \nobjectives. For transport, which in 2018 still relied on \nfossil\tfuels\tfor\t94\u00a0%\tof\tits\tenergy\tsupply\t(Eurostat,\t2020c),\t\nthe share of renewable energy supplied for final energy \nconsumption\tshould\tbe\tat\tleast\t14\u00a0%\tby\t2030.\tThe\ttarget\t\nis set with respect to all types of fuels consumed in road \nand rail transport. Limits are imposed on biofuels made \nfrom crops with a high risk of causing high indirect land \nuse change (ILUC), i.e. food or feed crops or those crops \nfor which a significant expansion of the production area \nwould be into land with high carbon stocks. Such biofuels \nshould gradually be phased out by the end of 2030. \n\nCertain biofuels and types of biogas get an extra incentive, \nas their energy content is multiplied by two in calculating \nthe share of renewables. This applies to two groups of \nfuels: (1) fuels produced from used cooking oil and animal \nfats,\tfor\twhich\ta\tmaximum\tshare\tis\talso\timposed;\tand\t\n(2) the so-called advanced biofuels for which a gradually \nincreasing minimum share also applies. Extra incentives \nare given to the use of renewable electricity in rail \ntransport and to the use of renewable fuels (other than \nfood- and feed-based fuels) supplied to aviation.\n\nNo specific target is set for aviation. However, the European \nCommission is currently considering legislative options to \nboost the production and uptake of SAFs (EC, 2020c).\n\nThe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of rail and of \naviation within the European Economic Area are \naddressed directly or indirectly by the EU Emissions \nTrading System (ETS), which is discussed further in \nSection\u00a05.3.2.\tFor\trail,\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tis\trelevant\tfor\telectrified\t\nrail\ttransport.\tAbout\t72\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\trail\ttransport\t(in\tterms\t\nof train-km) takes place on electrified lines (Schroten \net al., 2019). By incentivising the electrification of rail \ninfrastructure for the Trans-European Transport Network \n(TEN-T) 'core network', the TEN-T policy leads to a shift \nin\tGHG\temissions\tfrom\trail\ttransport\tinto\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS.\t\nFor\taviation,\tthe\tcurrent\tscope\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tcovers\t\nonly flights within the European Economic Area, which \ncorresponds\tto\tabout\t36\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tCO2 emissions from \naviation (including international bunkers) of the countries \nin the European Economic Area in 2018. The rest of the \nemissions, from inbound or outbound flights to and from \nthe European Economic Area, are currently outside the \nscope of the system.\n\nFor air transport, the 1944 Chicago Convention on \nInternational Civil Aviation (Article 24) established the \nprinciple that fuel on board aircraft flying to, from or \nacross the territory of another contracting state should \nbe exempt from any national or local duties and charges. \nA series of bilateral agreements have subsequently \nextended this exemption to 'fuel supplied in the territory \nof one State party to an airline of the other party' (EEA, \n2016). Under the EU Directive on the common system of \nvalue added tax (VAT) (2006/112/EC), the supply of goods \nfor the fuelling and provisioning of aircraft for commercial \nair traffic on international routes should be exempt from \nVAT\t(Article\u00a0148).\tThe\tEnergy\tTaxation\tDirective\t(2003/96/\nEC) states that aircraft fuel, for commercial operations, is \nexempt from excise duty. Still, Member States may limit \nthe exemption to intra-community and international \nflights. Currently no aviation fuel taxes are levied in the \nEU (CE Delft and SEO Amsterdam Economics, 2019). The \nEuropean Green Deal states that '\u2026 in the context of the \nrevision of the Energy Taxation Directive, the Commission \nwill look closely at the current tax exemptions including \nfor aviation and maritime fuels \u2026' (EC, 2019b, p. 10).\n\f\nEuropean Union and national policy context and international agreements\n\n42 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n4.2.2 International\n\nAt the international level, the Carbon Offsetting and \nReduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) \n(ICAO, 2019a), an initiative of the International Civil \nAviation Organization (ICAO), targets the carbon \nemissions of international civil aviation (i.e. civil aviation \nflights that depart in one country and arrive in a \ndifferent country). Figure 4.1 gives an overview of the \nscheme. The ambition is to limit the carbon emissions \nfrom this sector to the level of emissions in 2020 \n(so-called carbon neutral growth from 2020).\n\nCORSIA is a world-wide scheme that enables the air \ntransport sector to offset its non-domestic emissions by \npurchasing and cancelling eligible carbon credits and/\nor deducting CO2 emissions corresponding to the use of \ncertain\tfuels.\tIt\twill\tbe\timplemented\tin\tthree\u00a0phases:\n\n\u2022 The pilot phase (2021-2023) and first phase \n(2024-2026) will apply to states that have volunteered \nto participate in the scheme.\n\n\u2022 The second phase (2027-2035) will apply to \nall states that have an individual share of \ninternational aviation activities, in revenue \ntonne-kilometres\u00a0(RTKs),\tin\t2018\tabove\t0.5\u00a0%\tof\t\ntotal\tRTKs\tor\tthat\tare\twithin\tthe\t90\u00a0%\tcumulative\t\nshare, from largest to smallest, of all international \naviation activity in the form of RTKs.

Two categories of fuel \ncan\u00a0be\tdistinguished:\n\n\u2022 CORSIA sustainable aviation fuel. This is a renewable \nor waste-derived aviation fuel that meets the \nCORSIA sustainability criteria.\n\n\u2022 CORSIA lower carbon aviation fuel. This is a \nfossil-based aviation fuel that meets the CORSIA \nsustainability criteria. These are traditional \nfossil fuels produced in a way that reduces their \nclimate\u00a0impact.\n\nTable 4.2 presents the current CORSIA sustainability \ncriteria for the CORSIA eligible fuels (additional criteria \nare undergoing adoption procedures). The baseline life \ncycle emissions value of jet fuel, to which the life cycle \nemissions of alternative fuels are compared, is set at \n89\u00a0g\u00a0CO2e/MJ.\n\nIt is expected that offsetting emissions will remain \nthe less expensive option in the short term and that \nCORSIA will not trigger the large-scale use of SAF. For \nexample, Mayeres et al. (2019) found that with offset \nprices\tof\tEUR\u00a010\tto\t50\tper\ttonne\tof\tCO2 there would \nbe no uptake of SAFs in 2030. However, the higher fuel \ncosts associated with the offset requirement lead to \nsome emission reduction in the aviation sector itself. \nThe bulk of the emission reduction would be realised \nvia\toffsetting\temissions\tin\tother\u00a0sectors.\n\nCORSIA complements international CO2 standards for \nnew aircraft that were adopted by ICAO in 2017. The \nstandards apply to type designs from 2020 and to \naircraft that are already in production as of 2023. Those \nin-production aircraft that do not meet the standard by \n2028 can no longer be produced unless their designs \nare\tsufficiently\tmodified\t(ICAO,\u00a02019a).\n\nTable 4.2  CORSIA sustainability criteria for CORSIA eligible fuels\n\nTheme Principle Criteria\n\nGHGs\nPrinciple: CORSIA eligible fuel should \ngenerate lower carbon emissions on \na life cycle basis.\n\nCriterion 1: CORSIA eligible fuel should achieve net GHG emissions \nreductions\tof\tat\tleast\t10\u00a0%\tcompared\twith\tthe\tbaseline\tlife\tcycle\temissions\t\nvalues for aviation fuel on a life cycle basis.\n\nCarbon stock\nPrinciple: CORSIA eligible fuel should \nnot be made from biomass obtained \nfrom land with high carbon stock.\n\nCriterion 1: CORSIA eligible fuel should not be made from biomass \nobtained\tfrom\tland\tconverted\tafter\t1\u00a0January\t2008\tthat\twas\tprimary\t\nforest, wetlands or peat lands and/or contributes to the degradation of the \ncarbon stock in primary forests, wetlands or peat lands, as these lands all \nhave high carbon stocks.\n\nCriterion\t2:\tIn\tthe\tevent\tof\tland\tuse\tconversion\tafter\t1\u00a0January\t2008,\tas\t\ndefined based on IPCC land categories, direct land use change (DLUC) \nemissions shall be calculated. If DLUC greenhouse gas emissions exceed the \ndefault induced land use change (ILUC) value, the DLUC value will replace the \ndefault ILUC value.\n\nNote: IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nSource: ICAO (2019b).\n\f\nEuropean Union and national policy context and international agreements\n\n44 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n4.2.3 National\n\nAt the national level, many countries levy fuel taxes on \ndiesel\tconsumption\tby\ttrains.\tAccording\tto\tSchroten\tet\u00a0al.\t\n(2019), Belgium, Hungary and Sweden do not charge \nfuel taxes on diesel for rail transport and in the other \nEU-27 countries there is significant variation in the rates. \nAccording to the same study only 16 of the EU-27 Member \nStates tax the electricity used in rail transport (and two \nhave no rail system). Two countries in Europe tax jet \nfuel for domestic flights, both of them non-EU countries \n(Norway and Switzerland). A number of countries in the \nEuropean Economic Area levy aviation ticket taxes.\n\nThere are initiatives in some European countries \nto support the uptake of SAF. For example, Norway \nintroduced the world's first national mandate for \njet\tbiofuel\tin\t2018,\tcalling\tfor\tat\tleast\t0.5\u00a0%\tSAF\t\nfrom sustainable non-food sources from 2020. The \nNorwegian government aims to increase this mandate \nto\t30\u00a0%\tby\t2030\t(Norwegian\tMinistry\tof\tClimate\tand\t\nEnvironment, 2019). The Netherlands is studying SAF \nsupply\tobligations\twith\ta\t14\u00a0%\ttarget\tin\t2030\t(Ministerie\t\nvan Infrastructuur en Waterstaat, 2020). Similar \nmandates have also been proposed in Finland, France, \nGermany, Spain and Sweden.\n\n4.2.4 Voluntary schemes and company initiatives\n\nExamples also exist of voluntary schemes organised \nat the level of an airline or another organisation, \nwhereby individual travellers compensate for their \nGHG emissions by making a financial contribution \nto a GHG-reduction project or pay for an uptake of \nSAFs. Examples of the latter are the corporate biofuel \nprogramme of Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM, 2020), \nLufthansa's Compensaid platform (Lufthansa, 2020) \nand the Swedish Fly Green Fund (Fly Green Fund, \nforthcoming). Several European airlines have recently \nimplemented airline-level voluntary offsetting schemes, \nsuch\tas\tEasyJet,\tAir\tFrance\tand\tBritish\tAirways\t(Air\t\nFrance,\t2020;\tBritish\tAirways,\t2020;\tEasyjet,\t2020).\t\nOther examples of such schemes are documented \nin Deane and Pye (2016) and Becken and Mackey \n(2017). Irwin (2009) describes theoretical and empirical \nevidence of cases in which people take voluntary \nactions to reduce their emissions.\n\nThe experience of most voluntary contribution schemes \nis that their uptake is relatively limited and that they \ntherefore make only a limited contribution to sustainable \nfuel uptake or GHG offsets. They can therefore be \nexpected to lead to emission reductions that are smaller \nthan socially optimal (Irwin, 2009). However, they help \nraise awareness and may signal customers' preference \nfor more sustainable air travel to airlines.\n\n4.3 Air pollution\n\nThe Air Quality Directive and the National Emission Ceilings \nDirective form the general framework for air quality \nin Europe. The former introduces ambient air quality \nstandards for the protection of human health, while the \nlatter sets national commitments to reduce emissions \nfor Member States and the EU for five air pollutants: (1) \nnitrogen oxides (NOx), (2) non-methane volatile organic \ncompounds (NMVOCs), (3) sulphur dioxide (SO2), (4) \nammonia (NH3) and (5) fine particulate matter (PM2.5).\n\nWithin Europe, railway engines' emissions are regulated \nby the non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) Regulation \n(EU) 2016/1628. At the national level, Schroten et al. \n(2019) found that in rail infrastructure access charges \nthere is only a small differentiation according to \nemission\u00a0characteristics.\n\nIn the case of aviation, the EU has set aircraft emission \nstandards in line with the engine certification standards set \nby the ICAO (ICAO, 2019a). The ICAO emissions certification \nstandards regulate smoke and various gaseous emissions \nfrom aircraft engines, including unburned hydrocarbons \n(HCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and \nnon-volatile particulate matter (nvPM). The smoke limit \naims to control visible emissions, whereas the limits for \ngaseous emissions and nvPM were set to address local \nair quality issues in the vicinity of airports. A reference \nlanding and take-off (LTO) cycle is used as the basis for \nthe calculation of the mass of gaseous emissions and the \nmass and number of particles. The standards apply to \nnew certified engine types and sometimes in-production \nengines (EASA et al., 2019). In March 2020, ICAO adopted \na new nvPM mass and number engine emission standard \nthat applies to both new and in-production engines from \n2023 onwards (ICAO, 2020b). Such harmonised standards \ngive a long-term incentive to invest in emission reductions. \nThey are complemented at some airports by charges that \nare differentiated according to the emission characteristics \nof the aircraft (Schroten et al., 2019). These charges vary \nbetween airports.\n\n4.4 Noise\n\nThe Environmental Noise Directive (Directive 2002/49/\nEC) sets the general framework for environmental \nnoise\u00a0management.\n\nNoise emission limits are applied in the EU for new \nrailway rolling stock. The obligation forms part of the \nRailway Interoperability Directive ((EU) 2016/797), \nthrough a technical specification for interoperability \non noise. Since its initial adoption in 2005, it has \nbeen amended several times. The latest version is \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 1304/2014 on the \n\f\nEuropean Union and national policy context and international agreements\n\n45Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\ntechnical specification for interoperability relating to \nthe subsystem 'rolling stock \u2014 noise', as amended by \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/774.\n\nFor aviation, the ICAO sets noise standards, which have \nbeen gradually tightened over time (ICAO, 2019a). These \nstandards have been implemented in EU legislation. In \naddition,\tRegulation\t(EU)\tNo\u00a0598/2014\tsets\ta\tcommon\t\napproach for procedures for the introduction of \nnoise-related operating restrictions at airports. This \napproach is set in line with the international principles \non noise management, agreed and recommended by \nthe ICAO \u2014 the so-called balanced approach. The aim \nof the regulation is to avoid inconsistencies in operating \nrestrictions across European airports. The regulation \nalso takes into account other environmental impacts and \ntherefore may lead to co-benefits for climate change and \nair\u00a0pollution.\n\nThe EU measures are complemented by national \npolicies. A small number of countries have rail access \ncharges that depend on the noise level of the trains. \nFor air transport, several airports apply noise charges. \nThe noise level can also determine the LTO charge. \nNoise charges are always differentiated by the noise \nclass or noise level of the aircraft, and they often also \ndepend on the time of the flight and the maximum \ntake-off weight of the aircraft. In addition, noise \n\nabatement measures are undertaken. Noise exposure \nfrom rail and air traffic is tackled by various measures. \nA classification by WHO and the EEA (2020b) makes a \ndistinction\tbetween\t(1)\u00a0noise\tcontrol\tmeasures\tat\tthe\t\nsource, (2) noise control measures in the propagation \npath, (3) urban planning and infrastructure change, \n(4) other physical measures and (5) education and \ncommunication. A review of the actions commonly \ntaken\tfound\tthat,\tfor\trail\ttraffic\tnoise,\t52\u00a0%\tof\tthe\t\nmeasures aim to control noise at the source via, for \nexample, changes to the rail tracks, trains or traffic \nmanagement.\tAnother\t27\u00a0%\taim\tto\tcontrol\tthe\tnoise\t\nin the propagation path, by installing noise barriers \nor\tinsulating\tdwellings\tand\tanother\t18\u00a0%\tby\tland\tuse\t\nplanning\tand\tinfrastructure\tchange\t(e.g.\u00a0construction\tof\t\nrail\ttunnels).\tFor\tair\ttraffic\tnoise,\t70\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tmeasures\t\ntaken try to control noise problems at the source, via \ntraffic management, incentives for quieter aircraft \nor\ttime\trestrictions\ton\tflights.\tOf\tthe\tmeasures,\t14\u00a0%\t\nconcern the propagation path, mainly focusing on the \ninsulation of houses. Education and communication \nmeasures also play a more important role in this case \n(8\u00a0%\tof\tmeasures),\tcompared\twith\trail\ttraffic\tnoise\twhere\t\nthey are almost not used.

The key \nitems are described here.\n\nIn December 2020, the European Commission published \nits Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy\t(EC,\u00a02020g).\t\nThe new strategy acknowledges that reducing emissions \nand becoming more sustainable is the most important \nchallenge for Europe's transport sector. It also states \nthat achieving the ambition of the European Green Deal \nrequires a 'fundamental transformation' of the mobility \nsystem towards sustainability and away from fossil fuels. \nThe strategy calls for a shift towards more sustainable \nmodes of transport and putting in place the right \nincentives to support the shift. \n\nRail plays an important role in this context. The strategy \nincludes the objective to increase the number of rail \npassengers and to create an 'affordable high-speed rail \nnetwork' across Europe. In concrete terms, the strategy \naims to double high-speed rail traffic by 2030 and triple \nit by 2050. Making high-speed rail services available \non short-haul distances and enabling carbon-neutral \ncollective\tpassenger\ttravel\tfor\tdistances\tbelow\t500\u00a0km\t\nby 2030 are also among its objectives. To improve \nlong-distance passenger rail services in Europe, a specific \naction plan proposal has been announced for 2021.\n\nThe strategy on low-emission mobility, published in \n2016 (EC, 2016), contains the following main elements: \n(1) increasing the efficiency of the transport system \nby\tmaking\tthe\tmost\tof\tdigital\ttechnologies;\t(2)\tsmart\t\npricing and further encouraging the shift to lower \nemission\ttransport\tmodes;\t(3)\tthe\tfaster\tdeployment\t\nof\tlow-emission\talternative\tenergy\tfor\ttransport;\tand\t\n(4)\u00a0the\tmove\ttowards\tzero-emission\tvehicles.\n\nThe 2011 Transport White Paper (EC, 2011b) set an \nambitious goal of reducing GHG emissions from \ntransport\tby\t60\u00a0%\tby\t2050\tcompared\twith\tthe\tlevel\t\nof these emissions in 1990. To achieve this, overall \nobjectives regarding modal shift were set, proposing \namong other things:\n\n\u2022 By 2030, the length of the existing high-speed rail \n(HSR) network should be tripled and a dense railway \nnetwork should be maintained in all Member \nStates. By 2050, the European HSR network should \nbe complete and the majority of medium-distance \npassengers should travel by rail.\n\n\u2022 By 2030, there should be a fully functional and \nEU-wide multimodal TEN-T 'core network', while \nby 2050 there should be a network of high \nquality and capacity, with a corresponding set of \ninformation\u00a0services.\n\n\u2022 By 2050, all core network airports should be \nconnected to the rail network, preferably the \nHSR\u00a0network.\n\n\u2022 By 2020, a framework for a European multimodal \ntransport information, management and payment \nsystem should be established.\n\nThe White Paper proposes a two-pronged strategy \nto promote a modal shift: first, to confront all modes \nwith their full costs (including the costs of negative \nexternalities) and, second, to directly improve the \nmarket conditions in non-road modes. The range \nof policy measures for improving the attractiveness \nof non-road modes is based on financial and \nregulatory mechanisms to increase their efficiency, \nwith the associated effect of reducing their prices \nfor users. A first subcategory is the financial support \nthrough dedicated programmes. At the European \nlevel, transport projects can benefit from numerous \nsources of financial assistance. Examples are the \nEuropean\tRegional\tDevelopment\tFund\t(ERDF);\tthe\t\nCohesion Fund/European Structural and Investment \nFund\t(ESIF);\tthe\tConnecting\tEurope\tFacility\t(CEF),\t\nin which multimodal integration is an overarching \npriority;\tand\tloans\tand\tguarantees\tfrom\tthe\t\nEuropean\u00a0Investment\tBank\t(EIB).\tMoreover,\tthe\t\nsuccessive European framework programmes for \nresearch and technological development, and their \nsuccessor, the Horizon 2020 framework programme \nfor research and innovation, also provide support \nfor transport projects. Promoting a modal shift away \nfrom road is a major criterion in the selection of \nthe\t\u00a0TEN-T\tprojects.\n\nA second subcategory consists in eliminating \nadministrative and technical barriers that diminish \nthe attractiveness of specific modes. In the railway \nsector, the railway packages and the recast of the \nDirective on the interoperability of the rail system \nwithin the Community (known as the Interoperability \nDirective) aim to create an internal market in  \nrail transport by opening up rail transport \nto regulated competition and removing \noperational\u00a0barriers.\n\nFor the aviation sector, the Air Service Regulation \n(Regulation\t(EC)\tNo\u00a0008/2008\ton\tcommon\trules\t\nfor the operation of air services in the Community) \nprovides the economic framework for air transport \nin the European Community.\n\f\nEuropean Union and national policy context and international agreements\n\n47Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nThe Shift2Rail joint undertaking (S2R\tJU)\tis\ta\tform\tof\t\npublic-private partnership in the rail sector. It supports \nresearch and innovation activities that can contribute \nto achieving the Single European Railway Area and to \nincreasing the attractiveness and competitiveness and \nimproving the safety of rail in Europe. Shift2Rail aims \nto introduce better trains to the market (quieter, more \ncomfortable, more dependable, etc.) that operate on \nan innovative rail network infrastructure, at a lower \nlife cycle cost and with the capacity to cope with rising \ndemand for rail transport for passengers and freight. \nBy improving the competitiveness and attractiveness \nof rail services, combined with increased capacity, the \nshare of travel by rail can increase, which contributes to \nreducing the CO2 emissions of the transport sector.\n\nThe Single European Sky (SES) initiative, adopted by \nthe European Commission in 2004 (and amended in \n2009),\tand\tthe\tSES\u00a0II\tlegislative\tpackage\tof\t2013\taim\t\nto modernise and harmonise air traffic management \n(ATM) systems by means of innovative technological \nand operational solutions. Its core idea is to shift the \ndesign of ATM from the national level to the EU level to \nrealise efficiencies of scale and to reduce administrative \nand technical barriers created by the legacy of national \napproaches. To this end, national air traffic control \norganisations are required to work together in regional \nairspace blocks. Binding key performance targets \nwere introduced for safety, capacity, cost efficiency \nand environmental performance. Eurocontrol, as \nthe network manager, performs certain tasks that \n\nare most efficiently carried out centrally (e.g. route \ndesign).\tThe\u00a0regulatory\tframework\tis\tcoupled\twith\ta\t\ntechnological modernisation programme, the 'SESAR \nproject' (Single European Sky ATM Research), with the \nprovision for financial incentives.\n\nOne of the four high-level goals of the SES initiative \nis to reduce the environmental impact per flight by \n10\u00a0%,\tcompared\twith\t2005.\tTwo\tenvironmental\tkey\t\nperformance indicators (KPIs) are defined, by which the \nlength of the trajectory flown can be assessed. In 2017, \nthe\tactual\ttrajectory\twas\ton\taverage\t2.81\u00a0%\tlonger\t\nthan the great-circle distance (PRB, 2018). Vertical flight \nefficiency, non-CO2 emissions, noise levels or air quality \nare not yet covered by the SES performance scheme \n(EASA et al., 2019).\n\nIn addition, the Clean Sky joint undertaking, funded \nby the Horizon 2020 programme, supports the \ndevelopment of innovative, cutting-edge aviation \ntechnology aimed at reducing emissions of CO2 and air \npollutants and noise levels produced by aircraft.\n\nThe European digital strategy formulates the EU's \napproach to digital technological development and \nto the ways in which technology will be used to meet \nclimate-neutrality objectives. One example is that \ntelecommunications, networks and connectivity make \nit possible to collaborate remotely instead of travelling, \nthe usefulness of which has become very prominent \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\f\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?48\n\nTrain or plane?\n\n5 Train or plane?\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nThis chapter further explores the environmental costs \nof travelling by train and air in mainland Europe, based \non an analysis for specific city pairs. Although the focus \nlies on these two modes, their environmental costs are \nalso compared with those of travelling by car, which is \nthe dominant mode of passenger transport in Europe.\n\nThe following environmental cost categories \nare\u00a0considered:\n\n\u2022 diesel train, aeroplane, car: the tank-to-wheel/-wake \n(TTW) emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and \nair\tpollutants;\n\n\u2022 car: emissions related to tyre and brake wear \ncombined\tand\tto\troad\tsurface\twear\u00a0(3);\n\n\u2022 electric train, aeroplane, car: the well-to-tank (WTT) \nemissions of GHGs related to fuel and electricity \nproduction,\ttransmission\tand\tdistribution;\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 An analysis of 20 city pairs shows that the environmental costs of rail travel are substantially lower than those of \nair\u00a0travel.\n\n\u2022 Because of the high environmental costs of landing and take-off, the environmental costs of air travel rise less than \nproportionally with distance.\n\n\u2022 The environmental costs of travelling to and from the railway station/airport account for only a small share of the total \nenvironmental costs if the city centre is the origin/destination. They are the largest when the main trip is done by air, \nas airports are most often located further away from the city centre than railway stations. The costs can become more \nimportant when the origins and destinations differ from the city centres of the city pairs considered.\n\n\u2022 In all cases, electric rail transport between the city pairs and air travel between the airport pairs is covered by the \nEU Emissions Trading System, which has implications for the ultimate impact of a modal shift in greenhouse gas \nemissions,\u00a0as\tdiscussed\tin\tSection\t5.3.3.\n\n(3) Non-exhaust emissions are also relevant for rail and aviation, but no emission factors are available.\n\n\u2022 train,\taeroplane,\tcar:\tnoise\tpollution;\n\n\u2022 the non-CO2 climate costs of aviation.\n\nThe environmental costs related to the manufacturing \nof the vehicles (and batteries for electric cars), their \nmaintenance and the construction and maintenance \nof the transport infrastructure are not covered in this \nanalysis. Hence, the scope is a well-to-wheel/-wake \n(WTW) analysis, rather than a life cycle analysis (see the \nillustration of these concepts in Figure 3.1. \n\nIn addition to this environmental cost analysis, this \nchapter further investigates the implications for \nthe environment of a shift from rail to air transport, \nincluding the mechanisms at work in the EU Emissions \nTrading System (ETS).\n\f\nTrain or plane?\n\n49Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n5.2 Environmental costs of travelling by \nrail and air \u2014 an analysis for specific \ncity pairs\n\n5.2.1 Selection of the city pairs\n\nThis chapter assesses the environmental impacts of \ntravel for 20 main city pairs. For the selection of the city \npairs the following steps were followed:\n\n\u2022 First, Eurostat data were gathered on the annual \nnumber of passengers on direct flights between \nairports in the EU-27 (Eurostat, 2020a). The top \n70 airport pairs were identified, and connections \nto the EU's outermost regions (e.g. the Azores or \nthe Canary Islands) (EC, 2020f) and connections to \nislands in Europe were excluded. The main city in \nthe vicinity of each airport was identified.\n\n\u2022 In order to get a geographically balanced set of \ncity pairs across mainland EU countries, several \nconnections were added.\n\n\u2022 Only city pairs with a rail connection \nwere\u00a0considered.\n\nOut of this longlist of city pairs, 20 city pairs were \nselected. In this selection, the following additional \ncriteria were used:\n\n\u2022 There should be a balanced coverage of three \ndistance bands, where distance is measured by the \ndistance by car between the city pairs by the fastest \nroute on a popular web mapping service.\n\n \u2013 Of the 20 city pairs, six pairs cover a car distance \nbelow\t500\u00a0km,\teight\tpairs\tcover\ta\tdistance\tof\t\nbetween\t500\tand\t750\u00a0km,\tand\tsix\tpairs\tcover\t\na\tdistance\tof\tbetween\t750\tand\t1\u00a0100\u00a0km.\tThe\t\nthree distance bands are relevant for the choice \nbetween rail and air transport and cover both \ndistances for which rail is competitive with air \nand distances for which that is less the case.\n\n\u2022 The selection covers both city pairs with a good railway \nconnection and pairs with a railway connection of \nmedium to lower quality. For the quality assessment \nof the rail connection, account was taken of the travel \ntime by rail, the rail travel time per kilometre and the \nnumber of transfers per hour, using data collected via \nthe web mapping service and Trainline (forthcoming). \nThis information was collected before the COVID-19 \noutbreak\tin\tthe\u00a0EU:\n\n \u2013 The rail connection is taken to be of high \nquality if the travel time is below 4 hours and \nthe number of transfers per hour and the \ntravel\ttime\tper\tkilometre\tare\tbelow\tthe\t80\u00a0%\t\npercentile value for the longlist of city pairs. \nIf one of the last conditions is not met, the \nconnection is taken to be of medium quality.\n\n \u2013 The rail connection is also taken to be of \nmedium quality if the travel time is between \n4\u00a0and\t8\thours\tand\tthe\tnumber\tof\ttransfers\tper\t\nhour and the travel time per hour are below \nthe\t80\u00a0%\tpercentile\tvalue\tfor\tthe\tlonglist\tof\tcity\t\npairs. If one of the last conditions is not met, \nthe connection is taken to be of lower quality.\n\n \u2013 The rail connection is also taken to be of lower \nquality\tif\tthe\ttravel\ttime\tis\tlonger\tthan\t8\u00a0hours.\n\n \u2013 Five city pairs have a high-quality rail \nconnection according to the criteria defined \nabove. Another six pairs have a medium \nquality, while the others have a lower quality \nconnection, usually because the maximum \ntravel time of 8 hours is exceeded.\n\nFor each city pair, an alternative origin/destination \npair was selected, consisting of two other cities in \nthe vicinity that are potentially served by the railway \nstation or airport of the main cities. This takes into \naccount the fact that the travel distance to/from the \nrailway station/airport is not necessarily the travel \ndistance from the centres of the main cities.\n\nTable 5.1 presents the selection of city pairs, the \nassociated additional city pairs, the distance by car \nand the distance by air as well as an assessment \nof the quality of the rail connection based on the \ncriteria presented above. In addition, the table \ngives the number of air travellers in 2018, based \non Eurostat data. For some city pairs, numbers are \ngiven for the rail travellers based on various sources. \nHowever, as no European data set is available for \nrail passengers for the respective city pairs, the \ninformation in this column is less complete. The \nlack of statistics for rail travel between European \ncities comparable to those for aviation makes \nassessing the current situation and the policy options \nmore\u00a0difficult.\n\f\nTrain or plane?\n\n50\n\nTable 5.1  Overview of city pairs\n\nN\no\n\nO\nri\n\ngi\nn\n\n(m\nai\nn\t\nci\nty\n)\n\nD\nes\nti\nna\n\nti\non\n\n\t(m\nai\nn\t\nci\nty\n)\n\nO\nri\n\ngi\nn\n\n(a\nlt\ner\nna\n\nti\nve\n\n\tc\nit\ny)\n\nD\nes\n\nti\nna\n\nti\non\n\n \n(a\nlt\ner\nna\n\nti\nve\n\n\tc\nit\ny)\n\nD\nis\n\nta\nnc\n\ne \nby\n\n c\nar\n\n \nbe\n\ntw\nee\n\nn \nm\n\nai\nn \n\nci\nti\nes\n\u00a0(k\n\nm\n)\n\nD\nis\n\nta\nnc\n\ne \nby\n\n a\nir\n\n \nbe\n\ntw\nee\n\nn \nai\n\nrp\nor\n\nts\n o\n\nf \nm\nai\nn\t\nci\nti\nes\n\t(k\n\nm\n)\n\nRa\nil \n\nqu\nal\n\nit\ny\n\nAi\nr p\n\nas\nse\n\nng\ner\n\ns \nca\n\nrr\nie\n\nd \nbe\n\ntw\nee\n\nn \nai\n\nrp\nor\n\nts\n o\n\nf \nm\nai\nn\t\nci\nti\nes\n\t(2\n01\n8)\n\t\n\n(m\nill\nio\nn)\n\nRa\nil \n\npa\nss\n\nen\nge\n\nrs\n \n\nca\nrr\n\nie\nd \n\nbe\ntw\n\nee\nn \n\nm\nai\n\nn \nci\nti\nes\n\t(m\n\nill\nio\nn)\n\nCar\tdistance\tof\tup\tto\t500\u00a0km\n\n1\nKrakow, Poland\n\nWarsaw, \nPoland\n\nWieliczka, \nPoland\n\nPiaseczno, \nPoland\n\n293 284 High 0.398\n\n2\nBrussels, \nBelgium\n\nFrankfurt am \nMain, Germany\n\nLeuven, \nBelgium\n\nWiesbaden, \nGermany \n\n398 366\nMedium \n\n(transfers/\nhour)\n\n0.882\n0.09-0.115 \n\n(CER)\n\n3\nSofia, Bulgaria Varna, Bulgaria\n\nPernik, \nBulgaria\n\nNovi Pazar, \nBulgaria\n\n441 387 Low 0.288\n\n4 Bucharest, \nRomania\n\nCluj-Napoca, \nRomania\n\nPloie\u0219ti,\t\nRomania\n\nTurda, Romania 453 346 Low 0.490\n\n5\nLyon, France Paris, France\n\nSaint-\u00c9tienne, \nFrance\n\nVersailles, \nFrance\n\n468 463 High 0.641 3.4 (T&E)\n\n6 Frankfurt am \nMain, Germany \n\nHamburg, \nGermany \n\nWiesbaden, \nGermany\n\nL\u00fcneburg, \nGermany \n\n492 488 High 1.439 1.2 (CER)\n\n7\nAthens, Greece\n\nThessaloniki, \nGreece\n\nThebes, \nGreece\n\nEdessa, Greece 500 368 Medium 1.512\n\nCar\tdistance\tof\tbetween\t500\tand\t750\u00a0km\n\n8 Amsterdam, \nNetherlands\n\nParis, France\nUtrecht, \n\nNetherlands\nVersailles, \n\nFrance\n516 467 High 1.403 2 (KiM)\n\n9\nOslo, Norway \n\nStockholm, \nSweden \n\nDrammen, \nNorway\n\n\u00d6smo, Sweden 522 426 Medium 1.449\n\n10\nMadrid, Spain \n\nBarcelona, \nSpain \n\nGuadalajara, \nSpain\n\nSabadell, Spain 625 545 High 2.468 3.9 (T&E)\n\n11\nMadrid, Spain \n\nLisbon, \nPortugal \n\nGuadalajara, \nSpain\n\nSet\u00fabal, \nPortugal \n\n629 583 Low 1.518\n\n12\nCopenhagen, \n\nDenmark\nStockholm, \n\nSweden \nRoskilde, \nDenmark\n\n\u00d6smo, Sweden 657 550\nLow \n\n(transfers/\nhour)\n\n1.511\n\n13\nBerlin, Germany Vienna, Austria \n\nPotsdam, \nGermany\n\nSankt P\u00f6lten, \nAustria \n\n685 603 Low 1.051\n0.02-0.05 \n\n(CER)\n\n14\nVienna, Austria\n\nZurich, \nSwitzerland\n\nSankt P\u00f6lten, \nAustria\n\nZug, \nSwitzerland\n\n722 655 Medium 0.982\n0.161 (2019)\n\n(CER)\n\nCar\tdistance\tof\tmore\tthan\t750\u00a0km\n\n15 Amsterdam, \nNetherlands\n\nCopenhagen, \nDenmark \n\nUtrecht, \nNetherlands\n\nRoskilde, \nDenmark\n\n800 676 Low 1.092\n\n16 Frankfurt am \nMain, Germany \n\nLjubljana, \nSlovenia\n\nWiesbaden, \nGermany\n\nKamnik, \nSlovenia\n\n804 683 Low 0.145 0.001 (CER)\n\n17\nMilan, Italy Paris, France\n\nMonza e \nBrianza, Italy \n\nVersailles, \nFrance\n\n851 722 Medium 1.922\n\n18\nMilan, Italy Vienna, Austria \n\nMonza e \nBrianza, Italy \n\nSankt P\u00f6lten, \nAustria\n\n867 732 Low 0.369\n\n19 Budapest, \nHungary\n\nFrankfurt am \nMain, Germany\n\nV\u00e1c, Hungary \nWiesbaden, \n\nGermany \n964 917 Low 0.660\n\n0.001-0.005 \n(CER)\n\n20 Barcelona, \nSpain\n\nParis, France\nSabadell, \n\nSpain\nVersailles, \n\nFrance\n1038 945 Medium 2.478 0.02 (T&E)\n\nNotes:  Distance by car: distance between city centres of main cities of origin and destination, fastest route according to web mapping service.\n\nDistance by air: average distance based on Eurocontrol data for 2017 to 2019 (except for Copenhagen-Stockholm, the data for which \ncame from Flight Plan Database).\n\nAir passengers carried: passengers arriving and departing in main city of origin, based on Eurostat data for 2018.\n\n Rail passengers: CER communication (data for one operator for each connection), Savelberg et al.

Account \nis taken of the environmental costs of transport to \nand from the railway station or airport (referred to \nbelow\tas\u00a0pre-\tand\tpost\ttransport).\tThe\tcosts\tcan\tbe\t\nconsidered to be the marginal environmental costs: \nthe\u00a0costs\tof\tan\tadditional\tpassenger-km\tfor\teach\t\ncity pair, using a specific train/aircraft type, with a \nspecific load factor, covering a specific distance, just \nto name a few of the characteristics of the transport \noptions between the city pair. Figure 5.1 illustrates \nthe\u00a0approach\tfor\tone\tcity\tpair.\n\nFor the main trip, the environmental impacts are \ncalculated for three modes: car, rail and air transport. \nAlthough the focus of the report and of the discussion \nin this section lies on rail and air transport, the \nenvironmental costs are also calculated for car \ntransport, as an additional point of comparison. \nFor\u00a0transport\tto\tand\tfrom\tthe\tmain\trailway\tstation\tor\t\nairport, the distance by car from the city centre to the \nmain railway station or airport is taken. Three modes \nare considered: car, bus and (heavy) rail.\n\nTable 5.2 shows the car, bus and train types  \nconsidered for the city pairs as well as a selection of \naircraft\ttypes\u00a0(4). It also presents the capacity of the  \n\nvehicles/aircraft as well as the assumption that is \nmade for the occupancy rates. The occupancy rate of \nthe aeroplanes is based on data from Eurostat for the \nrespective city pairs (see Table A1.2 in Annex 1).\n\nTwo types of car with an internal combustion engine \nare included as is an electric car, while recognising that \nfor longer distance trips, the range of the electric car \nstill entails higher time costs of travel on account of \nadditional and longer charging stops.\n\nFor rail transport, five different trains are included \nin the analysis. The high-speed train is the only train \nthat cannot be used for transport to/from the railway \nstation/airport. For the city pairs that do not have \na high-speed rail (HSR) connection (see Table A1.2 \nin Annex 1), intercity trains are used for the main \ntrip. The city pairs that do have an HSR connection \nobviously use it as a main transport mode. The \noccupancy rate given is taken to be the same as that \nin\u00a0Schroten\tet\tal.\t(2019).\n\nFor car travel, two different average occupancy rates \nare used: one and four. The first reflects the conditions \nfor business travel or recreational travel by one person, \nand the second reflects the conditions for recreational \ntravel with a larger group. The environmental costs of \ntravelling with two or three people will logically lie in \nbetween the two values reported here.\n\nFigure 5.1  Illustration of the approach for a trip between Brussels/Leuven and Frankfurt/Wiesbaden\n\n(4) See Annex 1 for the full list of aircraft types.\n\nBrussels\n\nLeuven\n\nFrankfurt\n\nWiesbaden\n\nCAR\n\nAIR\n\nBrussels\n\nLeuven\n\nBrussels \nairport\n(EBBR)\n\nFrankfurt\n\nWiesbaden\n\nBUS\n\nFrankfurt \nam Main\nairport\n(EDDF)\n\nCar or \npublic transport\n\nCar or \npublic transport\n\nBUS\n\nRAIL\n\nBrussels\n\nLeuven\n\nBruxelles \nMidi\n\nFrankfurt\n\nWiesbaden\n\nBUS\n\nFrankfurt \n(Main)\n\nHbf\n\nCar or \npublic transport\n\nCar or \npublic transport\n\nBUS\n\f\nTrain or plane?\n\n52 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nIn the graphs shown below, not all transport types are \nshown for the sake of clarity. Of course, which transport \nmode\tand\tvehicle\ttype\tis\tused\tis\tindicated\tfor\u00a0each\tgraph.\n\nThe environmental cost categories considered are \ndescribed in Section 5.1. For bus transport, the same \ncost categories are considered as for car transport. The \ninputs for the calculation of the emissions are presented \nin Annex 1.\n\nAs indicated in Section 3.2.1, aviation also emits short-lived \nclimate forcers, including SO2, NOx and black carbon. This \nleads to changes in the radiative forcing in the climate \nsystem, including the forming of contrails and cirrus \nclouds, which both warm the atmosphere. In the report \nby the European Commission (EC, 2019d) the total climate \nchange costs of aviation are taken to be twice the costs \nof the CO2 emissions alone. To compare, a recent report \nfor the German Environmental Agency indicated that the \ntotal impact (for the global fleet) is about five times the \nimpact of CO2 emissions alone for constant emissions, and \nthe total impact for pulse emissions (e.g. for emissions \nof an individual flight) is about three times the impact of \nCO2 emissions. That report points out that, rather than \nusing a constant factor, the underlying processes can also \nbe accounted for in a better way. However, this requires \nmore data than are available here (Nikla\u00df et al., 2020). \nTo reflect the uncertainty over the non-CO2 climate costs \nof aviation, the approach of Cox and Althaus (2019) is \nfollowed. They take the total climate impact during the \nflight\tphase\tat\tan\taltitude\tabove\t9\u00a0km\tto\tbe\ta\tfactor\tof\t\n1.3-3.6 of the combustion-related CO2 emissions. Based \non this information three different options were taken \ninto account for the non-CO2 climate costs: base, medium \nor central, and high values, in which the non-CO2 climate \ncosts amount to 0.3, 1 and 2.6 times, respectively, the \nimpact of the CO2 emissions during the climb, cruise, \ndescent\t(CCD\u00a0phase).\tThe\tmedium\tvalue\tcorresponds\tto\t\nthe approach taken in EC (2019d). It should be noted that \nthe non-CO2 climate effect could be slightly overstated \n\nhere,\tbecause\tthe\tCCD\tphase\tstarts\tat\tan\taltitude\tof\t10\u00a0m\t\nand ends when the aeroplane descends below an altitude \nof\t300\u00a0m\t(Goblet\tet\tal.,\t2015).\tThis\talso\tjustifies\tthe\trange\t\nof aviation-related non-CO2 emissions that was adopted \nhere. Most recently, the European Aviation Safety Agency \nprepared an updated analysis of the non-CO2 effects \nof aviation at the request of the European Commission \n(EASA, 2020c). The new report confirms the significance of \nthese effects and, by and large, also confirms the range of \nnon-CO2 climate costs used here. However, as the analysis \nwas published in late 2020, it was not possible to fully align \nthe calculations with the findings of the report. \n\nIn order to calculate the costs related to the emissions of \nair pollutants and GHGs, we use the cost per kilogram or \ntonne of emissions put forward in EC (2019d). For all city \npairs, we use the average EU value. The costs for the air \npollutants include the costs related to the health effects, \ncrop loss, biodiversity loss and material damage and are \ndetermined using the impact pathway method. In this \napproach, the environmental costs are estimated by \nfollowing the pathway from source emissions via changes \nin the quality of air, soil and water to physical impacts, \nwhich are then expressed in monetary costs. For the \nGHG emissions, EC (2019d) considers so-called avoidance \ncosts, i.e. the costs that are implied by achieving the \ntarget set by the Paris Agreement. The central value \nfor the short- and medium-term costs (up to 2030) is \nEUR\u00a0100/t\u00a0CO2e,\twhile\tthe\tlow\tand\thigh\tvalues\tare\tEUR\u00a060\t\nand\tEUR\u00a0189/t\u00a0CO2e, respectively. In this report the central \nvalue is used. All values used are summarised in Annex 1.\n\nFor noise pollution, the evidence from EC (2019d) \non the average external noise costs per vehicle-km, \ntrain-km and landing and take-off (LTO) is taken as an \napproximation to calculate the external noise costs (see \nalso Annex 1). Behind this average value are costs that \nare highly dependent on the time of day, population \ndensity and vehicle type/aircraft, as discussed \nin\u00a0Section\t3.2.6.\n\nTable 5.2 Overview of vehicle/train/aeroplane types, capacity and assumptions about occupancy rate\n\nMode Vehicle/aeroplane type Capacity Occupancy Occupancy\trate\t(%)\n\nTrain\n\nHigh-speed train 500 330 66\n\nIntercity electric train 500 180 36\n\nIntercity diesel train 500 180 36\n\nRegional electric train 350 105 21\n\nRegional diesel train 350 105 21\n\nBus Bus,\tEuro\u00a0VI,\tdiesel 30 20 66\n\nCar\n\nMedium\tpetrol\tEuro\u00a06\t(up\tto\t2016)\n\n5 1 and 4 20-80Medium\tdiesel\tEuro\u00a06\t(up\tto\t2016)\n\nMedium electric car\n\nSource: Rail\tand\tbus:\tSchroten\tet\tal.\t(2019).\tOccupancy\trate\tfor\taircraft\tand\tcars\tbased\ton\tauthors'\tassumptions;\tfor\taircraft\tcapacity,\t\nsee\u00a0Table\u00a0A1.1in\tAnnex\t1.\n\f\nTrain or plane?\n\n53Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n5.2.3 Comparing the environmental performance\n\nComparison of different transport modes\n\nThe different transport modes are compared in two \ngraphs: Figure 5.2 displays the environmental costs for \nall of the different transport modes travelling the same \ndistance\tof\t500\u00a0km\ton\tthe\tmain\ttrajectory.\tOnly\tthe\t\nfive most frequently used aircraft types are displayed. \nFigure\u00a05.3\tpresents\tthe\tsame\tinformation\tfor\ta\tdistance\t\nof\t1\u00a0000\u00a0km.\tIn\tboth\tfigures,\tan\taircraft\toccupancy\trate\tof\t\n80\u00a0%\tis\tassumed.\tThese\ttwo\tfigures\tmake\tit\tpossible\tto\t\nspot the differences between the transport modes when \ntheir main trajectories are the same. A discussion of the \ndifferent city pairs will follow later in which the distances for \nthe different transport modes will differ from each other.\n\nConsidering\tthe\tdistance\tclass\tof\t500\u00a0km\tfirst\t\n(Figure\u00a05.2),\tit\tcan\tbe\tseen\tthat\tfor\tthe\tcentral\tvalue\t\nof the non-CO2 climate costs, travelling by air causes \nmore than six times higher environmental costs than \ntravelling by HSR. Travelling in a fully occupied car, with \nfour people, also has significantly lower environmental \ncosts per passenger than travelling by air. The costs of \nonly one person travelling in a diesel or petrol car is the \nhighest of all travel alternatives considered here.\n\nComparing Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3, it can be seen \nthat the ranking between the different transport \n\nmodes does not change significantly for the two \ndistances. It is clear that the train is the transport \nmode with the lowest cost, except for electric cars \nwith four occupants. These electric cars seem to have \na comparable environmental cost to that of trains. \nFor electric cars with one passenger, the noise costs \naccount for about half of the environmental costs. The \noccupancy rate and the noise cost make electric cars \nwith one passenger the third most environmentally \nfriendly option. Second after rail come diesel and \npetrol cars with four occupants. Apart from electric \ncars with one passenger, it is unclear which transport \nmode will have the third lowest cost, either cars \nwith one passenger or air travel. This will depend \non the non-CO2 climate costs of aviation and will be \ndiscussed in more detail. The figures show the central \nvalue for the non-CO2 climate costs, which equals \nthe costs of the CO2 emissions during CCD. The low \nand high values that were indicated earlier, 0.3 and \n1.6 times the costs of the CO2 emissions, are shown \nas error bars, to indicate the uncertainty around \nthis\u00a0component.\n\nAlthough the environmental cost per passenger of rail \nis lower than that of air, the noise costs are comparable \nor, in the case of HSR for longer distances, higher than \nfor air travel. For rail, the noise costs depend on the \ndistance, while for air travel they do not, as they are \ngenerated during LTO.\n\nFigure\t5.2\t\t \tEmission\tcosts\tof\tdifferent\ttransport\tmodes\t(500\u00a0km)\n\nNote:\t\t The\terror\tbars\treflect\tthe\tuncertainty\tfor\tthe\tnon-CO2 climate costs of aviation based on Cox and Althaus (2019).

Note that the total cost \nfor intercity trains is higher than that for HSR. This is \nthe result of two aspects. Firstly, while the electricity \nconsumption per train-km is higher for HSR than for \nthe electric intercity train, the assumed occupancy rate \nis substantially higher for HSR (see Table 5.2), leading \nto a lower electricity consumption per passenger-km. \n\nFigure\t5.3\t\t \tEmission\tcosts\tof\tdifferent\ttransport\tmodes\t(1\u00a0000\u00a0km)\n\nNote:\t\t The\terror\tbars\treflect\tthe\tuncertainty\tfor\tthe\tnon-CO2 climate costs of aviation based on Cox and Althaus (2019).

When four seats in a \nfive seater car are occupied, the cost per passengerkm comes close to that of rail. However, when the \naverage number of passengers per car drops to \none, the environmental costs per passenger-km fall \nwithin the range of the costs related to aeroplanes. \nThis,\u00a0however,\tdepends\ton\tthe\tnon-CO2 climate costs \nof flying.

There still is, as already said, \nuncertainty about the magnitude of this component. \nThe figures therefore consider a wide range for this \ncost, from 0.3 times to 2.6 times the costs of the CO2 \nemissions while at cruising altitude.

For example, not all city pairs \nare connected by HSR and large aircraft with a large \nnumber of passengers on board are not used for all city \npairs. Therefore, Figure 5.6 indicates the environmental \ncosts of travelling between the different city pairs, with \ntheir available transport modes.\n\nThe environmental costs displayed for each city pair \nand transport mode and their interrelationship are \nlargely in line with the story in the previous section. \nHowever, some elements have an impact on the \nrelative magnitude of the costs of the different \ntransport modes.\n\nThe first element is the difference in trajectory length \nfor the different transport modes. This is most evident \nfor the Milan-Paris case. The distance travelled from the \norigin\tto\tthe\tdestination\tis\t914\u00a0km\tand\t722\u00a0km\tfor\tthe\t\ncar and aeroplane, respectively. This makes an aeroplane \nmore attractive when looking at the environmental \ncost, despite the \u2014 in most cases \u2014 higher costs for \naeroplanes per kilometre travelled. A second influence \nis the aeroplane used on the trajectory. When an \naeroplane with a lower number of seats is used, the \ncost per passenger increases and therefore this type of \ntransport will be less attractive from an environmental \nperspective. Furthermore, the emission characteristics \nof the different aeroplanes can differ significantly. For \nsome city pairs, relatively old aeroplanes are used, with \na less efficient propulsion system than that of newer \naeroplanes on other trajectories. A third parameter, which \nhas only a small influence on the relative magnitudes, \nis the availability of an HSR connection between the \ntwo cities. If there is only an intercity train for the whole \ntrajectory, the environmental costs for an electric car \nwith four occupants will become comparable with trains. \nThis, however, is not the case for electric cars with only \none occupant, as these have a higher environmental cost \nthan\u00a0rail\ttravel.\n\nIn addition to these elements, the transport to and \nfrom the railway station/airport could also have an \nimpact on the relative performance of the transport \nmodes. Details about how these costs were computed \ncan be found in Annex 1. Figure 5.7 displays the \nenvironmental costs per main city pair. It can be seen \nthat the impact of the environmental costs of pre- and \npost-transport phases is limited. In fact, these costs \nare even negligible for all transport modes except for \nair transport. This is because airports are most often \nlocated further away from the city centre than railway \nstations. Naturally there is no pre- and post-transport \ncost for trajectories with a passenger car as the main \ntransport mode, as the whole trip is assumed to be \ndone by car.\n\nIt must be noted here that the pre- and post-transport \ncosts for trains in Figure 5.7 are shown only for intercity \nelectric\ttrains;\tfor\tcars,\tcosts\tfor\tonly\ta\tdiesel\tcar\twith\t\none occupant are shown. However, even with this last \nrelatively environmentally unfriendly transport mode \nthe environmental costs of pre- and post-transport are \nnegligible, except for cases where an aeroplane is the \ntransport mode on the main trajectory.\n\nThe magnitude and share of the environmental costs \nof the pre- and post-transport phases increases, \nhowever, when these are calculated for the alternative \ncity pairs. This is shown in Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9. \nThese figures present the environmental costs for \nthe main and alternative city pair, respectively, in \nthe Barcelona-Paris case. When the train is the main \ntransport mode, Figure 5.9 shows a non-negligible, \nand\tactually\tlarge,\tenvironmental\tcost\tfor\tthe\tpre-\u00a0and\t\npost-transport phases in contrast to Figure 5.8. \nFor air transport as the main transport mode, the \ndifference is rather limited. In both cases, the cost \nis non-negligible, depending on the mode that is \nchosen. It should be noted here that the chosen main \ntrajectory is rather long, so that the environmental \ncost of pre- and post-transport phases are, of course, \nof lesser importance in this case. The environmental \ncosts for the other city pairs can be found in Annex 2 \nand show comparable results.\n\f\nTrain or plane?\n\n60 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or

report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\n5.3 The environmental impacts of the \nmodal shift from air to rail\n\n5.3.1 Going beyond the relative environmental cost \ncomparison for rail and air\n\nThe analysis in Section 5.2 sheds light on the relative \nenvironmental performance of the two modes. To \nunderstand the environmental impact of a modal shift \nfrom air to rail passenger transport, it is, however, not \nenough to compare their current environmental costs.\n\nFirstly, one needs to consider potential rebound effects \nlinked to induced demand and the uptake of freed \nslots at airports. As mentioned in Section 2.4, more \nattractive rail options may lead to induced demand \n(people travelling more by rail or over longer distances). \nThe\tcoverage\tof\taviation\temissions\tby\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tmight\t\nalso result in effects on emissions from other sectors (or \nflights\tnot\tcovered\tby\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS),\talthough\tsuch\teffects\t\nare relatively complex to determine (see Section 5.3.2).\n\nSecondly, if the accommodation of additional rail travellers \nrequires infrastructure investments and additional trains, \nthe environmental costs of building, operating and \nmaintaining the infrastructure and manufacturing the \ntrains need to be taken into account (see Section 3.3.2).\n\n5.3.2 A focus on the EU Emissions Trading System\n\nThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tis\ta\tkey\ttool\tfor\treducing\tGHG\temissions\t\nin the EU. It covers heavy energy-using installations \n(power stations and industrial plants) and airlines \noperating between Member States. Altogether, this \nrepresents\tabout\t45\u00a0%\tof\tEU\tGHG\temissions.\n\nThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tis\ta\t'cap\tand\ttrade'\tsystem:\tit\tsets\ta\tcap\ton\t\nemissions from the activities it covers. Then, within the \ncap, companies receive or buy emission allowances. An \nemission\tallowance\tgrants\tthe\tright\tto\temit\t1\u00a0t\u00a0CO2e. \nThe total number of allowances is set by the cap and \nis lower than the historical emissions. Companies \ncan choose to reduce emissions or trade allowances \nwith one another as needed in order to achieve GHG \nemission\treductions\tat\tleast\tcost.\tThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tcap\ton\t\nemissions decreases each year according to a linear \npath. For the period 2013-2020, the total number of \nemission allowances that can be issued each year \ndecreased\tby\t1.74\u00a0%\tper\tyear.\tFrom\t2021\tonwards,\tthe\t\nannual\trate\twill\tbe\t2.2\t%.\tFirst\tintroduced\tin\t2005,\tthe\t\nEU\u00a0ETS\thas\tundergone\tmany\tchanges.\tIt\tis\tcurrently\tin\t\nits third trading period (2013-2020). The next phase will \napply for the period 2021-2030.\n\nThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\taddresses,\tdirectly\tor\tindirectly,\tthe\t\nGHG\temissions\tof\trail\tand\taviation;\tit\tcovers\t\nCO2 emissions resulting from the production \nof electricity used by trains (emissions from \nstationary installations, including electricity \nand heat generation, energy-intensive industry \nand\tsome\tindustrial\tprocesses).\tAbout\t72\u00a0%\tof\t\ntotal rail transport (in terms of train-km) takes \nplace on electrified lines (Schroten et al., 2019). \nBy incentivising the electrification of the rail \ninfrastructure for the Trans-European Transport \nNetwork (TEN-T), the TEN-T policy leads to the \nshifting\tinto\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tof\tGHG\temissions\tderiving\t\nfrom\trail\ttransport.\tThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\talso\tcovers\tCO2 \nemissions from aviation. The initial geographical \nscope\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tcovered\tthe\tCO2 emissions of \nflights from, to and within the European Economic \nArea. To facilitate progress on the development \nof a global market-based measure within the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), \nthe scope was temporarily limited to flights within \nthe European Economic Area (EU-27, Iceland, \nLiechtenstein, Norway and the United Kingdom, \nalthough no decision has yet been made regarding \nthe United Kingdom beyond 2020 (EC, 2020d)) \nuntil\t31\u00a0December\t2023.\tFlights\tto\tand\tfrom\tthe\t\noutermost regions of the EU (e.g. the Azores and \nthe Canary Islands) are covered only if they occur \nin the same outermost region. As outlined in the \nInception impact assessment\tpublished\tin\tJuly\t2020,\t\nthe Commission plans to adopt the proposal for \na\trevision\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tfor\taviation\tby\tJune\t2021\t\n(EC, 2020a). More than one third of EU aviation CO2 \nemissions are currently covered by the system. It \ndoes not address non-CO2 climate effects.\n\nSince 2013, operators from the power generation \nsector must buy all of their allowances through \nauctions, with exceptions for some countries. \nIn other stationary sectors, the proportion of \nallowances auctioned increases progressively.\n\nIn\tthe\taviation\tsector,\tthe\tlarge\tmajority\t(82\u00a0%)\tof\t\nallowances is distributed for free (or 'grandfathered'), \n15\u00a0%\tis\tauctioned\tand\t3\u00a0%\tis\tplaced\tin\ta\tspecial\t\nreserve to provide allowances for new operators or \nfor operators seeing a rapid growth in their activities. \nThis share will also be subject to the review of the \nsystem announced by the European Commission \nin\tJuly\t2020.\tEven\twith\tfreely\tallocated\tallowances,\t\nthe opportunity cost of an emission allowance is \nnot\tequal\tto\tzero\tbut\trather\tto\tthe\tETS\tprice;\tit\tis\t\nthe benefit that one would gain from selling an \nallowance at the ETS price, rather than by using the \nallowance to cover a unit of emissions.\n\f\nTrain or plane?\n\n64 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tincludes\tan\tincentive\tto\tuse\tsustainable\t\naviation fuels. The emission factor associated with such \nfuels for the monitoring of combustion emissions is set to \nzero in the guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of \nGHG emissions. To qualify for this zero-emission factor, \nthe fuel needs to match the sustainability requirements of \nthe Renewable Energy Directive.\n\nAirlines can buy allowances from the other ETS sectors, \nbut the opposite is not allowed for installations until \nthe end of 2020. Some international credits can also be \nexchanged\tby\taircraft\toperators\tfor\tEU\u00a0ETS\temission\t\nallowances\tup\tto\t1.5\u00a0%\tof\ttheir\tverified\temissions\t\nduring the period 2013-2020. In 2019, the aviation \nsector had to buy allowances from the other ETS \nsectors\tfor\t47\u00a0%\tof\tits\temissions,\tcorresponding\tto\t\n32.1\tmegatonnes\tcarbon\tdioxide\tequivalent\t(Mt\u00a0CO2e). \nInternational\tcredits\twere\texchanged\tfor\t0.3\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e \n(EEA, 2020a).\n\nThe market stability reserve\n\nSince 2019, a correction mechanism, called the market \nstability reserve (MSR), has been in place. Because of a \n\nsurplus of permits in the past, due to the 2009 financial \nand economic crisis, among other things, and the low \nprice of emission allowances, the Commission decided \nto limit the number of allowances further, depending \non the surplus, as from 2019. As a result, the price of \nallowances has increased (Bruninx et al., 2020).\n\nThe MSR's operation is based on a set of \npre-determined rules that, when the number of \nallowances exceed a certain threshold, put a proportion \nof the total number of allowances in circulation into \na reserve. This is done to reduce the total number of \nallowances in circulation over time. If the number of \nallowances in circulation falls below a lower threshold, \nallowances are released from the reserve (EEA, 2019b). \nThe size of the MSR is limited (EC, 2019a). If it exceeds a \ncertain limit, a number of allowances will be cancelled \nas of 2023, leading to lower cumulative emissions than \nenvisaged by the cap.\n\nAs the proportion of allowances to be placed in the \nreserve is calculated from emissions from stationary \ninstallations only, aviation emissions have no impact on \nthe allowances that are placed in the MSR.\n\nFigure\t5.10\t Scope\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\n\nSource:  Adapted from Maertens et al.

As air transport is more \ncarbon intensive than electric rail transport, the relative \ncost increase of air transport compared with that of rail \ntransport\tis\thigher\tthan\tin\tthe\tabsence\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS.\t\nHence, this system encourages a modal shift from air to \nrail\ttransport\tfor\tthe\tarea\tcovered\tby\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS.\n\nIn\tthe\tcontext\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS,\tthe\tconsequences\tof\t\na modal shift from plane to train on the number of \navailable allowances, ETS prices and, ultimately, GHG \nemissions are particularly complex to analyse. From a \nsimplistic point of view, the net reduction in emissions \nfor travel realised by the switch from air to rail would \nreduce\tthe\tnet\tdemand\tfor\temission\tallowances;\tthe\t\nfreed-up allowances would become available to other \nETS sectors, which would have the possibility of buying \nthem and increasing their emissions. The total cap on \nemissions, which reflects the EU's ambitions to reduce \nGHG emissions, would continue to be respected.\n\nIn reality, such effects are difficult to analyse, in \nparticular from the quantitative point of view. As \nexplained above, aviation emissions do not affect \nthe number of allowances placed in the MSR and \ntherefore the number of auctioned allowances. In \nthe current context, where the aviation sector is a \nnet buyer of stationary allowances, the reduction in \naviation emissions would reduce the overall demand \nfor auctioned allowances. This would, in turn, be \na factor in decreasing allowance auction prices \n\u2014\tone\tof\u00a0a\trange\tof\tmany\tother\tfactors\taffecting\t\nauction prices. This decreasing effect could be \ncounterbalanced, to a limited extent, by the increased \ndemand for allowances from the power generation \nsector in order to cover for increased electricity use \nresulting from train travel. The demand for allowances \ncould also be affected by the increased emissions \nfrom other industrial ETS sectors contributing to the \nadditional development of railway infrastructure \n(e.g.\u00a0steel\u00a0and\u00a0cement).\n\nThe relative effects of these factors on auction \nprices and their further impact on emissions from \nother sectors could be determined by studying the \nrelative impacts of various parameters to draw clear \nconclusions on the overall impact of a modal shift \nfrom aviation to rail. The overall effect of a decrease in \naviation emissions would depend on the magnitude of \nthe decrease.\n\nAlthough there are uncertainties regarding the \nconsequences\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tfor\tthe\tenvironmental\t\ncosts of rail and air transport within the European \nEconomic Area, the impacts of a modal shift from plane \nto train are much clearer for those environmental costs \nnot\tcovered\tby\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS.\tThese\tconsist\tof\tthe\tnoise\t\ncosts and the air pollution costs and for aviation they \nalso include the non-CO2 climate costs.\n\f\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?66\n\nFurther considerations and recommendations\n\n6 Further considerations and \nrecommendations\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nThe environmental performance of rail and air \npassenger transport presented in this report is a \nsnapshot of the current situation. Therefore, it is \nimportant to also consider how this picture may \nchange\u00a0in\tthe\tfuture.\tThis\tis\tdiscussed\tin\tSection\t6.2.\n\nIn addition, given the better environmental \nperformance of rail compared with air travel, this \nchapter considers how the shift from air to rail can be \npromoted. This is the topic of Section 6.3.\n\nA general consideration is that policymaking in this \nfield requires good data. For air transport, Eurostat \npublishes a relatively extensive data set at various \nlevels of detail, although data on air travel per distance \nclass are not readily available. For rail transport, the \npublicly available data are more limited. These data \ngaps make assessing the situation today and evaluating \nexisting and new policy options more difficult.\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 The environmental performance of rail and air transport can be expected to improve in the future. Alongside market \nmechanisms, policies play an important role by providing incentives for the development and adoption of new \ntechnologies and fuels. Better traffic management, more efficient operations and other actions can also improve the \nenvironmental sustainability of rail and air transport.\n\n\u2022 Confronting rail and air travellers with the non-internalised environmental costs of their travel choices is an important \nway to strike a balance between rail and air transport.\n\n\u2022 Travel time cost and travel time reliability are the key parameters that influence modal choice. Improving the efficiency \nand reliability of rail passenger transport and making it more seamless across European borders is key to increasing its \nattractiveness. Factors such as convenience, comfort, quality of service and safety also merit additional attention.\n\n\u2022 Although some of the approaches to increase rail travel's speed and capacity can be implemented in the short to \nmedium term, many require substantial investments and take a long time. The same applies for the (re-)introduction of \nnight trains, which could offer a strategy to deal with longer rail travel times. In all cases the social benefits should be \ncompared with the social costs, including the environmental costs.\n\n6.2 What factors influence the future \nenvironmental performance of \nthese\u00a0modes?\n\nThe environmental performance of rail and air travel as \npresented in Chapter 5 can be expected to change in \nthe future. This will be the case not only for rail and air \ntransport but also for the other modes of transport.\n\nFor air transport, the future environmental \nperformance depends on further technical \nimprovements in aircraft design and technology, \nincluding a possible move to electric, hybrid electric \nor hydrogen-powered aircraft for some market \nsegments, improvements in air traffic management, \nimprovements\tin\tair\ttransport\toperations\t(e.g.\u00a0changes\t\nin the occupancy rates of the aircraft), and the uptake \nof sustainable aviation fuels. Depending on the \nconversion technology and the type of feedstock, such \nfuels could realise a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions\tof\tbetween\t26\u00a0%\tand\t94\u00a0%\t(EASA\u00a0et\tal.,\t2019).\t\n\f\nFurther considerations and recommendations\n\n67Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nHowever, these figures do not yet take into account \nnegative effects from (in)direct land use change. \nRecently, the role that synthetic fuels produced with \nrenewable energy could play in the longer term has \nalso attracted a lot of attention. The extent to which \nthese developments take place will be influenced to a \nlarge degree by policies. The policies currently in place, \nincluding the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), have \nbeen discussed in Chapter 4, but further incentives for \nresearch and development (R&D) of new technologies \nand sustainable aviation fuels, as well as other \nincentives for the uptake of these technologies and \nfuels, would accelerate change further. For example, \nfor sustainable aviation fuels, various options exist, \nsuch as a fuel facilitation initiative, a fuel monitoring \nsystem, subsidies for such fuels, an auctioning \nsystem or an aviation-specific blending mandate \n(EASA,\u00a02020a,\u00a02020b;\tEC,\t2020h).\n\nIn the rail sector, further improvements can also be \nexpected. For rail transport, the further electrification \nof rail and the fact that electric rail transport is \nindirectly\tincluded\tin\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS,\twith\ta\tdecreasing\tcap,\t\nwill reduce the climate impacts. The Renewable Energy \nDirective also aims to reduce the climate impact of \nelectricity production. In addition, the environmental \nperformance will be determined by the standards that \nare set for new trains and by the measures that are \ntaken to reduce noise exposure. The environmental \nperformance will also depend on the evolution of \noccupancy rates, as for air transport.\n\n6.3 Actions and policies to promote a \nmore environmentally sustainable \nmodal choice\n\nThe promotion of rail transport over air transport, in \nthe light of its better environmental performance, must \nbuild on an understanding of the factors that play a \nrole when people make travel choices. As discussed in \nSection\u00a02.4.1,\tthe\tmain\tfactors\tinfluencing\tthe\tmodal\t\nchoice are price, travel time, travel time reliability, \nfrequency of the connections and other factors such \nas convenience, comfort and safety (Clewlow et al., \n2014;\tGivoni\tand\tDobruszkes,\t2013;\tSavelberg\tand\tde\t\nLange,\u00a02018).\n\nAs discussed in Section 2.4, in some cases the presence \nof a high-speed rail (HSR) connection leads to fewer \nair services or could even result in discontinuing the \nair link. In the latter case the modal choice is between \nrail and road transport. The same situation would \narise if governments put conditions on the air services \nthat can still be offered for connections with a good \nrail connection. For example, in France the state aid \nprovided to Air France during the COVID-19 crisis is \n\nconditional on its limiting domestic flights between \ncities connected by a rail journey of less than 2.5 hours \n(RailExpress, 2020).\n\nConsidering then the case in which people do have \nthe choice between rail and air transport, it is useful \nto consider in more detail what the factors influencing \nmodal choice are.\n\nThe first factor is the travel cost. Both for rail and air \ntravel, the direct financial cost is the ticket price. Given \nyield management strategies, there is high variability \nin fares. Fares depend on the time of booking and the \ntime of travel, whether the trip can be changed and \nrefunded or not, etc. Supplements often apply for air \ntravel if one wishes to reserve a seat or take luggage.\n\nFor aviation, most countries in the European Economic \nArea charge value added tax (VAT) on domestic flights, \nwith many countries applying lower rates than the \nstandard VAT rates (CE Delft and SEO Amsterdam \nEconomics, 2019). International air travellers do not \npay VAT, and only Norway and Switzerland levy a tax \non jet fuel for domestic flights. For travel in the area \ncovered\tby\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS,\trail\tand\tair\toperators\tare\t(in)\ndirectly\tconfronted\twith\ta\tcarbon\tprice\tvia\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS\t\nallowance cost. Depending on the pricing policies of \nthe rail and air companies, this cost will form part of \nthe\tticket\tprice.\tThe\tEU\u00a0ETS\tcurrently\tapplies\tonly\tto\t\nflights within the European Economic Area. The future \nimpact of CORSIA (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction \nScheme for International Aviation) is still uncertain and \nit has not yet been decided how it will relate to the \nEU\u00a0ETS.\tHowever,\tthe\toffset\tprice\twill\tincrease\tthe\tcosts\t\nfor airlines, which then also have to decide to what \nextent they want to let their customers pay for this, as \nin\tthe\tcase\tof\tthe\tEU\u00a0ETS.\n\nUsing taxes to confront travellers with the \nnon-internalised environmental costs of their travel \nis an important way to create a balance between rail \nand\u00a0air\ttransport.\n\nThe second factor is travel time cost and travel time \nreliability. Travel time costs take into account the \ntotal travel time and the fact that different parts of the \njourney may be perceived as more costly than others. \nFor example, the perceived time costs are higher \nfor unpleasant or cumbersome parts of the journey \n(especially when one travels with luggage), such as \ntransfers, the need to hurry to make a transfer and \ntime required for security procedures. Apart from the \ntravel time cost, the reliability of travel time also plays \na role, which depends on congestion, incidents, etc. \nAction can be taken to improve rail travel time costs to \nmake it a more attractive choice.\n\f\nFurther considerations and recommendations\n\n68 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nFor air travel, the time flying is only part of the \ntravel time. Travel time to and from the airport, as \nwell as check-in time and time required for security \nprocedures and luggage collection cause the total air \ntravel time to be significantly longer than the time \nspent flying. Usually people experience this extra time \nas more bothersome than the time spent flying. The \nFlightpath 2050 vision (EC, 2011a) sets a concrete goal \nthat\t'90\u00a0%\tof\ttravellers\tshould\tbe\table\tto\tcomplete\t\ntheir journey door-to-door within 4 hours throughout \nEurope'. It adds that 'Passengers \u2026 are able to transfer \nseamlessly between transport modes to reach the \nfinal destination smoothly, predictably and on-time.' \nSuch ambitions make it even more imperative to \nimprove the travel time experience by rail.\n\nFor rail travel, the journey to and from the railway \nstation can be shorter than that to the airport. \nHowever, as discussed in Section 5.3.2, the distance \ntravelled for first and last mile travel depends on the \npoint of origin and destination and whether they are \nclose to the railway station. Usually when travelling \nby rail there is no extra time required for check-in, \nsecurity and luggage reclaim. However, time spent on \nthe train can be substantially longer and, if transfers \nneed to be made, transfer time is experienced as \nmore bothersome than the time on the train. In \ncontrast, when travelling by train there may be more \npossibilities to work or relax than when travelling in \neconomy class by air.\n\nRail travel time can be improved in various ways \n(APPM and Goudappel Coffeng, 2015), either by \nimproving the efficiency of use of the existing \ninfrastructure or by making changes in the \ninfrastructure. Operators can improve the travel \ntime costs by offering more direct connections or \nreducing the number of stops. The latter, of course, \nmeans that people that use these stops then have to \nmake a transfer. Travel time can also be improved by \nimproving cross-border travel and ensuring better \ninteroperability, which the railway packages adopted \nat the EU level aim to realise. Other ways are to \nincrease the speed on tracks where trains still run \nslower than the maximum speed, to increase the \nmaximum speed of existing tracks, to build additional \npassing tracks that faster trains can use to pass \nslower trains or to provide new high-speed services \non\tnew\thigh-speed\ttracks.\tRegarding\tHSR,\tFigure\u00a02.3\t\nin Chapter 2 presents the connections in the EU for \nwhich a further expansion of HSR infrastructure \nis planned. From this discussion, it is clear that in \naddition to the role for train operators, there are \nalso roles for the EU, national governments and \nnetwork\u00a0operators.\n\nAnother strategy to deal with longer rail travel \ntimes for longer distances (e.g. between 800 and \n1 200 km) is an increased use of night trains. The \ntime and money cost of travel is then compensated \nfor by saving the cost of hotel accommodation. \nFor example, a recent report identified eight \ndestinations that could potentially be served from the \nNetherlands: Copenhagen, Milan, Munich, Prague, \nTurin,\tVienna,\tWarsaw\tand\tZurich\t(Savelberg,\u00a02019).\t\nAnother example is the study by UIC and DB \nInternational (2013) on the potential for operating \nvery-long-distance night trains on high-speed \nnetworks. In the study for the Netherlands, Savelberg \n(2019) points out that there are still a number of \nbarriers, some of which are also mentioned in the \nstudy by UIC and DB International (2013). More \nspecifically, night trains are costly to operate. To \nthese costs, high infrastructure charges are added \non account of the long distance and the presence \nof additional charges on top of the base tariff. The \nstudy also points out that the operators that were \nconsulted consider the infrastructure charges high, \nalthough they do not yet cover all infrastructure costs. \nA point raised by the operators was the lack of a \nlevel playing field with air transport. Another barrier \nhas to do with competition from regular rail services \nfor the capacity of the infrastructure because both \nservices run on the same infrastructure. The study \nestimates that, if these barriers are removed, in the \nlong\trun\t0.7-1\u00a0million\ttrips\tper\tyear\tcould\tbe\tmade\t\nby night train on these connections (Savelberg, 2019). \nHowever, the noise impacts of night trains are larger \nthan for similar trains during the day, because of the \nlower background noise levels and the health impacts \nof sleep disturbance (see Figure 3.10).\n\nAlthough some of the approaches to increase rail travel \nspeed can be relatively cheap and quick to implement, \nothers require substantial investment and take more \ntime. The same applies for the (re-)introduction of \nnight trains. In all cases, the social benefits should \nbe compared with the social costs, including the \nenvironmental costs. A report by the ECA (2018) points \nout that a good assessment of the costs and benefits is \noften lacking and stresses the need for a cost-benefit \nanalysis to support decisions. Moreover, it points to the \nimportance of coordination across borders. In the case \nof investments in new HSR infrastructure, Chapter 2 \nidentified the conditions that ensure that the GHG costs \nembedded in the construction of the infrastructure \nare compensated for by a reduction in emissions from \ntravelling. When assessing the emission impacts of \ntravelling, account must also be taken of the expected \nfuture developments in the emission factors for the \ndifferent modes of transport.\n\f\nFurther considerations and recommendations\n\n69Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nThe frequency of the service is another factor that \ninfluences the modal choice. Car transport is very \nflexible in that respect. However, in the case of rail \nand air transport, travel is according to set train \nschedules and flight plans. The frequency determines \nhow many passengers can be transported (together \nwith the capacity of the train/aircraft). A schedule with \nhigher frequency services is more likely to correspond \nto travellers' desired time schedule. If that is not the \ncase, so-called schedule delay costs arise, because \none arrives earlier or later than desired. A higher \nfrequency also reduces the transfer time between two \njourney\u00a0legs.\t\n\nAnother way of motivating people to make \nenvironmentally sustainable choices is to provide \ninformation on the environmental impacts of their \nmodal choice in order to increase their awareness \nof the problems. For example, the European Union \nAviation Safety Agency (EASA) was recently tasked \nby the Commission to work on the concept of \nenvironmental labelling in line with EU policies and \nwith a view to allowing intermodal comparisons \n(EASA,\u00a02019).\tAnother\texample\tis\tthe\tEcoPassenger\t\nplatform developed for the International Union of \nRailways (UIC, 2020a).\n\nFinally, factors such as convenience, comfort, \nquality of service and safety play a role in modal \nchoices. These factors are generally more difficult \nto quantify but should not be ignored. How easy is \nit to find information on travel routes and fares and \nto book trips? Is there integrated ticketing and rail \ntravel planning across borders? What is the quality \nof information available before booking a trip and \nalso during the trip, especially in the case of delays \nor cancellations? Is there financial compensation \nin the case of missed connections and how easily \ncan it be obtained? How much luggage can one \ntake and how easy is it to travel with luggage? \nHow comfortable and safe is it to travel? These are \nfactors under the control of transport operators, \nbut policies also form a framework for them to \nwork in.\n\nA good understanding of each of these factors is \nessential for bringing about the desired shift to the \nmost sustainable modes of transport. This report \nsought to explore a shift from air to rail transport \nand the environmental and health benefits that it \ncould bring about. By doing so, its authors hope to \ncontribute to the important debate on how to make \nEurope's mobility system fit for the future.\n\f\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?70\n\nAbbreviations, symbols and units\n\nAbbreviations, symbols and units\n\n\u00b5m Micrometre\nATM Air traffic management\nCCD Climb, cruise, descent\nCEF Connecting Europe Facility\nCER Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies\nCO Carbon monoxide\nCO2 Carbon dioxide\nCO2e Carbon dioxide equivalent\nCORSIA Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation\nCOVID-19 Coronavirus disease 2019\ndB Decibel\nEASA European Union Aviation Safety Agency\nECA European Court of Auditors\nEEA European Environment Agency\nEFTA European Free Trade Association\nEIB European Investment Bank\nEND Environmental Noise Directive\nERA European Railway Agency\nERDF European Regional Development Fund\nESIF European Structural and Investment Fund\nETS Emissions Trading System\nEU European Union\nft Feet\ng Gram\nGDP Gross domestic product\nGHG Greenhouse gas\nGRACE Generalisation of Research on Accounts and Cost Estimation\nHC Hydrocarbon\nHSR High-speed rail\nIATA International Air Transport Association\nICAO International Civil Aviation Organization\nIC Intercity train\nICe Intercity electric train\nIEA International Energy Agency\nILUC Indirect land use change\nIZT Institute for Future Studies and Technology Assessment (Germany)\nJU Joint\tundertaking\nkg Kilogram\nKiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis\n\f\nAbbreviations, symbols and units\n\n71Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nkm Kilometre\nKPI Key performance indicator\nkWh Kilowatt-hour\nl Litre\nLCA Life cycle analysis\nLden Day- evening-night-level indicator of noise\nLnight Night-level indicator of noise\nLTO Landing and take-off\nLULUCF Land use, land use change and forestry\nMJ Megajoule\nMSR Market stability reserve\nMt Million tonnes\nMtCO2e Megatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent\nNH3 Ammonia\nN2O Nitrous oxide\nNMVOC Non-methane volatile organic compound\nNOx Nitrogen oxides\nNRMM Non-road mobile machinery\nnvPM Non-volatile particulate matter\nPAH Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\nPb Lead\nPM Particulate matter\nPM2.5 Particulate\tmatter\twith\ta\tdiameter\tof\t2.5\u00a0\u03bcm\tor\tless\nPM10 Particulate\tmatter\twith\ta\tdiameter\tof\t10\u00a0\u03bcm\tor\tless\nR&D Research and development\nRED Renewable Energy Directive\nRPK Revenue passenger-km\nRTK Revenue tonne-km\nS2R Shift2Rail\nSAF Sustainable aviation fuel\nSDG Sustainable Development Goal\nSES Single European Sky initiative\nSESAR Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research\nSO2 Sulphur dioxide\nSOx Sulphur oxides\nt Tonne\nT&E Transport & Environment\nTEN-T Trans-European Transport Network\nTERM Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism\nTSP Total suspended particles\nUIC International Union of Railways\nUN United Nations\nTTW Tank-to-wheel\nVAT Value added tax\nvkm Vehicle-kilometre\nWHO World Health Organization\nWTT Well-to-tank\nWTW Well-to-wheel/-wake\n\f\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?72\n\nReferences\n\nReferences\n\nAir France, 2020, 'Can I offset CO2 emissions related to \nmy Air France trip?', AirFrance (https://www.airfrance.\nbe/BE/en/common/faq/about-air-france/can-i-calculateco2-emissions-related-to-my-trip-with-air-france.htm) \naccessed 1 October 2020.\n\nAlbalate, D., et al., 2015, 'Competition and cooperation \nbetween high-speed rail and air transportation \nservices in Europe', Journal of Transport Geography 42, \npp.\u00a0166-174\t(DOI:\t10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.07.003).\n\nAPPM and Goudappel Coffeng, 2015, Van toplocatie \nnaar internationale bestemming per spoor.

For air transport, the \ndistance is based on data provided by Eurocontrol. \nFor rail transport, the distance via the rail network is \ndifficult\tto\tobtain;\ttherefore,\tthe\tdistance\tis\tcurrently\t\napproximated by the car distance.\n\nFor transport to and from the main railway station or \nairport, the distance by car from the city centre to the \nmain railway station or airport is used. Three modes \nare considered: car, bus and (heavy) rail. If travel \ndistances are short they can also be covered on foot, in \n\nwhich case the environmental impact Is zero. However, \npeople may also choose to use another mode, even for \nshort distances, when they have to take luggage. No \naccount could be taken of the actual travel options and \ntravel distances in each case, as this information could \nnot be obtained from online route planners during the \nCOVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, the findings for travel to \nand from the main railway stations or airports should \nbe seen as approximations.\n\nAircraft types and train types for main trip \nbetween\u00a0city\u00a0pairs\n\nTable A1.1 gives an overview of the aircraft used in the \ndifferent city pairs, as well as their capacity and the \noccupancy assumed in the calculations.\n\f\nInputs for calculating the environmental costs per trip\n\n79Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nTable A1.1 Aircraft types, capacity and occupancy\n\nAircraft type Abbreviation Maximum capacity Typical capacity Source\n\nAirbus A320 A320 189 150-180 Airbus\twebsite\u00a0(a)\n\nAirbus A321 A321 220 180-220 Airbus\twebsite\u00a0(b)\n\nBoeing 737-800 B738 189 162-189 Boeing\twebsite\u00a0(c)\n\nEmbraer E190 E190 114 96-114 Embraer\twebsite\u00a0(d)\n\nBoeing 737-700 B737 149 126-149 Boeing\twebsite\u00a0(e)\n\nAirbus A319 A319neo 160 120-150 Airbus\twebsite\u00a0(f)\n\nEmbraer EMB 120 Brasilia E120 31 31 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(g)\n\nBoeing B757-200 B752 234 169-234 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(h)\n\nEmbraer E195 E195 124 100-124 Embraer\twebsite\u00a0(i)\n\nAirbus A318 A318 132 90-110 Airbus\twebsite\u00a0(j)\n\nBoeing 737-400 B734 144 144 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(k)\n\nFokker 100 F100 100 100 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(l)\n\nBoeing 737-300 B733 148 148 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(m)\n\nAirbus A330-200 A332 406 210-250 Airbus\twebsite\u00a0(n)\n\nAirbus A300-600 A306 345 210-250 Airbus\twebsite\u00a0(o)\n\nBombardier\tCRJ-900 CRJ9 76 76 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(p)\n\nATR 72-600 ATR72 78 44-78 ATR\taircraft\twebsite\u00a0(q)\n\nBombardier\tCRJ-700 CRJ7 65 63-65 Seatguru\twebsite\u00a0(r)\n\nEmbraer\tERJ-175 E75S 80 76-80 Seatguru website (s)\n\nNotes: (a) https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a320-family/a320neo.html\n\n (b) https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a320-family/a321neo.html\n\n (c) https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737ng/\n\n (d) https://www.embraercommercialaviation.com/commercial-jets/e190/\n\n (e) https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737ng/\n\n (f) https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a320-family/a319neo.html\n\n (g) https://seatguru.com/airlines/United_Airlines/United_Airlines_Embraer_EMB-120.php\n\n (h) https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Delta_Airlines/Delta_Airlines_Boeing_757-300_75Y.php\n\n (i) https://www.embraercommercialaviation.com/commercial-jets/e195/\n\n (j) https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a320-family/a318.html\n\n (k) https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/LOT_Polish_Airlines/LOT_Polish_Airlines_Boeing_737-400.php\n\n (l) https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Virgin_Australia/Virgin_Australia_Fokker_F100.php\n\n\t (m)\thttps://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Jet2com/Jet2_Boeing_737-300.php\n\n (n) https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a330-family/a330-200.html\n\n (o) https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/previous-generation-aircraft/a300-600.html\n\n\t (p)\thttps://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Delta_Airlines/Delta_Airlines_Canadair_CRJ900_C.php\n\n (q) http://www.atraircraft.com/products/ATR-72-600.html\n\n\t (r)\thttps://www.seatguru.com/airlines/American_Airlines/American_Airlines_CRJ700.php\n\n (s) https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/American_Airlines/American_Airlines_Embraer_EMB-175.php\n\f\nInputs for calculating the environmental costs per trip\n\n80 Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nTable A1.2 presents the aircraft considered for \neach city pair.

The \naircraft types reported are those for which emission \nfactors are available in EEA (2019a) (more specifically \nAnnex 5 for 1.A.3.a Aviation). This means that the \naircraft type ranked first for a certain city pair is the \ntype for which emission factors are available and is \nused most for the city pair. It could be that another \naircraft type is used more often, but that no emission \nfactors are available in the calculator. The same \napplies to aircraft types 2-5.\n\nThe aircraft types reported in the table were used on \nthe trajectories to calculate the emissions and the costs \nrelated to these emissions.\n\nThe column 'HSR or IC' in the table indicates whether \nthere is a high-speed rail (HSR) connection available \non the specific trajectory or an intercity train (IC). This \ninformation was deducted from the Trainline website \nand a popular web mapping service.\n\nFinally, the last column, 'Occupancy rate', presents the \naverage occupancy rate for the airport pairs in 2018, as \nderived from Eurostat (2020a).\n\nTable A1.2  Most frequently used aircraft per city pair and type of fastest rail connection \n\nOrigin Destination\n\nA\nir\n\ncr\naf\n\nt \n1\n\nA\nir\n\ncr\naf\n\nt \n2\n\nA\nir\n\ncr\naf\n\nt \n3\n\nA\nir\n\ncr\naf\n\nt \n4\n\nA\nir\n\ncr\naf\n\nt \n5\n\nH\nSR\n\n o\nr \n\nIC\n\nO\ncc\n\nup\nan\n\ncy\n \n\nra\nte\n\t(%\n\n)\n\nAmsterdam Paris B738 A321 A319 B737 A320 HSR 86\n\nAmsterdam Copenhagen B738 B737 A320 E190 A20N IC 83\n\nAthens Thessaloniki A320 A319 A321 B738 E120 IC 80\n\nBarcelona Paris A320 A321 A20N B752 A319 HSR 87\n\nBerlin Vienna A320 A319 E195 A321 E190 IC 70\n\nBrussels Frankfurt am Main A320 CRJ9 A20N A319 A321 HSR 71\n\nBucharest Cluj-Napoca B738 AT45 A318 B734 B737 IC 76\n\nBudapest Frankfurt am Main A321 A320 E190 A319 CRJ9 IC 76\n\nCopenhagen Stockholm A320 A319 B737 A318 B738 HSR 66\n\nFrankfurt am Main Hamburg A321 A320 A20N A319 A21N HSR 74\n\nFrankfurt am Main Ljubljana CRJ9 A319 CRJ7 F100 SB20 IC 67\n\nKrakow Warsaw DH8D E195 C295 E75S B738 HSR 74\n\nLyon Paris A320 A319 A321 B733 A318 HSR 81\n\nMadrid Barcelona A320 A321 A20N A332 B738 HSR 80\n\nMadrid Lisbon A320 E195 A319 A321 A20N IC 84\n\nMilan Paris A320 A318 A319 A306 E75S HSR 84\n\nOslo Stockholm B738 A20N B737 A320 CRJ9 IC 66\n\nMilan Vienna A320 B738 A321 A319 A20N HSR 63\n\nSofia Varna E190 A319 B733 A320 BE20 IC 80\n\nVienna Zurich A320 A319 A321 E190 BCS3 IC 77\n\nNote:  See\tTable\tA1.1\tfor\tdefinitions\tof\tthe\tabbreviations\tof\tthe\taircraft\ttypes.\n\nSources: Eurocontrol,\tTrainline/web\tmapping\tservice;\tEurostat\t(2020a).\n\f\nInputs for calculating the environmental costs per trip\n\n81Transport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nEmission factors and fuel consumption\n\nFor cars with an internal combustion engine, buses \nand aeroplanes the emission factors and fuel \nconsumption per kilometre are taken from the EEA \nemission inventory guidebook 2019 (EEA, 2019a).

In the calculations the following cost \nfactors are used:\n\n\u2022 Cars: the city factor is used in all the cases, also on \nthe main trajectory.\n\n\u2022 Buses: buses are used only on pre- and posttrajectories and therefore the cost factors are the \nsame as those that hold in cities.\n\n\u2022 Trains:\n\n \u2013 The air pollutant emissions of electricity production \nare not yet taken into account. When they are \ntaken into account at a later stage, the cost factor \nfrom EC (2019d) for the well-to-tank emissions \n\nwill be used, which makes no distinction between \nmetropolitan, city and rural areas.\n\n \u2013 Diesel trains are used only for pre- and posttransport in some cases and therefore the city \nfactors are used for the air pollution cost factors.\n\n\u2022 Aircraft:\n\n \u2013 The air pollution costs are taken into account \nonly during the LTO phase. Because airports are \nmainly located outside the city centre, the cost \nfactors chosen are the rural factors.\n\n \u2013 For the climb, cruise, descent (CCD) phase the \nair pollution costs are not taken into account. \nCurrently, the impacts of air pollution at high \naltitude have not been sufficiently well studied to \nmake a good cost estimation for them.\n\nTable A1.10  Average noise costs per transport mode \n\nMode Unit Value\n\nPassenger car\nEUR/vehicle-km\n\n0.009\n\nBus 0.08\n\nHigh-speed train\n\nEUR/train-km\n\n0.97\n\nElectric train 1.06\n\nDiesel train 0.81\n\nAircraft EUR/LTO 257\n\nSource: EC (2019d).\n\f\n87\n\nEnvironmental costs per city pair\n\nTransport and environment report 2020 \u2014 Train or plane?\n\nAnnex 2 Environmental costs per city pair\n\nFigure\tA2.1\t\t Environmental\tcosts\tof\tmain\ttrip\tand\tpre/post\ttransport\t\u2014\t(1)\tKrakow-Warsaw\n\nSource:  EEA.\n\nBus\n\nBus\n\nCar_diesel (1P)\n\nCar_diesel (1P) Train_ICe\n\nTrain_ICe\n\n284\n\nATR72 ATR72 ATR72\n\nTrain_ICe\n\nTrain_ICe\n\nTrain_ICe\n\nMain trip segment\nLast trip segment\n\nFirst trip segment\n\nTransport\n\nDistance (km) 293\n\nCar_diesel (1P)\n\nCar_diesel (1P) Train_ICe\n\nTrain_ICeTrain_HSR Train_HSR\n\n296\n\nBus\n\nBus\n\nTrain_ICe\n\nBus\n\nBus Car_diesel (1P)\n\nCar_diesel (1P)\n\nTrain_HSR\nCar_diesel (1P) Train_ICe\n\n11.75 \u20ac 12.57 \u20ac 11.69 \u20ac\n11.96 \u20ac\n\n1.42 \u20ac 2.49 \u20ac 2.55 \u20ac 1.47 \u20ac 1.42 \u20ac 2.49 \u20ac\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nClimate non-CO2 (medium) Main trip (excluding climate non-CO2)\n\nTotal (low climate non-CO2) Total (high climate non-CO2)\n\nTotal cost first segment\n\nTotal cost last segment\n\nEuros per \npassenger \n\nThis annex gives the environmental costs for all main \nand alternative city pairs, with a distinction according \nto the environmental costs for transport to/from the \nrailway station (pre- and post-transport) and for the \nmain trip.
