However, there are no signs that the overall objective of reducing the total generation of waste is close to being achieved, according to a European Environment Agency report published today. The report\u2019s findings highlight opportunities to more effectively prevent waste, with textiles in the spotlight.\nPreventing waste is a key part of Europe\u2019s strategy in shifting to a resource-efficient and climate-neutral circular economy. Waste generation across Europe increased by 5.2% between 2014 and 2018, while GDP increased by 14.8 % in the EU according to the EEA reportThe same data trends also show that the adoption of the first waste prevention programmes by countries, applicable in most EU countries from 2013 or earlier, was insufficient to decrease the amount of waste generated.\nThe analysis shows that waste generation is still very dependent on developments in the economy, but, overall, the EU has been able to achieve a waste generation growth lower than the economic growth, or a so-called relative decoupling. Still, more needs to be done to ensure that waste decreases in real terms in a growing economy. The adoption of concrete targets \u2014 a strong driver of policy making \u2014 would help consolidate prevention policy at EU and national level.\nThe EEA analysis looked at national waste prevention programmes and specifically waste streams in focus, indicators, targets, and measures to prevent waste. The review revealed that, as of this year, 10 out of the 32 countries examined do not have a waste prevention programme in place, as required by EU legislation.\nTextile waste would benefit greatly from improved measures to prevent waste , as this is a fast-growing, environmentally impactful waste stream associated with unsustainable consumption patterns. The average European generates approximately 11 kg of textile waste per year.\nPreventing textile waste has great potential, mainly through reducing textile consumption, eco-design and ultimately reuse. To facilitate this, emphasis should be put on product design to promote durable and long-lasting materials, while support should be given to repair (e.g. with use of tax breaks) and reuse (e.g. through regulations).\nA separate EEA briefing, also published today, looks at the state of play for the trading of non-hazardous, recyclable waste within the EU. The briefing, besides supporting the ongoing review by the European Commission of the EU\u2019s Waste Shipment Regulation, offers insights on recyclables trading in the EU as well as potential solutions to help ensure that waste is treated in the best possible way in line with the principles of the waste hierarchy.\nMore than 90% of waste generated in the EU is treated in the country in which it was generated, respecting the EU\u2019s 'proximity principle' underpinning EU waste law. However, cross-border trading of non-hazardous, recyclable waste offers opportunities to find the environmentally-optimal treatment options, allowing good-quality secondary raw materials to be produced and respecting the principles of a circular economy.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/clear-opportunities-to-decouple-europes or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:07 AM\nFiled under: waste generation waste prevention waste hierarchy circular economy textile waste secondary raw materials\nFiled under: waste generation, waste prevention, waste hierarchy, circular economy, textile waste, secondary raw materials\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Waste prevention is the best waste management policy option, according to the waste hierarchy, the EU's main rule for the environmental ranking of waste management policies.

of textile waste prevention\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 The EU as a whole and many individual countries have achieved a relative decoupling of waste generation from \neconomic growth. However, there are no signs that the overall objective of reducing waste generation in a growing \neconomy is close to being achieved.\n\n\u2022 Data for trends in waste generation show no observable link between the adoption of waste prevention \nprogrammes by countries in 2013 and the amount of waste generated. In fact, waste generation, excluding major \nmineral wastes, increased by 5.2\u00a0% between 2014 and 2018 in the EU.\n\n\u2022 In mid-2021, 10 out of the 32 countries examined did not have a waste prevention programme in place, although all \nEU Member States had one in place earlier. This might be the result of countries deciding to align waste prevention \npolicies with waste management plans or circular economy strategies, which can unlock synergetic effects.\n\n\u2022 The introduction of solid quantitative prevention targets at the EU level would help consolidate prevention efforts \nin European countries and promote a comprehensive prevention policy, including measures and indicators, driven \nby the objective of fulfilling the target.\n\n\u2022 Textile waste would benefit greatly from waste prevention measures, as this is a fast-growing, environmentally \nimpactful waste stream associated with unsustainable consumption patterns. The average European generates \napproximately 11\u00a0kg of textile waste annually.\n\n\u2022 Preventing textile waste has great potential, mainly through reducing consumption, eco-design and ultimately \nreuse. To facilitate this, emphasis should be put on product design to promote durable and long-lasting materials, \nwhile support should be given to repair (e.g. tax breaks) and reuse (e.g. regulation).\n\f\n\u00a9 Beth Barkway, Environment & Me/EEA\n\f\n9Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nExecutive summary\n\nWaste prevention is the best waste management policy option, \naccording to the waste hierarchy, the EU's main rule for the \nenvironmental ranking of waste management policies. Its main \nobjective is to reduce waste generation, the environmental \nimpacts of waste management and the hazardousness of the \nwaste generated. It is mainly expressed as the aspiration to \nbreak the link between waste generation and economic growth \n(decoupling). To support this objective, the EU and all is Member \nStates have put in place legislation that promotes activities in \nproducts' life cycles aimed at reducing the amount of waste \ngenerated. At the national level, these policies are described \nin national or regional waste prevention programmes, which \nhave been in place in most of the countries examined since at \nleast\u00a02013.\n\nThis report aims to assess progress towards waste prevention \nmeasures' main objective of decoupling, scoping the EU as \na whole by synthesising information from national waste \nprevention measures, targets, indicators and targeted waste \nstreams. Our analysis shows that waste generation at the \nEU level is still very dependent on developments in the \neconomy,\tas\texpressed\tthrough\tgross\tdomestic\tproduct\u00a0(GDP).\t\nThe EU has achieved a relative decoupling, meaning that \nwaste generation is growing, albeit at a slower pace than \nthe economy. However, there are no signs that absolute \ndecoupling, meaning that waste is decreasing in a growing \neconomy, is close to being achieved at the EU level. Moreover, \nthere is no observable effect of the wide adoption by countries \nof waste prevention programmes since at least 2013, as waste \ngeneration, excluding major mineral wastes, has increased by \n5.7\u00a0%\tin\tthe\t4\tyears\tbetween\t2014\tand\t2018.\tAt\tthe\tnational\t\nlevel, changes in population have not been large enough to \nsufficiently explain the changes in waste intensity, defined as \nthe amount of waste generated per unit of GDP. Overall, only \n7 out of 30 countries showed an increase in waste intensity \n(more waste generated per unit GDP) between 2008 and 2018, \nwhile 12 countries showed a strong (more than 10 percentage \npoints)\u00a0decrease.\n\nThe national/regional waste prevention programmes have \nbeen analysed with respect to the waste streams in focus, \nindicators, targets and waste prevention measures. This \nexamination revealed that 10 out of the 32 countries reviewed \ndo not have a waste prevention programme in place (based on \ndata from 2021). To date, only 10 countries have updated their \nwaste prevention programmes according to the revised Waste \nFramework Directive ((EU) 2018/851). Updated programmes \n\nshow a higher tendency to set quantitative targets when there \nwere solely qualitative targets before, indicating a stronger \nmovement towards waste prevention. While informative \nmeasures and awareness-raising are the most used measure \ntypes in Member States, we found that the number of newly \ninitiated voluntary agreements has decreased slightly. Finally, \nwith regard to specific waste streams, measures addressing \nplastic packaging waste, food waste and waste electronic \nproducts in particular have gained in importance.\n\nWith regard to the new focus area of food waste, it has been \nshown that most countries are already active in promoting food \nwaste prevention. The measures implemented, however, have \nbeen evaluated as relatively light and tend to focus on voluntary \ncommitments or information provision. With the food waste \nprevention programmes currently developed across Europe, it \nis expected that food waste prevention policy will be designed \nin a more systematic manner and that more effective measures, \ntargets and data collection systems for food waste will be \nintroduced. Prevention of waste through reuse, which is the \nsecond new focus area, has gained importance for a number \nof product groups. Analysis has, however, revealed divergent \nframeworks depending on product group, with reuse already \nestablished and a central part of the market for certain product \ngroups (e.g. for cars) and still in its infancy for others. However, \nthe recent focus of EU legislation on reuse is expected to \nmotivate EU Member States to intensify their efforts, especially \nwith respect to product groups addressed by that legislation, \nnamely electronics, furniture, construction materials and \nproducts, and textiles.\n\nThe second part of this report examines the potential of waste \nprevention policies to address the growing quantities of textile \nwastes. Textile is a very suitable candidate for such policies, \nas it is a fast-growing waste stream, based on unsustainable \nconsumption patterns, driven by phenomena such as fast \nfashion. This suitability is increasingly being recognised by \nEU policymakers, as the textile industry is a key sector for \napplying circular economy measures, a key part of which is \nwaste\u00a0prevention.\n\nEach\tEuropean\tcitizen\tgenerates\taround\t11\u00a0kg\tof\ttextile\twaste\t\nannually. Of this quantity, around one third is separately \ncollected for reuse and recycling, suggesting that two thirds \nends up in residual waste or is stored in households. Several \ndrivers have been identified for the generation of textile waste, \nincluding the increasing number of clothing collections placed \n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n10 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\non the market by fashion brands, social media advertising fast \nfashion brands and digitalisation, which has helped fashion \nbrands to develop efficient supply chains and gain customers \nthrough online shopping.\n\nThe assessment of the policy background on textile waste \nprevention has highlighted various regulations that are directly \nor indirectly linked to textile waste generation, such as the \nTextile Regulation on textile fibre names and related labelling \nand marking of the fibre composition of textile products \n((EU)\tNo\u00a01007/2011),\tthe\tREACH\t(Registration,\tEvaluation,\t\nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation \n((EC)\u00a0No\u00a01907/2006)\tand\tthe\tEU\tgreen\tpublic\tprocurement\t\ncriteria for textile products and services. At the national level, \nvarious measures have been set out by Member States to \naddress textile waste. While 40 measures have been recorded \nin total across all programmes, some included specific \nsub-chapters dealing with textile waste generation and linked \nenvironmental impacts. Currently, only 6 out of 31 national \nand regional waste prevention programmes include specific \nindicators on textile waste prevention. The majority of these \nindicators focus on the reuse of clothing and footwear. When it \ncomes to targets, it has been shown that none of the currently \navailable waste prevention programmes include quantified \n\ntargets for textile waste prevention. This could be a major \ndrawback in waste prevention efforts, as solid targets are a \ndriver for comprehensive policies.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the intervention points for textile \nwaste prevention throughout products' life cycle stages; this \nhighlights the potential at each stage such as product design, \nproduction and distribution, use and maintenance, and reuse \nto contribute to waste prevention. Various potential measures \nare discussed, such as the extended producer responsibility \nschemes, which can encourage collection for reuse and improve \ndurability. A key barrier to the implementation of textile waste \nprevention measures, targets and indicators continues to be \nthat the actual quantity of textile waste generation remains \nwidely unknown. It is argued that increasing the collection rate \nwill make more textiles available for recycling and potentially \nalso for reuse. Although the textile value chain is highly \nglobalised and complex, closing communication gaps between \nstakeholders, implementing 'design for prevention' and \nincreasing transparency, i.e. traceability, would accelerate textile \nwaste prevention efforts. More specifically, strategies need to \nbe developed to address the increasing consumption of textiles, \nadvance their durability through improved design, and support \nrepair and reuse through economic instruments and regulation.\n\f\n11Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n1\nIntroduction\n\nWaste prevention is a key strategy for Europe's \ntransformation towards a resource-light and climate-neutral \ncircular economy. The long-established waste prevention \nhierarchy, as the optimal policy option for dealing with waste \ngeneration (Figure 1.1), offers the same type of systemic \nand transformational policy objective as the aspiration \nfor a circular economy. Waste prevention, by definition, \nlinks different life cycle stages of products together under \na common principle, namely that of waste reduction. In \nthis way, waste prevention provides a comprehensive \npolicy approach that links together stakeholders in the \nsupply chain, design and use of products and services, and \nwaste\u00a0management.\n\nWhen we look closer at the circular economy objectives of \nreducing the extraction of natural resources and keeping \nthe value of products as high as possible and for as long as \npossible, it is evident that waste prevention clearly contributes \nto this directly. Adopting key waste prevention strategies, such \nas design for durability and longevity, reuse of products and \nmaterials and the extension of product lifespans, ultimately \nleads to using fewer products, and therefore resources, to \nsatisfy our societal needs. Other waste prevention options, \nsuch as repair and remanufacturing, can safeguard the value \nof products and make sure that they are used until the actual \nend of their service life. Waste prevention strategies are \nconceptually summarised in Figure 1.2.\n\nProduct\n(non-waste)\n\nWaste\n\nPrevention\n\nPreparing for re-use\n\nRecycling\n\nRecovery\n\nDisposal\n\nFigure 1.1 The EU waste hierarchy\n\nSource: European Commission (2018).\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n12 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nThe importance of waste prevention, as outlined above, is \nrecognised not only in EU legislation, but also in the 2020 \ncircular economy action plan, which calls for specific waste \nprevention steps to be taken and for the consideration of \ndeveloping waste prevention targets for specific sectors and \nwaste streams.\n\nAccording to the definition set out in the revised Waste \nFramework Directive (WFD), waste prevention refers to:\n\nmeasures taken before a substance, material or product \nhas become waste, that reduce:\n\na. the quantity of waste, including through the reuse of \nproducts or the extension of the lifespan of products;\n\nb. the adverse impacts of the generated waste on the \nenvironment and human health; or\n\nc. the content of hazardous substances in materials and \nproducts. (EU, 2018).\n\nThe overall objective for implementing waste prevention \nis to 'break the link between economic growth and the \nenvironmental impacts associated with the generation of \nwaste' (EU, 2018). In order to implement waste prevention, in \naccordance with Article 29 of the WFD, Member States have \nto establish waste prevention programmes describing specific \nobjectives and measures.\n\nWaste prevention can be applied to separate waste streams (see \nBox 1.1) and the overall policies can be supported by tailor-made \nmeasures that address particular aspects of the waste stream \nin question. Textile waste is a prime candidate stream that \nwould benefit greatly from implementing waste prevention on \n\naccount of the high levels of consumption of textile products \nin Europe and its increasing waste generation. More broadly, \ntextiles is also a very relevant sector for EU policymaking. It has \nbeen recognised as a key sector in the circular economy action \nplan of 2020. Currently, the European Commission is working on \npreparing a textile strategy for the EU. Therefore, the thematic \npart of this report focuses on the prevention of textile waste, \nassessing the potential for prevention in this waste stream and \ngathering knowledge that will be potentially useful for the broad \npolicy processes currently in the making.\n\nThis report has a dual purpose. The first is to provide a \nsnapshot of the current implementation of waste prevention \nmeasures in Europe and assess the progress towards the main \noverall objective of waste prevention of decoupling waste \ngeneration from economic growth. The second aim of the \nreport is to investigate a specific waste stream and assess its \nprospects for implementing waste prevention. Therefore, this \nreport is divided into two parts:\n\n\u2022 Chapter 2 provides an overview of the progress towards \nimplementing waste prevention as a whole. It describes the \ncurrent policy framework and the status quo of national \nand regional waste prevention programmes, analyses the \nplanned and implemented waste prevention measures \nin these programmes and reviews progress towards \nwaste prevention based on waste intensities. A specific \nemphasis has been put on the development of new waste \nprevention-monitoring approaches for reuse and food \nwaste, in line with policy developments at the EU level.\n\n\u2022 Chapter 3 is thematic and focuses on the assessment of the \nimplementation of waste prevention for textile wastes and \ninvolves in-depth analyses of the potential for, barriers to \nand progress by each Member State and at the EU level.\n\nFigure 1.2 The R strategies for waste prevention and management\n\nProduct design\nand \nmanufacture\n\nExtended life spans\nand\nfunctionality\n\nR0 Refuse\n\nR1 Rethink\n\nR2 Reduce\n\nR3 Re-use\n\nR4 Repair\n\nR5 Refurbish\n\nR6 Remanufacture\n\nR7 Repurpose\n\nMake a product redundant: abandon function or use different product\n\nMake product use more intensive: sharing or multi-functional products\n\nConsume less through efficient manufacturing or use\n\nRe-use of functioning discarded products by another use\n\nRepair and maintenance of defects to deep original function\n\nRestore and update\n\nUse parts in a new product with the same function\n\nUse products or parts in a new product with a different function\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n13Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBox 1.1 Prevention of emerging waste streams\n\nThe energy transition to a clean energy system involves several technologies, essential for bringing about this transition \neffectively: wind power plants, photovoltaics and energy storage systems. It is expected that waste from the end-of-life \nstage of such technologies will increase exponentially in the coming years. \n\nWaste prevention can tackle these emerging waste streams by interventions in product design and maintenance (for more \ndetails,\tplease\tconsult\tthe\tEEA\tbriefing\ton\temerging\twaste\tstreams\u00a0(a)) and some European countries are already moving in \nthat direction:\n\n\u2022 In 2020, Enel Green, in Spain, launched a call for start-ups to develop solutions for the life extension, recyclability and \nremanufacturing of wind turbine components.\n\n\u2022 In the wind sector, some producers offer regular maintenance and repair of wind turbines in operation to increase \nthe durability and life span of wind power plants, and others are exploring targets for waste prevention using life \ncycle\u00a0assessment.\n\n\u2022 In Finland, France, Germany and some other European countries, enterprises have come to agreements with electric \ncar manufacturers to use batteries that have been decommissioned but still function in a second-life application as \nresidential battery packs for storing solar energy.\n\nNote: (a) https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emerging-waste-streams-opportunities-and\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emerging-waste-streams-opportunities-and\f\n\u00a9 Ergys Gezka, WasteSMART/EEA\n\f\n15Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2\nMonitoring progress in waste \nprevention implementation\n\n2.1 Decoupling waste generation from \neconomic growth\n\nArticle 30 of the revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) \nmandates the EEA to analyse the 'decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth and the transition towards a \ncircular economy' (EU, 2018). In the past, increases in economic \noutput have been accompanied by simultaneous increases in \nwaste generation, and so sustained economic growth brings a \ncontinual increase in waste generation. The transition towards \na circular economy in Europe, in which the value of products \nand raw materials contained in those are preserved for as \nlong as possible, aims to break this link and minimise overall \nwaste generation. Successful waste prevention aims to increase \nwell-being and reduce waste generation and the corresponding \nenvironmental impacts.\n\nThere are three types of decoupling:\n\n1. absolute decoupling, when waste generation is decreasing, \nwhile the economy is growing;\n\n2. relative decoupling, when waste generation is increasing, \nbut at a slower pace than economic growth;\n\n3. no decoupling, when waste generation is increasing at the \nsame pace as or faster than the economy.\n\nInterpreting these types of decoupling and linking them to \nwaste prevention measures is difficult, as other socio-economic \nfactors also influence the level of waste generated. First of all, \nregarding the influence of economic factors, waste generation \ndepends more on specific expenditure types and the share of \nexpenditure types by income than on broad, economy-wide \neconomic developments, in particular when examining specific \nwaste streams. Other social factors that affect waste generation \nare demography (especially population growth) and household \nsize. Underlying this is the cultural variety of Europe, which \nencompasses a range of lifestyle habits across all areas, \nincluding consumption and waste management.\n\nThis complexity of factors affecting waste generation \nis significant when trying to interpret trends. When it is \nimpossible to establish causal links between waste prevention \nmeasures and waste generation trends, it is difficult to draw \nconclusions on decoupling, as the decoupling stability might be \ncompromised by other socio-economic factors. For example, \nduring the dip in waste generation during the financial crisis of \n2008-2010 did not lead to decoupling because it was a result \nof an economic downturn, not the effect of waste policy making.\n\n2.1.1 EU level\n\nFigure 2.1 shows that waste generation in the EU has been \nincreasing constantly since 2008. Between 2008 and 2018, total \nwaste\tgeneration\tincreased\tby\t8.5\u00a0%\t(more\tthan\t182\u00a0million\u00a0tonnes).\t\nMajor mineral wastes, such as hard rocks, concrete and soils, \ncomprise a major share of total waste. However, this type of waste \nis produced in specific economic sectors (construction and mining) \nand the management of this type of waste poses a relatively \nlow environmental concern compared with other waste types. \nTherefore, to be able to interpret trends in a more meaningful \nway, Figure 2.1 includes a trend for waste excluding major mineral \nwastes.\tThis\tshows\ta\tlower\tincrease\tof\t6.4\u00a0%\tover\tthe\tsame\tperiod.\t\nFor both waste generation types, there is a sharper increase in the \nlast data point (2018). However, it should be noted that measuring \ntotal waste is a complex task, with data collection and data quality \nissues encountered.\n\nGenerally, a population increase could, of course, explain an \nincrease in absolute amounts of waste generated. However, \nthe EU-27 population was relatively stable between 2008 and \n2018, so the reasons for the increase in waste generation \ncannot be attributed to demography. The EU's gross domestic \nproduct (GDP)\u00a0(1) in the same period of time increased by \n20.4\u00a0%,\tat\ta\tmuch\tfaster\tpace\tthan\tthe\twaste\tgenerated.\tThis\t\nmeans that the EU as a whole has achieved relative decoupling, \nbut has not yet achieved waste prevention measures' main \nobjective of actually reducing the waste generated while the \neconomy\u00a0grows.\n\n(1) GDP here includes the contribution of mining and also demolition that result in the waste excluded from the graph in Figure 2.1. Although this \nlimitation is acknowledged, the contribution to GDP from these activities is very small.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n16 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBy 2013, most EU Member States put in place their waste \nprevention programmes in line with the mandate from the 2008 \nWFD. Looking at the waste generation trends in Figure 2.1, there \nis no observable impact of the adoption of the programmes \nat EU level. In fact, waste generation, excluding major mineral \nwastes,\tincreased\tby\t5.2\u00a0%\tbetween\t2014\tand\t2018.\n\nWaste intensity expresses waste generation per unit of GDP, \nreflecting the economy's 'eco-efficiency' in terms of the \nlevels of waste generated (Eurostat, 2020a). This term and \nsubsequent indicator is part of Eurostat's circular economy \nmonitoring framework. Waste intensity also reflects the \nstructure of the economy, as a services-based economy \nis less waste intensive than an industry-based economy. \nHowever, given that the structure of the economy changes \nat a relatively slow rate, changes in waste intensity are likely \nto indicate trends towards decoupling. For the EU-27, the \nwaste intensity (for total waste, excluding major mineral \nwaste), decreased from approximately 68\u00a0kg/EUR\u00a01\u00a0000\tGDP\t\nin\t2008\tto\taround\u00a060\u00a0kg/EUR\u00a01\u00a0000\tGDP\tin\t2018,\twhich\tis\t\na significant improvement, in spite of the EU not achieving \n\nFigure 2.1 Waste generation development compared with gross domestic product (GDP) and population in \nthe EU-27\n\nPercentage\n\n0\n\n2008 20102009 20142012 2016 2018\n\n125\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n2011 2013 2015 2017\n\nTotal waste generation\n\nGross Domestic Product\n(GDP)\n\nPopulation\n\nTotal waste excluding\nmajor mineral wastes\n\nabsolute decoupling. The 2016-2018 change led to the largest \ndrop in waste intensity, because although waste generation \nincreased at a faster pace than before, the acceleration of the \neconomy was even faster. This demonstrates the usefulness \nof waste intensity as a metric for monitoring progress towards \ndecoupling waste generation from economic growth.\n\nThese changes in waste intensity are the combined effect \nof various developments that either increase or decrease \nwaste generation, specifically continuous economic growth \n(a key driver of waste generation) and at the same time the \nimproved efficiency of production processes (as highlighted \nby\tEurostat\tindicators\ton\tresource\tproductivity)\u00a0(2). It is not \npossible, however, to quantify the effect of waste prevention \nmeasures that have been implemented by the EU countries \nduring this period, as the effect of prevention measures can \nrarely be assessed quantitatively and unilaterally against \nwaste generation. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the \npossibility that the emphasis given to waste prevention in the \n2008 WFD may have resulted in, for example, improvements in \nwaste intensity.\n\n(2) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Resource_productivity_statistics\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Resource_productivity_statistics\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n17Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTo highlight the relevance of these contributing factors, a \ndecomposition analysis was conducted to assess the effect \nof certain driving forces on waste generation (Hoekstra and \nvan der Bergh, 2006), decomposing the change in a macro \nindicator (waste generation) between two points in time into \nthe contributions from the changes in the determinants (in this \ncase, economic growth and waste intensity).\n\nFigure 2.2 shows the result of this analysis: the change in waste \ngenerated per capita over time (taking 2008 as the reference \nyear) is depicted as the combined effect of increased GDP and \ndecreased waste intensity. An increase in GDP alone would lead \nto an increase in waste generation and a decrease in waste \nintensity would lead to a decrease in waste generation. The figure \nshows the net effect of these two developments combined.\n\nThe orange line indicates that waste generation per capita \ndecreased slightly in 2010 and 2012, mainly because of \nthe economic crisis; Between 2010 and 2012 the effect \nof the increase in GDP on economic growth (in blue) was \novercompensated for by decreased waste intensity (grey bars). \nThe struggling economy grew so slowly that technological and \norganisational improvements were able to reduce the total \ngeneration of waste in Europe. Since 2014 the relation between \nthe two effects has been reversed, leading to a significant \nincrease in waste generation per capita of almost 100\u00a0kg. \n\nThe pace of economic growth based on increasing turnover \nin industry and increased consumption expenditure by \nhouseholds has outrun efforts to reduce waste generation per \neuro of value created.\n\nThe analysis highlights that an actual and significant decoupling \nof waste generation and economic growth has not been \nachieved over the last decade. The total generation of waste is \nstill closely linked to GDP growth rates. The analysis of waste \nprevention programmes and other activities aimed at avoiding \nwaste generation (see following sections in this chapter) has \nshown a slight increase in the stringency of such measures \n(e.g. showing a higher share of regulatory measures compared \nwith\tjust\tinformative\tmeasures,\tsuch\tas\tawareness\u00a0raising\t\ncampaigns); nevertheless, this is not yet reflected in the \nactual outcomes that still indicate rather linear patterns of \nproduction and consumption. A more detailed analysis of the \navailable data shows a very close relation between decreasing \nwaste intensities and a rising share of the service sector in the \nEU-27. New business models based on 'pay per use' seem to \ncontribute to waste prevention, but of course the rising share \nof\tthe\ttertiary\tsector\t\u2014\tfrom\t33.9\u00a0%\tto\t39\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU-27\tGDP\t\nbetween 2008 and 2018 \u2014 also reduced the share of especially \nwaste-intensive production processes in Europe. Further \nanalysis should focus on the extent to which such processes \nhave just been outsourced to other regions.\n\nFigure 2.2 Decomposition analysis of waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes)\n\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n-14\n\nPercentage\n\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\nWaste generation, excluding major mineral wasteWaste intensityGross Domestic Product (GDP)\n\n-0.32-0.24\n1.12\n\n3.18\n\n6.90\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n18 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.1.2 Country level\n\nMap 2.1 illustrates the evolution of waste intensity as the \ngeneration of waste (excluding major mineral waste) per unit \nGDP from 2008 to 2018. Positive values in Map 2.1 indicate that \nthe increase of waste generation has exceeded the economic \ngrowth (in terms of GDP) within that period, whereas negative \nvalues indicate a successful relative or absolute decoupling of \nwaste generation from economic growth. Map 2.1 also shows the \npopulation change in the same period (2008-2018) and the level \nof waste generation in 2018. In most cases, the population change \n\nis not large enough to explain sufficiently the changes in the \nwaste intensity. In some countries with positive developments in \nwaste intensity (negative values in Map 2.1), population increased, \nsuch is the case in Austria, Finland, Iceland, Turkey and Sweden. \nIn countries that were also successful in decoupling the waste \ngeneration from economic growth, such as Romania, Lithuania \nand Hungary, the population did decrease, but this alone cannot \njustify the changes in waste intensity. On the other hand, Latvia is \nthe only country where the population decrease was higher than \nthe reduction in waste intensity, meaning that the improvement in \nLatvia can be explained by the population change.

To account for factors influencing waste intensity, other \nthan waste prevention measures, a deeper investigation of the \neconomic structure of the countries would be needed, but that \nexercise is outside the scope of this report. Note that changes \nin data collection systems, data quality, waste classification and \ndefinitions might have played a role in the data in Map 2.1.\n\nDespite the acknowledged complexity of assessing waste \ngeneration trends against economic developments, the \nmain objective of the EU waste prevention policy, namely \nthe absolute decoupling of waste generation from economic \ngrowth, has not been achieved yet. However, the fact that many \nEU Member States, and the EU as a whole, show a relative \ndecoupling during the period 2008-2018 is an encouraging sign \nfor future developments.\n\n2.2 Overview of national and regional waste \nprevention programmes\n\nThe WFD required that Member States established waste \nprevention programmes no later than December 2013. The \nwaste prevention programmes have been operating since then. \nThe following Table 2.1 provides an overview of the current \nstatus and duration of the different regional and national waste \nprevention programmes. Based on the provisions in the WFD, \nsome were developed as stand-alone programmes, whereas in \nsome other countries the programmes have been included in \nwaste management plans or strategies.\n\nIt can be observed that there is an increasing trend for countries \nto integrate waste prevention programmes in national waste \nmanagement plans or other policy documents, such as their \ncircular economy laws or strategies, as is the case in France, for \nexample. One reason for this trend is that such an integration \nwith waste management plans aligns the implementation \nperiod of a country's main strategic waste policy documents. \nThis, however, might lead to gaps if a country is not covered by \na waste prevention programme for a certain period.\n\nTable 2.1 shows that 10 out of the 32 countries are not covered \nby a waste prevention programme in 2021. According to the \nWFD, waste prevention programmes have to be evaluated and \nrevised at least every 6 years and, where relevant, in the event \n\nof a legislative change in the WFD (see Article 30(1)). Given that \nall Member States had to have their first waste prevention \nprogrammes published in 2013, various Member States had \nplanned to have a new waste prevention programme in place \nin 2019, 6 years after their first one. However, the amendment \nof the WFD in 2018 introduced a new approach to waste \nprevention and new requirements for EU Member States. \nTherefore, a number of EU countries are in the process of \nreconsidering their national waste strategies, including waste \nprevention. This report takes into account newly ratified waste \nprevention programmes where available, but it should also be \nacknowledged that the effect of the amended WFD is not yet \nreflected in all countries' waste prevention programmes.\n\nReflecting on the impact of adopting waste prevention \nprogrammes on waste generation, no observable trends can \nbe seen. Figure 2.1 shows that waste generation has been \nunaffected by the wide adoption of such programmes by \nEuropean countries in 2013. Moreover, looking at individual \ncountries in the EEA waste prevention country profiles\u00a0(3), \nthe adoption of a waste prevention programme is very rarely \ncorrelated with a drop in waste generation afterwards.\n\nBox 2.1 Example of the evaluation process \nin\u00a0Germany\n\nThe German federal government adopted its first \nwaste prevention programme in July 2013 under the \ntitle 'Waste prevention programme of the German \ngovernment with the involvement of the federal states' \n('Abfallvermeidungsprogramm des Bundes unter Beteiligung \nder L\u00e4nder'). The German waste prevention programme is \nto be evaluated every 6 years and updated as necessary \nas per Section 33 of Germany's waste prevention \nmechanism, the Circular Economy Act (KrWG). Against \nthis background, the German environmental protection \nagency (Umweltbundesamt) initiated a research project to \nevaluate the status quo of waste prevention in Germany. \nThis included an assessment of waste prevention results \nand the institutional structures. Other aspects not \npreviously addressed in the waste prevention programme \nwere also to be examined to see whether or not they \ncontribute to waste prevention. Specific proposals to \npossibly develop and update the programme were \ndeveloped based on the results of the analysis referring \nto the current status of the implementation of the waste \nprevention programme at the federal, state and municipal \nlevels and the evaluation of existing prevention potentials. \nConcrete proposals for measures concerning previously \nprioritised waste streams and relevant priority prevention \napproaches were developed to facilitate this.\n\nSources: UBA (2020).\n\n(3) https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries/norway-waste-prevention-fact-sheet/view\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n20 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nThe analysis presented in this report is based on the national \nwaste prevention programmes presented in Table 2.1.

Additionally, there is a \nspecial focus on the prevention of food waste.\n\nThe national waste prevention programmes include measures \nand targets for the specific waste streams in focus accordingly. \nEach country's selection of waste stream, however, is also \nrelated to factors such as waste volumes generated or economic \nimportance (EEA, 2021), which may differ in different national \nsettings. An overview of the waste streams considered in the \nnational waste prevention programmes is outlined in Table 2.2.\n\nTable 2.2 Waste streams considered in EEA member countries and regions\n\nEEA member \ncountries\n\nFood/\norganic \nwaste (30)\n\nPlastic/\npackaging \nwaste (30)\n\nTextile (16) Manufacturing \nwaste (29) WEEE (29)\n\nHousehold/\nmunicipal \nwaste (28)\n\nHazardous \nwaste (27)\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\u00a0(a)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nNote: (a) Note that the regional plan, as part of the Wallonia regional programme, does not cover textile and manufacturing waste.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n22 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBased on this overview, it can be stated that most countries \nhave almost all types of waste materials covered:\n\n\u2022 Hazardous waste, which is considered in almost all \ncountries, is often addressed in specific strategies, e.g. in \nthe Irish national hazardous waste management plan.\n\n\u2022 Plastic, i.e. packaging waste, and food waste are focus \npoints in all programmes that are covered by various types \nof measures.\n\n\u2022 Textile waste, which has gained in importance as a waste \nstream, is considered in 16 programmes. Countries such \nas Belgium, Germany and Slovakia have included textile \nwaste in their revised waste prevention programmes, \nwhereas there had been no consideration of textile waste \nin their former programmes.\n\nWith respect to the recommendations of the revised WFD, \ncountries already seem to have been considering WEEE, \npackaging, manufacturing and hazardous waste. Furniture is \nnot yet broadly addressed as a standalone waste stream, but \nin some cases it is included in household waste prevention \nmeasures. Textile waste is not yet a focus in most countries, \nbut the recent policy focus at the EU level (e.g. the forthcoming \ntextile strategy) is expected to make textiles more prominently \npart of the next versions of waste prevention programmes.\n\nOverall, it can be seen that the revision of waste prevention \nprogrammes is accompanied by an extension of the waste \nstreams considered. Slovakia, for instance, includes the waste \nstreams textiles and WEEE, which are additions in comparison \nto its former programme.\n\nThis overview also serves as a reflection of the countries' policy \npriorities. The fact that plastic and food waste are considered \nthroughout all programmes can, for instance, be traced \nback to policy initiatives at the EU level; waste prevention \nprogrammes serve as a policy vehicle to address certain \nrequirements. These two streams have long been recognised \nas having a significant potential for prevention, while the \nprevention of food waste is specifically included in the UN \nSustainable Development Goals.\n\n2.4 Indicators\n\nThe application of indicators is crucial to monitoring and \nassessing the waste prevention measures set in place. \nGiven that the amendments in the WFD reorient the policy \nfocus from the development of prevention strategies and \nprogrammes towards the implementation of prevention and \nits monitoring, indicators become essential elements for future \nprevention policies. Indicators ensure not only the monitoring \nof developments but also the evaluation of their effectiveness.\n\nThe waste Prevention indicators can thereby be manyfold, \ncategorised into four types: (1) output-based indicators, \n(2)\u00a0decoupling\tindicators,\t(3)\tresponse\tindicators\tand\t(4)\t\nindicators of specific waste prevention measures. While \noutput-based indicators monitor the success of waste \nprevention measures in absolute numbers or percentages, \ndecoupling indicators consider them in relation to economic \nvalues such as GDP. Response indicators relate to the process \nof waste prevention (such as number of measures) and, finally, \nindicators are grouped into specific waste prevention measures \nthat do not relate to the aggregated effects of the programme \nbut to specific prevention measures (such as cost-benefit). An \noverview of indicator types considered in the waste prevention \nprogrammes of the countries examined is provided in Table 2.3.\n\nIt can be seen that output-based indicators are covered in \nmost of the programmes. These mostly refer to the generation \nof total or specific waste streams or to material flows such as \nhousehold or municipal waste or construction and demolition \nwaste (tonnes/year). Reuse rates are also considered; for \nexample, Poland considers the percentage of packaging placed \non the market that is reusable.\n\nDecoupling indicators, which illustrate a nation's waste \nintensity or the waste intensity of a specific sector, are \nimplemented in 11 out of 30 programmes. They are commonly \nexpressed per unit of GDP (and per population) or gross value \nadded (GVA). An example is Slovakia, where the indicator \nquantity of total municipal waste per unit of GDP and \npopulation is used.\n\nResponse indicators can cover a wide range of indicators. \nDenmark, for example, considers the number of enterprises \nwith certified environmental management, the number of \neco-labelled products and the degree of public awareness of \nthem. Italy uses response indicators throughout various waste \nstreams, such as the number of guidelines related to food \nindustry by-products or the number of ethical procurement \ngroups created.\n\nIndicators linked to specific waste prevention measures \n(e.g.\u00a0banning\tspecific\tsingle-use\tplastic\tproducts)\tare\tincluded\t\nin nine programmes. Ireland, for instance, considers the money \nsaved by comparing the costs of waste before and after the \nintervention. The region Flanders, on the other hand, considers \nthe amount and cost of littering and illegal dumping and the \nnumber of rubbish bins.\n\nOverall, it can be stated that indicators are relatively sparsely \nused throughout the countries, with output-based indicators \nbeing the most common type of indicator used. While some \nprogrammes involve indicators that cover up to three types of \nindicator, other programmes have not included any indicator. \nThis can be the case for countries that predominantly define \nqualitative waste prevention targets, e.g. Norway.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n23Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTable 2.3 Waste prevention indicators considered in EEA countries and regions\n\nEEA member \ncountries\n\nOutput-based \nindicators (22)\n\nDecoupling \nindicators\u00a0(11)\n\nResponse \nindicators\u00a0(18)\n\nSpecific waste prevention \nindicators (9)\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\u00a0(a)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nNote: The\tprogramme\tfor\tthe\tBrussels\tregion\tcontains\tno\tindicators,\twhile\tthe\tFlemish\tone\tincludes\tonly\tspecific\tindicators.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n24 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.5 Targets\n\nTarget setting is the cornerstone of policymaking in the area \nof waste prevention. Targets set the stage and calibrate the \nambition of the overall waste prevention strategy and for \nspecific waste streams if needed. Targets can drive the policy \nprocess, as they require:\n\n\u2022 developing indicators for monitoring progress towards \nthe\u00a0target;\n\n\u2022 indicating data requirements to measure progress;\n\n\u2022 designing measures that would bring about the change \ncommanded by the target; \n\n\u2022 evaluating the effectiveness of the entire waste prevention \nprogramme at the end of its implementation.\n\nThe type of targets defined in the waste prevention \nprogrammes can be qualitative or quantitative. An overview of \ntarget types set throughout the Member States is outlined in \nTable 2.4.\n\nA quantitative target is usually concrete and measurable. \nThat is why it serves as a strong driver for waste prevention \nimplementation. A successful implementation is, however, \ndependent on the availability of timely and robust data sets, \nwhich can be a limitation. Quantitative targets are included in \n22 out of the 30 programmes reviewed. However, they mostly \nrefer to one or two waste streams that are in focus in that \ncountry. Croatia and Estonia, for instance, have one central \ntarget on municipal waste prevention, whereas Austria's and \nFinland's quantitative target is to halve food waste by 2030.\n\nWhen carefully planned, qualitative targets can provide \nevidence of successful actions. A few countries (e.g. Austria, \nIceland, Norway and Slovenia) have identified qualitative targets \nonly, while in most countries qualitative and quantitative \ntargets exist. The qualitative targets defined within the waste \nprevention programmes are manifold but mainly refer to \ncentral waste streams (e.g. electronics, construction, municipal \nwaste and hazardous waste). Slovenia and Iceland, for instance, \nhave several measures in place that focus explicitly on \nhazardous waste prevention.\n\nAn ideal situation for national programmes is to use both types \nof targets in a blended approach. This is being done by a lot of \ncountries. Particularly with regard to the updated programmes, \nthe tendency is that quantitative targets have been put in place \n\nwhere solely qualitative targets were considered before. This \nhas been the case in Germany and Slovakia, and although \nCyprus did not have any defined targets, the new programme \nincludes both qualitative and quantitative targets. This \ndevelopment indicates countries making stronger commitments \nto waste prevention and is expected to bear measurable results \nin the coming years.\n\nThis leaves only two countries with no waste prevention \ntargets: Hungary and Switzerland. Following the trend of \nother countries, however, targets might be set with their \nupdated\u00a0programmes.\n\nThe introduction of common waste prevention targets at the EU \nlevel would help harmonise efforts in countries and promote \nthe development of solid policies around them. The efforts to \nachieve the targets would lead to measure being developed \nto support this, determine the waste streams to focus on and \nimprove the monitoring of progress towards the set targets.\n\nBox 2.2 Quantitative waste prevention targets in \nFrance\n\nIn 2020, France introduced a law on the circular \neconomy and the fight against waste. This legislation \nintroduces a large number of quantitative targets \ncovering overall waste generation and also particular \nwaste streams, such as plastic and food waste. These \nlegally binding targets include:\n\n\u2022 reducing\thousehold\twaste\tby\t15\u00a0%;\n\n\u2022 reducing the quantities of non-hazardous waste \nadmitted\tto\tstorage\tfacilities\tby\t30\u00a0%\tin\t2020,\t\nrelative\tto\t2010,\tand\tby\t50\u00a0%\tin\t2025;\n\n\u2022 recycling\t100\u00a0%\tof\tplastic\tby\t2025,\tdriven\tand\t\nensured by the national waste prevention and \nmanagement policy through measures such as \nimproved\twaste\tcollection\u00a0programmes;\n\n\u2022 reducing the number of single-use plastic beverage \nbottles\tplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\tby\t50\u00a0%\tby\t2030\t\n(Article 66);\n\n\u2022 halving food waste in distribution and collective \ncatering by 2025 and food waste in consumption, \nproduction, processing and commercial catering by \n2030, relative to 2015 (Article 11).\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n25Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTable 2.4 Waste prevention targets considered in EEA countries and regions\n\nEEA member countries Quantitative targets (22) Qualitative targets (23) No targets (2)\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\u00a0(a)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nNote: The Brussels regional programme does not have quantitative targets.\n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n26 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.6 Waste prevention measures\n\nThe WFD obliges the Member States to indicate specific \nmeasures by which the amount of waste and related \nenvironmental impacts are to be reduced.\n\nThe analysis of the national and regional waste prevention \nprogrammes highlights the broad range of measures already \ntaken or under development in Europe. A total of 327 specific \nmeasures have been recorded, which cover measures initiated \nor undertaken by public authorities only \u2014 most countries and \nregions focus on similar sets of measures. This figure does not \ninclude the probably far bigger number of private initiatives by \nhouseholds or companies, e.g. professional online platforms \nthat offer second-hand products.\n\nIt is important to note that this chapter considers national \ninitiatives. However, countries have the opportunity to \ncollaborate on or exchange best practices regarding waste \nprevention measures in international settings. At the EU \nlevel, a good example of a platform for such exchanges is the \nEuropean\tWeek\tfor\tWaste\tReduction\u00a0(4), during which more \nthan\t10\u00a0000\twaste\tprevention\tactions\twere\tlogged\tin\t2020\t\nfrom 33 European countries. Other collaborative opportunities \nare offered through country networks such as the European \nCommission's waste working group and the EEA's Eionet. Good \npractice examples are systematically registered in the EEA's \ncountry\tprofiles\u00a0(5) for inspiration and, specifically for food \nwaste prevention, at the newly launched EU Food Loss and \nWaste\tPrevention\tHub\u00a0(6).\n\n2.6.1 Share of policy instruments\n\nThe waste prevention programmes cover a variety of policy \ninstruments that can be grouped into the following four main \ntypes: (1) voluntary agreements, (2) regulatory instruments, \n(3)\u00a0economic\tinstruments\tand\t(4)\tinformation\tinstruments.\n\n1. Voluntary agreements refer to agreements among various \nstakeholders. They do not necessarily require a political \ndecision-making process but rather require negotiations. \nIn 2016, for instance, the Italian National Agency for \nNew Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic \n\nDevelopment (ENEA) launched a Symbiosis Users Network \nto enable industrial symbiosis in Italy. The network focuses \non operational symbiosis issues to prevent waste and \npromote circular economy models.\n\n2. Most waste prevention programmes include some \nregulatory instruments. Romania, for instance, launched \na ban on landfilling food waste from wholesale, retail and \ndistribution sectors from January 2023 onwards \u2014 forcing \nthese stakeholders to explore prevention potentials more \nthoroughly. By contrast, in Austria single-use plastic bags \nhave been banned since January 2020, following the rapid \nimplementation of the EU Single-use Plastics Directive.\n\n3. Economic instruments aim to set economic incentives for \nchanges in consumption or production patterns by making \nless waste-intensive alternatives more attractive. This type \nof instrument involves tax regulations (e.g. Bulgaria and \nSweden),\tthe\tintroduction\tof\tfees\tfor\tplastic\tbags\t(e.g.\u00a0most\t\nEU Member States) and other waste management \noperations so that 'waste-light' products or services become \nmore competitive. The financial support for specific waste \nprevention measures can be counted as an economic \ninstrument as well as an economic incentive for making \nsustainable purchases (e.g. Portugal).\n\n4. Information instruments relate to campaigns for \nconsumers or businesses. Romania, for instance, conducts \nawareness-raising campaigns on composting, the reduction \nof food waste and responsible paper consumption. \nThe Netherlands, on the other hand, states that it will \nimplement an eco-design knowledge platform enabling \nbusinesses to access knowledge on a permanent basis. The \nunderlying assumption is that better access to information \nwill change consumer habits or nudge companies towards \ntaking up cost-saving opportunities.\n\nFigure 2.3 illustrates that more than half of the measures \nincluded in countries' waste prevention programmes focus \non the provision of information and awareness-raising. Of the \nmeasures\tlisted\tin\tthe\twaste\tprevention\tprogrammes,\t6\u00a0%\tcan\t\nbe\tclassified\tas\tregulatory\tinstruments\tand\t18\u00a0%\tas\teconomic\t\nor market-based instruments.

A relevant number also refers to \nthe waste management sector aiming to set indirect incentives, \nfor instance by increasing landfill taxes for municipal solid \nwaste (here counted as measures that primarily address \nconsumption\u00a0patterns).\n\nIt is important to note that there are rare examples when a \nsingle measure of a specific type has resulted in effective waste \nprevention (e.g. the fees on plastic carrier bags). Usually, it \nis a combination of different types of measures that is most \neffective for implementing prevention measures. Therefore, it \nwould be useful for countries to diversify their waste prevention \nmeasures portfolio and link that to concrete prevention targets.\n\nOn the other hand, this complexity and overlapping of \nmeasures targeting waste prevention makes it difficult to assess \nindividual measures' effectiveness. Some countries make use \nof various proxy indicators to assess effectiveness (e.g. number \nof awareness-raising events taking place), but only in very rare \ncases is it possible to measure the effect on waste generation \n(e.g. levy on plastic carrier bags). For more details on evaluation, \nsee the EEA guideline on evaluating waste prevention \nprogrammes (EEA, 2021).\n\nInterestingly, only a very few waste prevention programmes \ninclude specific measures aimed at cross-country cooperation \non waste prevention, e.g. the Nordic Swan ecolabel, aimed at, \namong other things, waste-light products.\n\n2.6.1 Trends in policy approaches\n\nComparing the mapping above with the EEA's waste prevention \nreport, published in 2016, which gave the first general \noverview on implementation approaches for waste prevention \nprogrammes (EEA, 2016), some trends can be highlighted. The \nshare of information-based instruments that completely depend \non\tvoluntary\tactions\tby\tall\tstakeholders\thas\tdecreased\t(-12\u00a0%),\t\nwhile the share of more stringent measures has increased \n(+10\u00a0%),\tincluding\tboth\teconomic\tand\tregulatory\tinstruments.\n\nIt thes mainly plastic and packaging waste that has been \naddressed by such binding instruments. It seems that \nthe intensive policy discourse and the high level of public \nawareness of the global problems \u2014caused especially by \nplastic waste leaked into marine ecosystems \u2014 have led to the \nperception that voluntary actions alone will not be sufficient. A \nlarge share of these measures also refers to the EU Single-use \nPlastic Directive, which, inter alia, banned plastic straws and \nintroduced levies on plastic bags (see EEA, 2019). A second \nwaste stream that is increasingly addressed by market-based \nor regulatory instruments is food losses. Many countries have \nadopted national commitments to Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 12.3, which demands halving of food losses by 2030.\n\nAt the same time, the number of newly initiated voluntary \nagreements has decreased slightly. It should be noted that this \ndoes not necessarily indicate an overall decrease in this policy \ninstrument's relevance; many voluntary agreements are still in \nplace and have proven to be effective, such as the Green Deals \nin the Netherlands (Green Deal, undated).\n\nThe total number of measures and their relative shares give only \na first indication of the level of ambition, i.e. the relevance of \nspecific policy instruments; the numbers, of course, cannot reflect \nthe impact of a single measure that might differ significantly, \nfor example between a regional awareness campaign and a \ncomprehensive green public procurement programme.\n\nWith regard to specific waste streams addressed by public \nwaste prevention measures, it can be observed that plastic \npackaging waste, food waste and WEEE have especially gained \nin importance. Qualitative prevention, defined as actions \naimed at the phasing out of hazardous substances, is still of \nlimited relevance. None of the waste prevention programmes \ninclude quantified objectives on qualitative waste prevention, \nmethodological approaches and databases that would allow \nmonitoring of progress in this area.\n\nFigure 2.3 Share of policy instruments\n\nInformative\n54 %\n\nVoluntary \nagreements\n\n22 %\n\nMarket-based\n18 %\n\nRegulatory\n6 %\n\nNotes: (a) Note that some countries are in the process of revising \ntheir\twaste\tprevention\tpolicies,\tso\tthis\tfigure\tis\tbased\ton\t\ncontinuously evolving information.\n\nSource: Own calculation based on the EEA country fact sheets on \nwaste\tprevention\u00a0(a).\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-prevention/countries/belgium/view\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n28 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2.7 New waste prevention focus areas\n\nThe 2018 amendment of the WFD included new focus areas \nfor waste prevention, with policy initiatives and data collection \nrequirements envisaged at the EU level. These two main focus \nareas are food waste prevention and the promotion of reuse. \nNote that, according to the WFD, the EU Member States have \nto develop separate, although not necessarily standalone, food \nwaste prevention programmes. The information presented \nbelow is derived exclusively from such programmes.\n\n2.7.1 Food waste\n\nApproximately\t20\u00a0%\t(88\tmillion\ttonnes)\u00a0(7) of all produced \nfood within the EU is wasted along the supply chain every \nyear (Stenmarck et al., 2016). Consequently, food waste \nprevention has become one of the key priorities in most \nwaste\u00a0prevention\u00a0programmes.\n\nReducing food waste has enormous potential for reducing the \nresources we use and the pollutants we emit to produce the \nfood we eat. Acting more efficiently will increase the amount of \nfood available for human consumption, save money and lower \nthe wide-ranging environmental impacts of food production \nand\tconsumption\u00a0(8). The EU and the individual countries aspire \nto\tachieving\tthe\ttarget\tin\tSDG\u00a012.3\tto\thalve\tfood\twaste\tper\t\ncapita at the retail and consumer level by 2030 and to reduce \nfood losses along the food production and supply chains. The \nEU\tPlatform\ton\tFood\tLosses\tand\tFood\tWaste\u00a0(9), established \nin 2016, which stimulates stakeholder engagement and \nknowledge exchange, supports this process.\n\nAs called for by the new farm to fork strategy, the Commission \nwill seek to step up action to prevent food loss and waste across \nthe EU. The strategy, part of the European Green Deal, puts \nforward a series of actions to accelerate the transition towards \na sustainable EU food system that safeguards food security \nand ensures access to healthy diets sourced from a healthy \nplanet. Reducing food loss and waste is an integral part of the \nstrategy's action plan, which proposes to establish EU-wide food \nwaste reduction targets by 2023 and revise EU date marking \nrules to prevent food waste linked to the misunderstanding \nand/or misuse of these dates (by end 2022).\n\nThe recently published EEA report on bio-waste emphasised \nonce\tmore\tthe\trole\tof\tfood\twaste\tby\tindicating\tthat\t60\u00a0%\t\nof bio-waste is food waste, of which a considerable share is \navoidable (EEA, 2020). However, a reliable data baseline for \nquantifying the exact amount of food waste, i.e. for monitoring \nthe progress on prevention, still needs to be established.\n\nMeasures on food waste prevention are included in 28 of \nthe 32 national and regional waste prevention programmes. \nThe countries and regions have introduced an array of \npolicies and measures, including:\n\n\u2022 prioritisation of actions against food waste, for better \nefficiency throughout the whole food chain (e.g. Austria, \nFrance, Netherlands, Spain);\n\n\u2022 integration of the waste prevention hierarchy in their \nmanagement plans or other legislation (e.g. Czechia, \nFrance, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia);\n\n\u2022 dealing with surplus food across the food supply chain, \nincluding through the creation of digital redistribution \nplatforms (e.g. Croatia, Denmark,  \nFinland, Netherlands);\n\n\u2022 legislation that obliges supermarkets to donate \nunsaleable but edible food to social institutions or \nto use it alternatively as animal feed or as compost \n(e.g.\u00a0France,\u00a0Italy);\n\n\u2022 donation of pre-packaged food labelled 'Best before ...' \nwithin the timeframe set in the recommendations  \n(e.g. Lithuania);\n\n\u2022 encouragement of food donations by fiscal incentives \nthrough tax credits and tax deductions (e.g. France, \nPortugal, Spain);\n\n\u2022 voluntary agreements in the food sector with the aim \nof reducing food waste (e.g. Spain under the slogan \n'Food\u00a0has\tno\twaste\t\u2014\tUse\tit');\n\n\u2022 obligation to register as a food business operator for all \ncharity organisations (that handle the food), including \nfulfilling requirements for liability, traceability and \nhygiene (e.g. Lithuania, Romania);\n\n\u2022 guidelines for the prevention of food waste in the \ncatering sector (e.g. Germany, Spain);\n\n\u2022 implementation of action plans to reduce food waste \n(e.g. Austria, Sweden);\n\n\u2022 provision of funds for research and innovation activities \nthat help reduce food waste (e.g. Germany);\n\n\u2022 educational activities in schools and/or professional \ntraining (e.g. Croatia, Czechia, Finland, Hungary, Italy);\n\n(7) This excludes food by-products used as animal feed.\n(8) https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu_actions_en\n(9) https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food-waste/eu-actions-against-food-waste/eu-platform-food-losses-and-food-waste_en \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu_actions_en\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n29Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n\u2022 awareness-raising and behaviour change campaigns \nfor consumers (e.g. Germany's 'Too good for the bin!'; \nLatvia's 'Discarded is not gone'; Lithuania's 'Sincerely, \nfood'; Spain's 'More food, less waste'), including dedicated \nevents\t(e.g.\u00a0Danish\t'National\tFood\tWaste\tDay',\tGermany's\t\n'Germany saves food!' awareness-raising week, the \nNetherlands' 'Waste-free Week');\n\n\u2022 creation\tof\tcertification\tschemes\tand\tlabels\t(e.g.\u00a0France's\t\n'anti-food waste label', Luxembourg's 'Antigaspi' \nlogo, Portugal's label for 'sustainable production and \nresponsible\u00a0consumption').\n\nsurplus product channels, intelligent packaging or mandatory \noffering of flexible portion sizes. Small portions for children and \nolder people in restaurants.\n\nOn the other hand, countries have not yet dealt with food waste \nin a separate and comprehensive manner. The food waste \nprevention programmes, currently being developed across \nEurope, are expected to design food waste prevention policy \nin a more systematic manner and introduce more effective \nmeasures, targets and data collection systems for food waste.\n\n2.7.2 Reuse\n\nReuse, examined in this section, is a waste prevention \nactivity that refers to giving a second life to products without \ndiscarding them, meaning that the items do not enter the waste \nmanagement system. Preparation for reuse refers to wasted \nproducts collected through a waste management system that \nundergo limited operations so they can be reused for the same \nfunction as before they became waste. Although reuse and \npreparation for reuse are high on the political agenda, both \nconcepts remain rather vague in the eyes of policymakers. \nThey include very different activities, such as individual sales at \nflea markets, organised waste management and third sector \nactivities. Because of a lack of consensus on the conceptual \nframework, it has so far been difficult to make conclusions \non the actual relevance of reuse and preparation for reuse in \nspecific waste regimes. The question of whether progress takes \nplace within the hierarchy, from disposal and recycling efforts \ntowards more reuse, remains open.\n\nOne of the key barriers is the lack of available data and its \npoor quality, without which the development of more effective \npolicies is not feasible. The revised EU WFD contains a number \nof provisions aimed at increasing reuse as an important form \nof waste prevention \u2014 and specifically aimed at developing \na monitoring framework. The WFD envisages that the \nCommission will adopt an implementing act to establish a \ncommon methodology for reporting and monitoring the reuse \nof products, which was adopted in late 2020. Data produced \nin accordance with this legislation will be available for the first \ntime in 2023, with reference to the year 2021.\n\nAgainst this background, the European Commission initiated a \nstudy to provide input to the development of a methodology \nfor measuring and reporting on the reuse of products and \npackaging and to establish formats for reporting as required \nunder Article 9 of the WFD (Gsell et al., 2019).\n\nWhen it comes to the reuse of packaging, screening of current \npractices has shown that 14 of the Member States that \nresponded intend to make use of the proposals for action \nincluded\tin\tthe\tEU\tpackaging\twaste\tlegislation\tand\t65\u00a0%\tof\tthe\t\nrespondents stated that they have registers of producers of \nreusable packaging (Gsell et al., 2019). The preferences with \nregard to an indicator for measuring the reuse of packaging \n\nBox 2.3 Avoidable vs unavoidable components of \nfood waste\n\nThe term 'food waste' comprises both avoidable and \nunavoidable food waste. Unavoidable food waste \nincludes eggshells, banana peels or coffee grounds. \nAvoidable food waste, on the other hand, would still \nhave been edible at the time of its disposal. This \nincludes leftovers and ripe fruit. This distinction is not \nstable over time and region, as it depends on cultural \neating habits, which vary around the world.\n\nIt is worth noting that the EU definition of food refers \nto food as a whole, including both parts intended and \nnot intended to be eaten ('avoidable' and 'unavoidable'). \nThis is also reflected in the measurement methodology \nestablished through dedicated legislation at the EU level; \nsee Commission Delegated Decision (EU/2019/1597).\n\nA great deal of effort is being put into education and \nawareness-raising campaigns, targeted at both producers and \nconsumers. In this respect, multi-stakeholder dialogues are \nbeing launched and have resulted in voluntary agreements and \ndeclarations on monitoring or reducing food waste. Apart from \nthe potential financial savings associated with reducing food \nwaste, additional arguments have been provided to incentivise \nwaste prevention, e.g. avoided greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMany of these initiatives have proven to effectively prevent food \nwaste. At the same time, available estimations of efficiencies \nhave often shown positive cost-benefit ratios: The avoidance \nof food waste can save significant costs, especially when \nconsidering mitigated environmental burdens (OECD, 2018).\n\nThe brief mapping of initiatives above shows that most \ncountries are active in promoting food waste prevention. \nHowever, the measures implemented so far are relatively light, \nfocusing on voluntary commitments or information provision. \nMany good practice examples are still at the stage of pilot \nprojects and should be broadened by ambitious prevention \npolicies, e.g. standardised date labels, obligatory reporting on \n\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n30 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nwere equally distributed among the following options: \n(1)\u00a0reusable\tpackaging\tplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime\t\nas a share of all packaging placed on the market in a given year; \n(2) reusable packaging in rotation as a share of all packaging \nplaced on the market in a given year; and (3) reuse of packaging \nmeasured as the share of the rotations that reusable packaging \nis used in relation to all packaging used in a given year.\n\nHowever, waste prevention through reuse towards extending \nlifespans has gained importance for a number of product \ngroups. The national waste prevention programmes reviewed \nlist various types of measures, including:\n\n\u2022 supporting the establishment of reuse centres and markets \nfor used building materials, e.g. the network for the \nexchange of building components in Germany;\n\n\u2022 preparing guidelines for public procurement on new \ndevelopment, renovations and infrastructure construction \nthat is material efficient and supports the circular \neconomy\u00a0(Finland);\n\n\u2022 expanding the reuse networks in the federal provinces  \n(e.g. reuse of WEEE);\n\n\u2022 providing information on opportunities for reuse;\n\n\u2022 implementing an information and experience exchange \nplatform for reuse (e.g. Austria);\n\n\u2022 establishing procurement guidelines that facilitate reuse \n(e.g. adaptation of procurement law) or setting specific \nmandatory quotas for reused products;\n\n\u2022 verifying tax law measures in the areas of reuse and repair \nin the framework of a green tax reform (e.g. Austria);\n\n\u2022 organising campaigns to encourage reuse.\n\nThe analysis of different product groups has highlighted \ndiverging framework conditions, economic incentives and \nmarket shares of reuse systems. While reuse is an established \nmarket model for cars, it is still in its infancy for many other \nproduct groups. The recent focus of EU legislation on reuse, as \nexplained above, is expected to motivate European countries to \nintensify their efforts, especially with respect to product groups \naddressed by that legislation, namely electronics, furniture, \nconstruction materials and products and textiles\u00a0(10).\n\n(10) https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0019&from=EN \n\nBox 2.4 Reuse targets in Flanders (Belgium)\n\nThe Flemish government has approved an \nimplementation plan to focus on waste prevention and \nreuse in 2016. The targets are to be achieved by 2022. \nA\treuse\tquota\tof\t7\u00a0kg/inhabitant\tis\tto\tbe\timplemented\t\nby\t2022\tto\tsurpass\tthe\ttarget\tof\t5\u00a0kg/inhabitant\tthat\thas\t\nalready been realised.\n\nThe following measures were defined to support \nreuse\u00a0activities:\n\n\u2022 develop action plans to achieve more efficient reuse \n(better communication, awareness-raising activities, \nmore reuse centres, cooperation with other \norganisations and networks of repair cafes, etc.);\n\n\u2022 review the financing of the reuse sector and look for \nalternatives to include reuse in the product chain;\n\n\u2022 enter into dialogue with companies and \norganisations to raise awareness of the benefits of \nreuse and services provided by reuse initiatives;\n\n\u2022 organise activities to collect reusable goods;\n\n\u2022 investigate opportunities for and obstacles to new \nconcepts for reusable baby nappies and for closing \nthe material chain for disposable nappies.\n\n2.8 Conclusions\n\nThe main policy objective for waste prevention in Europe is \nto manage an absolute decoupling of waste generated from \neconomic growth. At the EU level, this decoupling has not been \nobserved; total waste generation still closely follows economic \ndevelopments. However, for the period 2008-2018, total waste \ngenerated in the EU increased at a much lower pace than the \neconomy, signalling a relative decoupling.\n\nIt needs to be mentioned that waste extileon is influenced by \nmany socio-economic factors, and it is difficult to assess the \neffectiveness of waste prevention measures, because there \nis no one-to-one causality between prevention measures and \nwaste generation. Other demographic and socio-economic \nfactors also affect waste generation, such as population and \nhousehold size or the structure of the economy and its share of \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0019&from=EN\f\nMonitoring progress in waste prevention implementation\n\n31Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nmore waste-intensive(e.g. construction) or less  waste-intensive \n(e.g. services) sectors. In this respect, the adoption of waste \nprevention programmes by EU Member States in 2013 does \nnot appear to have a direct and measurable effect on total \nEU\u00a0waste\u00a0generation.\n\nWhen looking at individual countries, 23 of the 30 examined \nshow decoupling of waste generation from economic growth \nin the period 2008-2018. In fact, 12 countries show a very \nhigh decrease in waste intensity, defined as waste generated \nper\u00a0unit\u00a0GDP.\n\nThe analysis has shown that 10 out of the 32 countries reviewed \nare not covered by a waste prevention programme (as of 2021). \nOnly eight countries have updated their programmes according \nto the revised WFD. This has direct consequences for our \nanalysis: as the new strategic orientation for waste prevention \npolicy, its links with the circular economy agenda and the \nstreams that are more in focus are not yet reflected in the \noverview of waste prevention efforts in Europe. However, this \nmight indicate a thorough overhaul of waste policy in countries \nwhere waste prevention policies will be aligned with broader \nwaste management policies and circular economy strategies, \nunlocking the potential for synergies.\n\nThe waste prevention programmes in place mainly target \nmunicipal waste, plastics and food waste, also reflecting \npolicy priorities at the EU level. However, a widening of \nwaste streams has been observed along with the updates. \nOther streams in focus are hazardous waste, electronics and \nmanufacturing\u00a0waste.\n\nMore than half of the measures adopted by the waste \nprevention programmes examined refer to information \nprovision and awareness-raising campaigns. There are \nindications that countries are moving towards more stringent \nprevention measures, and more regulatory or economic \n\ninstruments, and moving away from information provision, \nwhich might indicate more effective waste prevention in \nthe near future. However, the dominant type of waste \nprevention-related policy intervention is still to provide \ninformation and raise awareness. Shifting from simply \ninforming stakeholders about prevention to increased policy \npressure through legal instruments also indicates more \nmaturity in policy developments around prevention.\n\nHowever, to increase the effectiveness of waste prevention, \ncountries need to further diversify their portfolio of measures \nand align it with concrete targets and indicators. When \nit comes to targets and indicators, they seem to not be \nwidespread yet, presenting a challenge for monitoring the \nprogress of waste prevention implementation. Forthcoming \nactivities, particularly in the areas of food waste and reuse of \nproducts are expected to put these aspects more into focus. \nOverall, the amendment of the EU waste legislation in recent \nyears provides countries with a good opportunity to revise \ntheir waste prevention programmes and integrate these \nsuggestions into their official policy and review the lessons \nlearnt from the evaluation of expired waste prevention \nprogrammes (see EEA, 2021).\n\nOn the other hand, new policy initiatives, under the context \nof the EU's circular economy action plan are expected to \nhave a positive effect on waste prevention. Policy measures \nto support eco-design and in particular design for longevity \nfor a number of consumer products (e.g. electronics and \ntextiles) should in principle have an effect on the waste \ngeneration of these product groups. Similarly, initiatives that \naim to extend products' lifespans, such promoting repair and \nremanufacturing, would delay products from becoming waste. \nOverall, the spirit of the circular economy, which aims to retain \nthe value of materials and products in the economy as long as \npossible, translates into waste prevention, as the less waste is \nproduced the longer we keep using existing products.\n\f\n\u00a9 Adela Nistora, Environment & Me/EEA\n\f\n33Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n3\nPreventing textile waste \n\nin\u00a0Europe\n\n3.1 Introduction and scope\n\nThe textile industry is highly globalised, with millions of producers \nand billions of consumers spread across the world in highly \nlinear value chains involving raw material extraction, production, \ntransport, consumption and the end-of-life phase. Between 2000 \nand 2014, the global production of clothing almost doubled, while \nthe number of garments purchased by the average consumer \nincreased each year (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). In \naddition to the decreasing product quality and low product \nprices, the continual changes in fashion led consumers and the \nindustry to treat clothes as 'disposable' goods (Remy et al., 2016). \nThis phenomenon is captures in the expression 'fast fashion'. \nFast fashion refers to low-cost clothing collections that imitate \ncurrent luxury fashion trends (Joy et al., 2012); it is made possible \nby advanced technology, quick manufacturing and supply chain \ncontrol (Barnes and Lea-Greenwood, 2006). Fashion trends at \nlow prices encourage disposability and rapid turnover and they \nconsequently\tlead\tto\tlarge\tamounts\tof\twaste\t(Fletcher,\u00a02014).\n\nAs a result, the textile product system and the corresponding \ntextile waste are very relevant for applying waste prevention: \ngrowing waste stream, intensive and increasing consumption \nof products and short lifespans. This is recognised by the EU's \n2020 circular economy action plan, which specifically addresses \nthe textile value chain and has a strong focus on reuse and \nthe extension of product lifetime, which is one key pathway \ntowards\u00a0waste\tprevention.\n\nAgainst this background, this study aims to examine and \nassess the feasibility of preventing textile waste in Europe. \nMore concretely, it assesses the textile life cycle from a waste \nprevention perspective by following these steps:\n\n\u2022 compiling knowledge of textile flows and related \nenvironmental impacts;\n\n\u2022 understanding the key drivers of textile waste generation \nalong the value chain in order to scope prevention \nefforts\u00a0accordingly;\n\n\u2022 providing an overview of national textile waste prevention \nprogrammes and other policies and implemented practices \naiming at textile waste prevention;\n\n\u2022 reflecting on intervention points along the textile value \nchain towards waste prevention.\n\nThe study encompasses clothing and household textiles \n(e.g. clothes, towels, bed linen, curtains), while it excludes \nproducts in which textiles are not the dominant constituent \n(e.g. carpets, pillows, duvets). This means that clothing and \nhome textiles consumed by households and by government \nand business (e.g. uniforms used by the public and private \nsectors, bed linen and towels used by hotels and restaurants) \nare considered in the scope of the study. On the other \nhand, technical textiles that are not directly consumed by \nhouseholds (e.g. medical or automotive textiles) are not \nwithin the scope of this report. In the following sections, the \nterm 'textiles' is used in line with the scope of the report as \ndescribed here.\n\n3.2 Production and consumption of \ntextiles\u00a0in Europe and related \nenvironmental impacts\n\n3.2.1 Production and consumption of textiles\n\nTextiles and clothing represent an important manufacturing \nsector in Europe, making Europe the second largest \nexporter of textiles and clothing in the world, after \nChina (Euratex, 2020). Europe is a leading region for \nthe production of high-quality clothing and it is highly \ninnovative\u00a0in\ttextile\tresearch\tand\ttextile\tdesign\t \n(ETC/WMGE, 2019; Euratex, 2020).

For example, each year EU \nhouseholds\tpurchase\tover\t2.6\tmillion\ttonnes\t(6\u00a0kg\tper\tcapita)\t\nof coats, jackets, suits, shirts and trousers, which are often \ndiscarded before the end of their technical lifespan (e.g. because \nof fashion trends, the desire for new clothes or a lack of repair \nskills). As a result, these items have a high potential for reuse and \nare typically sold in second-hand shops across or outside Europe. \nOn the other hand, items such as underwear, pyjamas, hosiery \nand\thandkerchiefs\t(just\tunder\t80\u00a0000\ttonnes\ta\tyear,\t1.3\u00a0kg\tper\t\ncapita) are more likely to be used by their first user until the end \nof their technical life and are less attractive items for reuse (JRC, \n2021). These typically end up in mixed waste. Household textiles, \nespecially when used in a business context (e.g. bedlinen from \nhospitals and hotels) are interesting feedstock for recycling, as \nsuch waste streams have considerable volumes of consistent \nquality, but it can be assumed that they are rarely discarded \nbefore their service life ends and are thus unsuitable for reuse.\n\nA\trecent\tstudy\tin\tthe\tNetherlands\tconcluded\tthat\t5.6\u00a0%\tof\t\nmixed household waste in the country was textiles. Of that \nquantity, around one quarter is textiles that are suitable for \nreuse (https://www.afvalcirculair.nl/publicaties). This indicates \nthat the reuse potential for household clothes and textiles is \ncurrently not exhausted.\n\n3.2.2 Environmental impacts of the textile industry\n\nThe circular economy action plan states that 'textiles are the \nfourth highest pressure category for the use of primary raw \nmaterials and water, after food, housing and transport, and \nthe\tfifth\tfor\tGHG\t[greenhouse\tgas]\temissions'\t(EEA,\u00a02019;\t\nEuropean Commission, 2020b). The predominantly linear \nsystem of the textile industry is based on selling high volumes \nof short-lived clothing, which requires large amounts of \nnatural resources associated with negative societal and \nenvironmental impacts and waste generation (EEA, 2019;  \nETC/WMGE; 2019). The production and consumption \nof textiles and clothing, in particular, have significant \nenvironmental effects, including resource and land \nuse, greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant release. \nPrevention of textile waste by avoiding overconsumption \nand premature discard can thus prevent corresponding high \nenvironmental\u00a0impacts.\n\nFigure 3.2 gives an overview of the environmental impacts \nthat textiles have across their life cycle. The production of \nnatural fibres, such as cotton and wool, requires vast areas \nof arable land and uses large amounts of water, energy \nand agrochemicals. On the other hand, the manufacture of \nsynthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, is based on \nfossil fuel resources. The type and magnitude of impacts \ndepend on the type of fibre, but also on case-specific \nparameters, including specific production processes, the \ndyeing techniques used and fabric construction (van der \nVelden et al., 2014). As all fibres have their own environmental \nburdens and benefits, it is not straightforward to define a \nbest-in-class fibre or fabric (Beton et al., 2014). The production \nof yarn and fabric, however, involves using a myriad of \nprocessing and finishing chemicals as well as energy (see \nFigure 3.2). Production wastes also include process water \nloaded with chemicals and cuttings.\n\nFigure 3.1 Overview of the import, export, production and consumption flows of clothing and household \ntextiles in the EU-27 in 2018\n\nNotes: 'Stock'\trepresents\tthe\ttotal\tflow\tof\tclothing\tand\thousehold\ttextiles\tthrough\tthe\tEU-27\teconomy.\n\nSource: JRC (2021).\n\nIMPORT\n5.2 million tonnes\n(11.8 kg per capita)\n\nEXPORT\n0.76 million tonnes\n(1.7 kg per capita)\n\nAPPARENT CONSUMPTION\n5.4 million tonnes\n(12.3 kg per capital) SEPARATE WASTE COLLECTION\n\n1.6 - 2.5 million tonnes\n(3.6 - 5.7 kg per capita)\n\nEU-27 PRODUCTION\n0.95 million tonnes\n(2.2 kg per capita)\n\nSTOCK\n6.2 million tonnes\n\n(11) Apparent consumption = production + import - export.\n\nhttps://www.afvalcirculair.nl/publicaties\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n35Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nFigure 3.2 Environmental issues arising along the textile value chain\n\nSource: Based on ETC/WMGE (2019).\n\nRE\nUS\n\nE,\n R\n\nEP\nAI\n\nR,\n R\n\nED\n\nISTRIBUTE, REFURBISH, REM\nAN\n\nU\nFACTURE\n\nMATERIALS\nWASTE\n\nECO-DESIGN\n\nPRODUCTION\nAND DISTRIBUTION\n\nCONSUMPTION\nAND STOCK\n\nEM\nISSIO\n\nN\nS\n\nAGRICULTURE, EXTRACTION AND IMPORT OF NATURAL \nRESOURCES, INCLUDING ENERGY CARRIERS\n\nINCINERATION LANDFILL\n\nMinimise\n\nSynthetic fibres\nN\n\natural fibres\n\nChemical recycling\n\nMechanical recycling\n\nWater and energy use; \nextensive use of chemicals\ncausing water pollution\n\nFashion design hardly scopes\nlongevity (durability, repair\nand reusability, recyclability)\n\nNatural fibres are water\nand land intensive\n\nSynthetic fibres \ndominate the market, \nwhich are based on fossil fuels\n\nLow recycling rates, \nincineration and landfilling\nprevails\n\nUse of water and energy; \nrelease of microplastics and\nchemicals through laundering\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n36 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nRecent studies show that, in some cases, there is a greater \ndifference in environmental and climate impact between \ndifferent manufacturers of the same fibres and materials than \nbetween different types of textile fibres (Rex et al., 2019). This is \nimportant, as 80\u00a0% of our textiles' total climate impact occurs in \nthe production phase.\n\nConsequently, the use of chemicals during production and \nprocessing is a particular field of concern. Many chemicals used \nin textiles pose a significant risk to water bodies and human \nhealth, and, as a consequence, many are restricted or banned \nby the EU, including certain phthalates, azo colours and dyes, \nperfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) for surface \ntreatment, chromium (VI) in the tanning of leather for shoes \nand handbags, and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a biocide used \nto prevent mould (European Commission, 2009). For example, \nthe\tproduction\tof\t1\u00a0kg\tof\tcotton\tt-shirts\trequires\tabout\t3\u00a0kg\tof\t\nchemicals, such as dyes and finishing agents (KEMI, 2014).\n\nThe release of microplastics as an environmental impact has \ngained particular attention in recent years. Microplastics are \nreleased during production and the use (washing) of textiles, \n\nincluding polyester, acrylic and nylon, and end up in waste water. \nAs not all microplastics are filtered out in waste water treatment, \na significant share eventually ends up in the ocean. It is estimated \nthat globally about half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres \nare released each year (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). The \nlong-term environmental and health impacts of microplastics \npollution are still poorly understood (Henry et al., 2019; SAPEA, \n2019), but as they are ingested by aquatic species, it is clear they \nmay enter the human food chain, leading to chronic human \nexposure through food products (ETC/WMGE, 2021).\n\nWhen considering the full supply chain, the EU consumption \nof clothing, footwear and household textiles comes out as the \nsecond highest environmental pressure in terms of land use \n(after food), the fourth highest for resource and water use, and \nthe fifth highest for greenhouse gas emissions (EEA, 2019). In \nthe use phase, washing, drying and ironing require water and \nenergy; during these processes chemicals and microplastics are \nreleased into waste water.

Because a large part \nof the textiles that are consumed in Europe is imported from \nelsewhere in the world (mainly Asia), an important part of these \nenvironmental pressures is actually generated outside Europe. \nThis\tis\tthe\tcase\tfor\t85\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tmaterial\tuse,\t92\u00a0%\tof\tthe\twater\t\nuse,\t93\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tland\tuse\tand\t76\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tgreenhouse\tgas\t\nemissions,\tmaking\ttextiles\u00a0(12) the consumption domain with the \nhighest share of environmental impacts taking place outside \nEurope (ETC/WMGE, 2019).\n\n3.3 Textile waste generation in the EU\n\n3.3.1 The amount of textile waste\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement for Member States to report \non the volumes of separately collected used textiles and there \nis no standardised mapping or classification methodology \n(i.e. whether or not certain used textiles are considered waste \nor not) (Eurostat, 2020c; JRC, 2021; Watson et al., 2018). As a \nresult, data on separate collection are gappy and are often \nnon-comparable between countries. Furthermore, collected \namounts of used textiles vary greatly across countries (between \n0.3\tand\t15.3\u00a0kg/person)\t(JRC,\t2021).\n\nIt is estimated that about one third of textiles put on the \nmarket are collected separately, suggesting that two thirds \nend up in residual waste or are stocked. It is estimated that \nbetween\t1.6\u00a0and\t2.5\tmillion\ttonnes\tof\tpost-consumer\ttextiles\t\nis separately collected annually, corresponding to between \n3.6\u00a0and\t5.7\tkg/capita\t(JRC,\t2021).\tAs\tabout\ttwo\tthirds\tof\ttextiles\t\nare synthetic, an important share of this textile waste is of \nplastic origin (ETC/WMGE, 2021). Therefore, there is a significant \namount of non-separately collected textiles that are collected \nmixed with residual waste, rendering them unavailable for \nrecycling\tor\u00a0reuse.\n\nA large part of the textiles collected is meant for reuse (between \n50\u00a0%\tand\t75\u00a0%),\teither\twithin\tthe\tEU\tor\texported\tfor\tforeign\t\nmarkets (Watson et al., 2020). The largest share of the rest of \ncollected textile waste is recycled, but mostly in lower grade \nproducts. Still, high-quality fibre-to-fibre recycling is virtually \nnon-existent at the commercial scale on account of the many \ntechnical and commercial challenges (Textile Exchange, 2020), \nand textiles are generally downcycled into insulation or filling \n\nmaterials (ETC/WMGE, 2021). The remaining two thirds of \ntextile waste generated (about 4 million tonnes of textile waste) \nare assumed to end up in mixed municipal waste streams for \nincineration or landfill; there is thus an important opportunity for \nwaste prevention by encouraging increased reuse. In countries \nwith high separate collection rates, it can be expected that a \nsignificant share of textiles that ends up in the residual waste is of \ninferior quality; in these countries households already make a fair \nselection of those garments that are reusable (and are donated \nfor collection) and those that are not (JRC, 2021).\n\n3.3.2 Key drivers of textile waste generation\n\nThe increasing generation of textile waste cannot be traced \nback to one single driver but rather to a web of events that \noccurred within the past few decades, including a continuous \ndrop in production costs as a result of mass production \n(Ozdamar Ertekin and Atik, 2015) and outsourcing of production \nlabour. At the same time, a trend towards lower quality \nclothing has led to a decrease in clothing prices, making cheap \nmass-produced garments accessible to a wide audience. The \nacceleration of fashion trends, reduced product lifetimes \nand increased affordability have led to an acceleration in the \nconsumption of clothing, resulting in increased waste volumes.\n\nWhile average brands usually release around five collections \nper year, fast fashion brands provide up to 24 new clothing \ncollections each year (Sajn, 2019). It is therefore not surprising \nthat, between 2000 and 2014, the amount of garments \npurchased\tper\tperson\tincreased\tabout\t60\u00a0%\tglobally.\tWithin\t\nthe same period, clothing production doubled and generated \n14 items of clothing for every person on Earth in 2014 (Remy \net al., 2016). It therefore may be considered that consumption \nin the textile industry is not necessarily driven by functional \nbenefits but rather by the drive to satisfy emotional needs and \nby symbolic and social communication, also known as 'style \nconsumption' (Cho et al, 2015). Hence, fast fashion has allowed \neveryone to consume style, follow the latest trends and meet \ntheir emotional needs (Gazzola et al., 2020).\n\nThe growth in the use of digital advertising and social media by \nfast fashion brands has caused a quickly shifting demand from \nconsumers and created a 'buy now, throw away tomorrow' \nculture. A survey conducted by WRAP revealed that the lifespan \nof clothes has decreased and that they are also worn less often. \nIn Europe, the average lifespan of a clothing item is currently \nup to 5 years (WRAP, 2019). Worldwide, the number of times \na\tgarment\tis\tworn\thas\tdecreased\tby\t36\u00a0%\tfrom\t15\tyears\tago\t\n(Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).\n\n(12) Clothing, footwear and household textiles as calculated with Exiobase 3.4.\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n38 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nDigitalisation and data analytics have also served as an \naccelerator, helping fashion brands to develop a nimble and \nefficient supply chain that cuts down production cycles to \nless\tthan\t3\tweeks.\tInventory\tmanagement\tsystems\t(i.e.\u00a0stockkeeping units) have therefore been established to track \ngoods until purchased by the consumer, enabling fast fashion \nbrands to quickly analyse and process data about each store's \ninventory levels and the popularity of each unit and the speed \nat which it sells.\n\nIn the meantime, a wide range of clothing has become accessible \nthrough a mouse click, a phenomenon largely accelerated during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Clothes and sports goods are the top \ncategory of online purchases (see Figure 3.4).\tAround\t65\u00a0%\tof\t\nshoppers in the EU state that they have purchased clothing \nonline\tin\tthe\tpast\t12\tmonths.\tAround\t70\u00a0%\tof\tthese\te-shoppers\t\nare aged 16-24 years (Eurostat, 2020b). According to a survey by \nMastercard,\t48\u00a0%\tof\tEuropean\tconsumers\tpurchase\ttheir\tclothing\t\nand footwear online (Mastercard, 2017).\n\nIn addition to the growth in fashion e-commerce, return rates \nof\tunwanted\tclothing\talso\tincreased.\tWhile\talmost\t10\u00a0%\tof\t\nclothes purchased in stores are returned, the number of clothes \npurchased online being returned is three times higher, which \nrelates to the inability to physically see, feel and try on the \nproduct beforehand (Statista, 2021). The journey of returned \nclothes therefore remains widely unknown. Returned clothes \nthat are not damaged are usually sold at lower prices at \ndiscounters or outlets and/or become deadstock of retailers, \nwhich in general implies a system of 'overordering'. Depending \non the returns policy, retailers have the chance to return \ntheir products to the supplier, who will re-sell those products \nto other markets or treat them as waste. This reverse flow \nalong the supply chain is a crucial part of the clothing industry \nand is legitimised through overproduction, overordering and \nunregulated return policies (Shen and Li, 2015).\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nPercentage\n\nE-learning material\n\nMedicine\n\nComputer hardware\n\nTelecommunication services\n\nFilms/music\n\nFood or groceries\n\nElectronic equipement\n\nBooks/magazines/newspapers\n\nTickets for events\n\nHousehold goods (e.g. furniture, toys)\n\nTravel and holiday accommodation\n\nClothes, sports goods\n\nFigure 3.4 Role of clothing in e-commerce: online purchases, EU-27\n\nSource: Eurostat (2020b).\n\nhttps://www.statista.com\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n39Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n3.4 Policy background on textile \nwaste\u00a0prevention\n\n3.4.1 Global level\n\nThe UN agencies and allied organisations launched the \ninitiative 'Alliance for Sustainable Fashion' in 2018. The main \nobjective of this alliance is to contribute to the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) through coordinated actions in the \nfashion sector\u00a0(13), such as through the promotion of active \ncollaboration, knowledge sharing, strengthening synergies \nand outreach and advocacy. The UN committed to changing \nthe path of fashion towards reduced environmental and social \nimpacts, which resulted in the UN initiative 'SDGs for Better \nFashion', addressing SDGs\u00a04, 9, 12 and 13.\n\nIn addition to these efforts and the establishment of initiatives, \nsuch as the UN One Planet Network and the UN Environment \nProgramme Circularity Platform, programmes aiming \nparticularly at the prevention of textile waste have yet not been \ninitiated in the EU.\n\n3.4.2 EU level\n\nThe circular economy action plan (European Commission, \n2020a) takes a broader approach and paves Europe's way to \nextil responsibility for its own waste. The textile value chain \nhas been selected as a core sector and policy priority for the \ntransition to a circular economy (European Commission, 2020a). \n\nA sectoral plan for textiles is therefore part of the new circular \neconomy strategy (2020a) and a is a priority in the European \nGreen Deal (European Commission, 2019).\n\nFor 2021, the release of an EU strategy for sustainable textiles \nhas been announced\u00a0(14). The upcoming proposal by the \nCommission in this regard will eventually build on existing and \nnew tools to promote the market for sustainable and circular \ntextiles within the EU.\n\nThe\tTextile\tRegulation\t((EU)\tNo\u00a01007/2011)\ton\ttextile\tfibre\t\nnames and related labelling and marking of the fibre \ncomposition of textile products\u00a0(14), for instance, requires that \ntextile products sold in the EU are labelled or marked to provide \ninformation about their fibre composition. Another significant \nbody of the EU policy instrument is the REACH (Registration, \nEvaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals) Regulation ((EC) \nNo\u00a01907/2006),\twhich\trequires\tthe\tregistration\tof\tsubstances\t\nincorporated in textiles during production processes in Europe. \nTextiles produced outside the EU are regulated through \nthe voluntary EU ecolabel for textiles (Commission Decision \n2014/350/EU) and the EU green public procurement criteria for \ntextiles\tproducts\tand\tservices\u00a0(15).\n\nThe revised Waste Framework Directive ((EU) 2018/851), with its \noverall goal of valuing waste as a resource, obliges all Member \nStates to collect its textile waste separately by 2025. This \nregulation is expected to reduce the amount of textile waste \nending up in residual waste and increase the amount that is \navailable for reuse or recycling.\n\nBox 3.1 The role of e-commerce\n\nBecause of the ease of buying clothes, mobile applications and web platforms related to the circular economy and online \nshopping have grown significantly. Nevertheless, demand for circular economy products and alternatives is still rather low \nand most companies that have developed circular e-commerce models for textiles focusing on extended life cycles and \nreuse are small-scale businesses (Faria et al., 2020). The models may involve a pre-paid return label for the shipment of \nold and unwanted personal clothing items with each purchase and incentivising the consumer to participate in a return \nprogramme by offering discounts on the next purchase. Returned clothes can be resold or donated to select charities \n(Cision, 2019).\n\nData on the textile flows involved in e-commerce for the reuse of second-hand textiles are difficult to obtain. Informal \nreuse and the new market that has emerged via apps and the web are especially a challenge.\n\nThe Swedish Environmental Protection Agency study on e-commerce of second-hand clothing indicated that such activities \nincreased\t32\u00a0%\tin\t1\tyear\t(2016\u20142017).\tThe\tamount\twas\tapproximately\t0.13\u00a0kg\tper\tperson,\tor\tequivalent\tto\tthe\tweight\t\nof one cap. Women's clothes dominates the market and represents almost half of the textiles sold. Children's clothes \nrepresent about one third and men's about one sixth.

Reuse and recycling \noutlets will need to be created, as the current sorting and \nrecycling capacities are not sufficient to process the anticipated \nvolumes (Hardy, 2020). However, it is also expected that at least \nhalf of these additional volumes will comprise non-reusable \ntextile\twaste\t(JRC,\u00a02021).\n\n3.4.3 EEA member countries' national and regional \nwaste prevention programmes \n\nWaste prevention programmes have been officially adopted \nby 30 EEA member countries: the 27 EU Member States and \nthree non-EU countries that are members of the EEA (Iceland, \nNorway and Switzerland). An assessment of these programmes \nshowcases the measures, indicators and targets envisaged for \ntackling textile waste prevention.\n\nMeasures\n\nThe slight majority (16 of 30) of waste prevention programmes \nin Europe already include measures that specifically address \n\ntextile waste. In total, 40 measures have been recorded across \nall programmes. Some programmes. e.g. those of Denmark or \nSlovenia, have specific sub-chapters that deal with textile waste \ngeneration and linked environmental impacts.\n\nThe measures to prevent  textile waste cover a wide range \nof types, from voluntary and simply suggested measures to \nmarket-based incentives and stringent regulatory market \ninterventions. They mainly relate to the reuse and repair \nof textiles, i.e. the improvement of collection systems and \nmarket penetration of used clothes to enable, improve and \nincrease their reuse (see Table 3.1). Furthermore, it was \nnoted that agreements and partnerships tend to focus on \nawareness-raising campaigns and that regulatory measures, \nso far, focus on reducing the use of chemicals in textiles \n(part of qualitative waste prevention, referring to reducing \nenvironmental impacts from waste management).\n\nTextiles and especially clothing might, of course, also be \nincluded in general waste prevention measures, such as in the \nsupport for reuse of discarded products in general. Additionally, \ntextile waste prevention is considered as an action field in \nnational and regional policy strategies and regulations beyond \nthe waste prevention programmes (see Box 3.2).\n\nTable 3.1 Examples of textile waste prevention measures listed in the national waste \nprevention\u00a0programmes\n\nInformation and \nawareness-raising\n\nAnalysis of the textile industry (e.g. textile material flows) (Austria)\n\nTechnically ensure the dissemination of information and awareness programmes for a \nprogressive increase in the number of products collected for further use, e.g. textiles, clothing, \nfootwear and other reusable products (Czechia)\n\nEstablishment of a voluntary event for selling used clothing before the start of the school \nyear\u00a0(Greece)\n\nMarket-based incentives Reduce value added tax on the repair of bicycles, shoes, leather goods, clothing and electrical \nappliances,\tfrom\t25\u00a0%\tto\t12\u00a0%\tas\tof\t1\u00a0January\t2017\tin\tSweden and also in Austria\tfrom\t20\u00a0%\tto\t\n10\u00a0%\tfrom\t1\u00a0January\t2021\n\nReduce\tcost\tof\trepair\tthrough\ta\t50\u00a0%\tdeduction\tof\tlabour\tcost\tfor\trepairs\tof\ttextiles\tthrough\t\ngovernment subsidy (Sweden)\n\nLow\tvalue\tadded\ttax\ton\tthe\trepair\tof\tclothing,\te.g.\tof\t6\u00a0%\t(Belgium)\n\nReduction in patent taxes for small businesses whose activities lead to the reuse of a product \n(e.g. repair of shoes, furniture and clothing) (Bulgaria)\n\nWork to establish environmental targets for public procurement of textiles and textile \nservices\u00a0(Denmark)\n\nVoluntary agreements \nand cooperation \nplatforms\n\nPartnerships with vendors to increase the market share of eco-labelled textiles or textiles that \ncontain a minimal amount of harmful substances (Iceland)\n\nA partnership with companies and organisations with the slogan 'Give your clothes a longer life' \n(Denmark)\n\nRegulatory measures Support stricter international regulations regarding the use of chemicals in textiles (Norway)\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n41Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nIndicators\n\nCurrently, only 6 out of 31 national and regional waste \nprevention programmes include specific indicators on textile \nwaste prevention (Box 3.3). The majority of these indicators \nfocus on reuse or preparation for reuse of clothing and \nfootwear. Some indicators also cover qualitative prevention \n(e.g.\u00a0with\tregard\tto\teco-labelled\tclothing)\tand\tthe\tquantities\tput\t\non the market \u2014 based on available consumer market statistics \n(e.g. the Icelandic programme uses indicators on consumer \nexpenditure as an indicator for waste prevention).\n\nBox 3.2 Examples of national and regional policy strategies and regulations beyond the waste prevention \nprogrammes\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nThe steps taken in the Netherlands over the past 10 years addressing the intervention points along the textile value \nchain can be highlighted as best practice. In 2012, the Netherlands introduced a Green Deal on textiles, with the overall \ngoal of halving the quantities of textiles in residual waste between 2012 and 2015. The Green Deal aimed to achieve this \nthrough improved mapping of textile flows, common communications on what can and cannot be delivered to containers, \ninitiatives aimed at behavioural change and assisting municipalities in setting achievable targets. This was followed by the \nDutch Agreement on Sustainable Garments and Textile in 2016, signed by a broad coalition of partners, including industry \nassociations, trade unions, non-governmental organisations and the Government of the Netherlands. These businesses \nand organisations thereby committed to extil measures towards a reduction of waste in the garment and textile sector in \naccordance with the European circular economy ambitions (SER, 2016). Furthermore, the Dutch circular textile programme \n2020-2025 has also been implemented, setting objectives along the supply chain enabling long-term use and reuse of \ntextiles (van Veldhoven, 2020). In 2021, additional goals/targets for reuse within the Netherlands were set in a progress \nreport on the Dutch circular textile waste programme 2020-2025, which was presented to the Dutch parliament. By 2025, \n10\u00a0%\tof\ttextiles\tcollected\tin\tthe\tNetherlands\tneeds\tto\tbe\treused\twithin\tthe\tNetherlands;\tby\t2030\tthis\tshould\tbe\t15\u00a0%\t\n(Government of the Netherlands, 2021).\n\nGermany\n\nWith the amendment to the Circular Economy Act, the Due Diligence Act (in German 'Obhutspflicht') was introduced by \nthe German government in 2020, marking a new form of product responsibility. It focuses on goods returned following \nonline purchases as a critical factor for waste generation and refers to all products and their distribution processes \n(including transport and storing). By focusing on the textile industry in particular, the regulation represents an upfront \nduty to prevent textile waste (BMU, 2020). The Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety \n(BMU) is currently conducting transparency dialogues with trade associations, online retailers, tertiary users and others \nto understand the underlying reasons for product destruction and how transparency on this matter could be achieved \n(BMU, 2019). Once transparency measures addressing the destruction of textile products are implemented, the volumes of \ntextile\twaste\tin\tGermany\tcan\tbe\testimated.and\thousehold\ttextiles\tis\tremarkable,\tit\tamounts\tto\tonly\tabout\t1\u00a0%\tof\tnew\tsales\t\n(Elander et al., 2019). \n\nOverall, the uptake of indicator in countries is hampered by the \nfact that textile waste statistics are not collected in all countries. \nTherefore, some countries resort to proxy indicators, such \nas the amount of textiles placed on the market, to estimate \nthe effect of prevention measures. Other countries choose to \nmonitor specific aspects of waste prevention, such as reuse, \nwhich is of course very relevant for textiles. However, not \nmany countries have chosen to include specific indicators for \nmonitoring textile waste prevention. This status might change \nwith the introduction of the mandatory separate collection of \ntextile waste in 2025 and the forthcoming EU textile strategy.\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n42 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nTargets\n\nNone of the currently available waste prevention programmes \ninclude quantified targets for preventing textile waste. The \nNetherlands, however, recently adopted a reuse target of \n10\u00a0%\tof\ttextiles\tcollected\tby\t2025,\tincreasing\tto\t15\u00a0%\tby\t2030\t\n(Government of the Netherlands, 2021). Textile waste is \nnevertheless often mentioned in the context of general targets \nfor municipal solid waste (e.g. in France) or with regard to \nwaste products that are supposed to be collected separately in \nthe\u00a0future.\n\nThe absence of concrete targets is a major drawback of \nefforts to prevent textile waste, as a solid target drives the \ndevelopment of comprehensive policies, including subsequent \nmeasures to support the target and indicators for monitoring \nprogress and data collection.\n\nConclusions on textile waste prevention in the national \nprevention programmes\n\nCompared with prevention measures on other waste \nstreams, such as plastics and packaging waste (see EEA, 2019), \nmeasures targeting textile waste are fewer in number but a \nhigher share of textile-related measures aimed at qualitative \nprevention, inspired by the knowledge that chemicals in \ntextiles might be harmful for humans (thus not targeting waste \nprevention\u00a0directly).\n\nThe analysis also shows that, despite the increasing awareness \nof the steeply increasing amount of textile waste generated and \nthe serious environmental impacts occurring along the value \n\nBox 3.3 Textile waste prevention indicators in national waste prevention programmes\n\nAustria Quantity of reusable used products (e.g. textiles) collected per year\n\nQuantity of reused products (e.g. textiles) sold annually\n\nCyprus Quantity of materials (WEEE, clothes, furniture) re-introduced into the market (number of pieces)\n\nRepair of WEEE, clothing, furniture and toys (percentage)\n\nCzechia The amount of textiles, footwear and selected reusable products collected, in tonnes/year \n\nDenmark Consumption of clothing and textiles, including recycled items\n\nTrends in the prevalence of eco-labelled clothing and textiles\n\nIceland The market share of clothing produced by environmentally friendly means or containing small \nquantities of hazardous substances\n\nAverage household clothing purchases per year (adjusted for consumer price index, \nexcluding\u00a0housing)\n\nSlovenia The amount of textile waste and waste clothing\n\nNetherlands Overall reduction of waste\n\nReduction in the amount of textiles discarded\n\nNote: WEEE, waste electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nchain, the issue of preventing textile waste has just started \nto gain attention and relevance in national waste prevention \nprogrammes. The circular economy action plan of the EU, \nwhich was recently adopted, puts extra emphasis on the textile \nproduct system. It is expected that the next versions of the \nnational waste prevention programmes will increasingly adopt \nmeasures to address textile waste prevention across the board \nof targets, measures, indicators and data collection systems.\n\n3.5 Intervention points for textile waste \nprevention along the life cycle stages\n\nThis section assesses waste prevention measures that can \nbe undertaken throughout textiles' life cycle that lead to the \nreduction of textile waste. It highlights barriers to and success \nfactors for the implementation of measures and draws \nconclusions to support policy options. As intervention measures \ncan and should be considered at each stage along the value \nchain, the measures are discussed for each stage separately (for \nan overview of the value chain, see Figure 3.2).\n\n3.5.1 Product design\n\nProduct design represents a crucial phase for the longevity of \ntextiles through material choice, fibre blend and the production \nprocesses used (e.g. knitting or sewing techniques). The design \nphase also determines the potential for textiles to be recovered \n(i.e. recycled or upcycled; UNEP, 2020), which could also be \nconsidered waste prevention by avoiding environmental impacts \nfrom waste management (i.e. avoiding disposal). Eco-design is \n\nhttps://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2021/05/20/voortgangsrapportage-circulair-textiel\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n43Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nthe principle of designing for longevity, which again consists of \nthree design principles: (1) design for durability, (2) design for \nlong-lasting style and (3) design for disassembly (Circular Fashion, \n2019). Design for durability aims to create textile products that \nare resilient to wear and tear and can withstand abrasion and \nwashing, whereas design for long-lasting style aims to create \ntimeless items that appeal to a broad audience by satisfying \nconsumers' fashion sense. Lastly, design for disassembly aims \nto create products that can be taken apart easily to facilitate \nmaintenance, repair, reuse or recycling (ETC/WMGE, 2019).\n\nEver more brands and businesses are establishing eco-design \nprinciples aiming for high-quality products with a long use \nphase and they therefore position themselves in new emerging \n'slow fashion' markets. Some even follow the concept of 'zero \nwaste design'. Technique-wise, zero waste design involves fitting \nall the flat pieces of the clothing pattern together like a jigsaw \npuzzle so that no fabric is wasted. Considering that roughly \n15\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tfabric\tis\tdiscarded\twhen\ta\ttypical\tgarment\tis\tmade,\t\nthe cumulative effect of zero waste manufacturing can have \nsignificant environmental benefits (Wright, 2017). Labels and \ncertification programmes addressing the longevity of textiles \nand/or including the aspect of longevity in existing labels and \ncertifications can also provide an incentive for such waste \nprevention-compliant design.\n\nAn approach at the policy level has been made in the Dutch \ncircular textile programme 2020-2025, which states that all \ntextile products should be designed for long-term use by \nusing materials that are long lasting and can be reused to a \nhigh standard (van Veldhoven, 2020). An extended producer \nresponsibility (EPR) scheme for textiles to accelerate these \nprocesses is discussed (Government of the Netherlands, 2020). \nHowever, as ubiquitous incentives and regulatory measures \nto encourage eco-design are still missing, the consideration \nof longevity in the textile industry is lacking and compounded \nwith a long implementation phase for such an initiative. This \nstage is therefore crucial, as it is the design phase that strongly \ndetermines the technical reusability, repairability and, hence, \nlongevity of textile products (coupled with circular business \nmodels to recirculate unwanted textiles to new users).\n\n3.5.2 Production and distribution\n\nThe production phase involves fibre and fabric production, \ncutting and sewing. Garment construction processes determine \nthe quality of the resulting textile product, its durability and \nlifespan. Production systems for fast fashion are oriented \nmore towards speed than quality, creating a vast amount \nof 'disposable' clothing. Gentle (i.e. sustainable) production \nsystems with regard to chemical use in particular can ensure \nlong-lasting clothing items that are recyclable.\n\nOne core issue at this stage, however, is the overproduction that \ngenerates large amounts of (unused) textile items ending up as \nwaste. To prevent overproduction, some brands have embraced \n\na demand-driven model in which consumers pre-order \ngarments. Moreover, brands could support customers to take an \neven greater guiding role in the development of clothing items \nby producing customised items on demand, based, for instance, \non consumers' designs or simulations. Social media, bloggers, \ninfluencers and peer review play an important role in this trend.\n\nPolicy interventions for the textile production stage are not yet \npresent at the European level. However, possible considerations \nof measures such as a ban on the destruction of unsold items \n(already in place in France and Germany and potentially to be \nincluded in the EU sustainable products initiative) or waste \nprevention targets for the production stage can influence the \navoidance of production waste and incentivise the control \nof\u00a0overproduction.\n\nWith the rising relevance of online clothing markets, slow fashion \ntrends are required to adjust and reorient accordingly. While \nonline platforms ease and accelerate the purchase of clothing, \nthey also have potential for raising awareness and changing \nbehaviour\tthrough\tthe\tpromotion\tof\tcertain\tsocial\tnorms\t(e.g.\u00a0by\t\n'green nudging'). Alternative business models (e.g. reuse or \nleasing) are therefore increasingly implemented by start-ups.\n\n3.5.3 Use and maintenance\n\nThe use phase of clothing has shortened significantly over \nrecent decades. This is to some extent explained by the lower \nquality of clothing items provided on the market but also by \nchanges in consumption patterns and societal expectations of \nclothing. Apparel is no longer purchased to fulfil an essential \nhuman need but to meet seasonal fashion trends.\n\nAccording to a survey, around one in five consumers purchase \nclothing items every 14 days and are 'high-frequency \npurchasers' (WRAP, 2019). Around half of consumers purchase \nmonthly or every few months ('medium-frequency purchasers'), \nwhile one in three make purchases a few times a year or less \n('low-frequency purchasers'). The study also reveals a high \nassociation between frequency of purchase and age, as people \nbetween 18 and 34 years are more likely to be classified as \nhigh-frequency purchasers. It is the same group that reports the \nshortest longevity of their clothing (WRAP, 2019). This reveals \na clear group for targeting with awareness-raising campaigns \non reuse and repair activities and new consumption models. \nIt is, however, the same age group that is also targeted by fast \nfashion models and incentives to consume it on social media.\n\nBy encouraging consumers to use the concepts of longer \nuse, reuse and shared use, the volumes of textiles purchased \n(and wasted) could be reduced. This, however, requires \nproduct design and logistics services supporting collaborative \nconsumption models (Box 3.4). One barrier for reuse models \nsuch as second-hand clothing includes prejudices about worn \nclothing in terms of quality, hygiene or diversity of products on \noffer (Kleinh\u00fcckelkotten et al., 2017).\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n44 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nDespite the variety of awareness-raising campaigns that can \nbe undertaken to address the challenges described, a certain \nattitude-behaviour gap remains, which raises questions about \nthe alignment between awareness and actual actions to prevent \ntextile waste.\n\nReuse or repair services could be encouraged by economic \nincentives, such as tax breaks. The Swedish government set \neconomic incentives for the longer use of consumer items \nby giving tax breaks for repair services in 2017. The value \nadded tax (VAT) for repair services, including those on textiles, \ndecreased\tby\tabout\t50\u00a0%\t(from\t25\u00a0%\tto\t12\u00a0%).\tThe\trationale\t\nbehind this is that, by reducing the overall costs of repair \nservices, the use phase of items would be extended and waste \nprevented. Although an exact correlation cannot be drawn, an \nincrease in shoe repair services has been noticed within the \npast few years (Dalhammar et al., 2020).\n\nRecently, circular economy-inspired business models that \npromote sharing or leasing of clothes have been developed \nby new companies or by modifying the business models of \nexisting companies. Most of these models target specific \nclothing types, such as long-lasting coats or baby clothes, \nwhich are more likely to be discarded by consumers before \n\nBox 3.4 Examples of collaborative textile consumption models\n\nReuse: fashion library\n\nAn example of a collaborative consumption business model for extended life cycles of textiles is the clothing library, in \nwhich\ta\tmonthly\tmembership\tfee\t(often\tEUR\u00a030-60)\tallows\tmembers\tto\tborrow\ta\tspecific\tnumber\tof\tpieces\tof\tclothing\tin\ta\t\nset time, typically a few weeks.\n\nZamani et al. (2017) found that clothing libraries can extend the life cycle of a garment two to four times and proportionally \nreduce the production of new clothing and the associated waste generation and other environmental impacts.\n\nClothing libraries are typically small-scale enterprises, many of which are managed as secondary side businesses. The \ncurrent impact on textile waste material flows is minor (Tojo et al., 2012), albeit steadily increasing. Several studies (Elander \net al., 2017; Zamani et al., 2017; Yuan and Shen, 2019 ) report the importance of easy access and services (e-platforms and \ncentral locations of shops). Efficient logistics and good agreements with suppliers are crucial. Brand owners are generally \nquite positive about clothing libraries, even though one can see a contradiction with the retail model. Some brand owners \nhave set up their own renting services, with the additional benefit of increased customer engagement and decreased \nproduct returns (Yuan and Shen, 2019).\n\nSwap till you drop\n\nA clothing swap is a type of swap meet during which participants exchange their valued, but no longer used, clothing for \nclothes that they will use. A clothing swap underlines the difference between 'end-of-use' and 'end-of-life' items and tries to \nget maximum use from end-of-use items (Rathinamoorthy et al., 2019).\n\nAs part of its 'Love your clothes' campaign, Milieu Centraal in the Netherlands is promoting the informal, non-commercial \ncollaborative consumption system for clothing, called 'Swap till you drop' (Milieu Centraal, undated). It informs the \nconsumer about the rules and benefits and gives practical advice on how to arrange clothing swaps. It also links to public \nclothing exchange events taking place at various locations in the Netherlands and to social media sites, where interested \nswap party organisers can post about their own event.\n\ntheir service life has ended. Although these models aim to \nuse clothes as much as possible and avoid discarding them \nwhile still useful, there is currently no evidence on their \neffect on waste prevention. Depending on other factors, \nsuch as the cost of such leasing or sharing services, these \nmodels might risk increasing the number of clothing items in \npeople's wardrobes and, perhaps, consequently increasing the \nproduction of clothes.\n\nA common public policy measure that can promote circularity \nand waste prevention is green public procurement, which is \nincreasingly seen as offering significant opportunities in this \nrespect (Box 3.5). Green public procurement can encourage \nshifts towards the use of non-toxic chemicals in production, \nzero waste design and extended life cycles based on greater \ndurability, reparability, etc. Public procurers can, for example, \nshare assets (e.g. in terms of joint procurement and reuse) or \nset requirements that ensure a prolonged product life through \nmaintenance,\trepair\tand\tdesign\tfor\tdurability\t(Alhola\u00a0et\tal.,\t\n2018). Other sector-specific opportunities for circular public \nprocurement aiming to prevent waste are extending the life \ncycle by renting workwear instead of owning it or setting \nrequirements for the elimination of toxic substances, aiming to \nachieve qualitative waste prevention. \n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n45Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nBox 3.5 Example of green public procurement and \ntextile waste prevention \n\nAn example of successful textile waste prevention was \ngiven by the Herning municipality in Denmark. The \naim was to extend the lifespan of working clothes and \nto ensure that the clothes and materials were used \nmore efficiently. Detailed guidance on the criteria for \nthe reuse, repair and disposal of working clothes was \ndeveloped. Estimated savings for the municipality \nwere\tEUR\t6\u00a0700\tand\t1\u00a0011\u00a0t\u00a0CO2 over a 4-year period \nin Herning's technical operations department (Hillgr\u00e9n \net al., 2015). Extrapolating these figures based on \nthe number of inhabitants in Herning implies that, if \nimplemented at the national level, such a relatively easy \nmeasure would result in a saving of 117.1\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2 for all \nof\tDenmark\t(with\ta\tsaving\tof\tEUR\u00a0776\u00a0000\tover\t4\tyears\t\nfor its 5.79 million inhabitants.\n\nBox 3.6 The role of non-governmental \norganisations in textile reuse\n\nToday, in the majority of European countries, \nthe collection of used textiles is mainly handled \nby non-governmental organisations or charity \norganisations, which provide this service to get raw \nmaterials for their own activities, reselling or recycling. \nFinnish and Swedish reports indicate that the volumes \ncollected are 3-4\u00a0kg/inhabitant (Belleza and Luukka, \n2018; Dahlbo et al., 2016), which is in the same order \nas in France (3.18\u00a0kg/inhabitant per year), where the \ncollection is more formal and arranged based on the \nfrench extended producer responsibility scheme for \ntextiles (Bukhari et al., 2018).\n\nDenmark has a well-developed market for the reuse of \ntextiles through charity shops. In 2016, around 10\u00a0600 \ntonnes of textiles were reused in Denmark and around \n15\u00a0300\u00a0tonnes were exported to be reused elsewhere \n(Milj\u00f8styrelsen, 2018).\n\nTypically, only a smaller share of collected textiles \nare going to domestic reuse. In Finland this is 21\u00a0%,\t\nand in Sweden and France even less. The bulk of all \ntextiles collected are exported (Bukhari et al., 2018; \nWatson\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\t2020).\n\nThe markets for domestic, European and international \nreuse have been shrinking in the last few years. The \nquality of new clothing is becoming lower and the \nexport of clothing to developing countries is becoming \nmore difficult. The latter is because of the demand for \nbetter quality items and, moreover, some countries \nhave placed bans on the import of used goods. In \nFrance, for example, the volumes of items going for \nreuse has decreased by between 10\u00a0%\tand\t15\u00a0%\tduring\t\nthe last 3-4 years (Bukhari et al., 2018).\n\n3.5.4 Reuse\n\nHigh-quality textile reuse represents an opportunity for the \nEuropean textiles industry to reduce its environmental impacts, \nproviding that sufficient sorting capacity is available, including \npre-sorting at source (e.g. separate collection of carpets, reusable \nclothing, denim, non-reusable items). By encouraging consumers \nto use textiles for longer and to repair, reuse and share their \ntextiles, the volumes of textiles purchased and wasted could \nbe reduced, despite potential rebound effects linked to the \nconsumption of second-hand clothing. Currently, textile collection \nand sorting for reuse are often dominated by non-governmental \norganisations\tand\tcharity\torganisations\t(Box\u00a03.6).\tWhen\tthe\t\nseparate collection of textile waste is obligatory in all Member \nStates\tafter\t1\u00a0January\t2025,\tharmonisation\tof\tsorting\tprocedures\t\namong Member States will be crucial to support efficient intra-EU \ntrade of reusable textiles (ETC/WMGE, 2021).\n\nEPR systems with eco-modulated fees are often proposed to \nencourage the collection of items for reuse and recycling, while \nstimulating the use of recycled fibres in new products. EPR \nschemes might lead to waste prevention directly in the case of \nthe reuse of collected textiles without preparation or indirectly \nby, for instance, promoting durable textile design through \neco-modulation. To date, France is the only Member State that \nhas\testablished\ta\tmandatory\tEPR\tscheme\u00a0(16) (see Box 3.7) for \nclothing, footwear and household textiles (Article L-541-10-3 of \n\n(16) An EPR promotes life cycle improvements in products by giving the manufacturer the responsibility for the final disposal phase in particular \n(Lindhqvist, 2000). \n\nthe Code de l'Environnement). According to this regulation, all \nlegal entities presenting new textiles and clothing on the French \nmarket (i.e. garments, footwear and household linen) are held \nresponsible for the end-of-life phase. As a consequence, the \ncollection rate for reuse and recycling in France doubled from \n18\u00a0%\tto\t36\u00a0%\tbetween\t2009\tand\t2017\t(Bukhari\tet\tal.,\t2018;\tEllen\t\nMacArthur Foundation, 2017).

Exchanges of clothes \nbetween family and friends and the blooming of peer-to-peer \nonline market platforms constitute a potentially significant part \nof textile reuse. However, no data exist on the amounts of such \nreused textiles in Europe.\n\nFigure 3.5 outlines all potential measures and innovative steps \nthat can be undertaken throughout the textile supply chain to \nprevent textile waste. Those steps outline business, consumer \nand policy options following the idea of a circular economy. \nOverall, textile waste can be prevented effectively by following \nthe guiding principle of 'reduce by design', which is applied at \nthe earliest stages of the value chain with the aim of reducing \nthe number of materials, chemicals and waste. Additionally, \nretention loops, once implemented along the supply chain, \ncan ensure the use of clothing to its maximum, guaranteeing \nextensive textile waste prevention. This could, for instance, take \nplace through a shift in business models, informed consumers \nand transparent and traceable value chains.\n\n3.6 Challenges and potentials for textile waste \nprevention in the EU\n\nAlongside the value chain, there are different types of measures \nthat have the potential to prevent the generation of textile \nwaste by extending lifespans. A significant volume is assumed \nto be prevented by repair and reuse activities, which can be \nachieved through eco-design, collaborative consumption \nmodels, promoting emotional attachment to clothing and more.\n\nAs the actual quantity of textile waste generated remains \nwidely unknown, quantitative assessments of the potential for \nprevention potentials have not been made so far. Estimates, \nhowever, have been made based on consumers' consumption \n\nBox 3.7 The French extended producer responsibility scheme\n\nThe French extended producer responsibility scheme for clothing, footwear and home textiles purchased by households \nwas introduced in 2007. Since then, companies that produce or import clothing, footwear or home textiles into French \nmarket have been held responsible for the collection, reuse and recycling of their products at the end-of-life stage.\n\nUnder this regulation, producers can either organise their own collection, reuse and recycling system or contribute to \nan accredited producer responsibility organisation (PRO), which will carry out these activities. So far, EcoTLC has been \nthe only accredited PRO in the area of textiles operating under a mandate that is negotiated with the government every \n6\u00a0years.\tSince\tthen,\tcompanies\tthat\tproduce\tor\timport\tclothing,\tfootwear\tor\thome\ttextiles\tinto\tthe\tFrench\tmarket\tare\t\nheld responsible for the product at every stage of its life cycle, from eco-design, to the collection, reuse and recycling of \ntheir\tproducts\tat\tthe\tend-of-life-stage.\tThe\tmandate\tuntil\tthe\tend\tof\t2019\tincluded\ttargets\tof\t50\u00a0%\tof\ttextiles\tand\tfootwear\t\nplaced\ton\tthe\tmarket\tto\tbe\tdiverted\tfrom\tresidual\twaste\tstreams\tby\t2019,\twith\tat\tleast\t95\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttextiles\tand\tfootwear\t\ncollected\tgoing\tfor\treuse,\trecycling\tor\tsolid\trecovered\tfuel\tand\tno\tmore\tthan\t2\u00a0%\tgoing\tto\tlandfill.\tIn\tDecember\t2019,\t\nEco\u00a0TLC\t(now\tcalled\tRefashion)\twas\tgiven\ta\tmandate\tuntil\t31\u00a0December\t2022.\n\nand use behaviour or through surveys of unused clothing in \nhouseholds. WRAP, following a household study on clothing, \ncame\tto\tthe\tconclusion\tthat\t30\u00a0%\tof\tclothing\tin\tthe\taverage\t\nwardrobe has not been worn for at least a year, mostly because \nit no longer fits (WRAP, 2012). This reflects the volume of clothes \nthat could be prevented from being thrown out if versatility \nwere considered in product design, for instance. As the average \nhousehold\twardrobe\tis\tworth\taround\tEUR\u00a04\u00a0400,\tthe\taverage\t\nconsumer\tcould\tsave\taround\tEUR\u00a01\u00a0320\tover\ttheir\twardrobe's\t\nlifetime by overcoming this inefficiency. The study further \nestimates that extending the active use of clothes for 9 months \nwould\tsave\tabout\tEUR\u00a05.5\tbillion\tof\tresources\tused\tin\tthe\t\nsupply, laundering and and disposal of clothing.

According to a study by McKinsey, in which the \neconomics of emission abatement within the fashion sector is \nillustrated, increasing the repairability of clothing would have \nthe potential to extend the average use of clothing by 1 year \n(approximately\t35\u00a0%)\tand\treduce\tthe\toverproduction\tof\tthe\t\nclothing\tindustry\tfrom\t20\u00a0%\tto\t10\u00a0%\t(McKinsey,\t2020).\n\nOne key challenge remains the collection system.

Hence, the obligation for Member States to implement a \nsystem of separate textile collection has considerable potential \nto eliminate textile waste from landfilling. However, increased \nwaste collection does not necessarily lead to an equivalent \nincrease in reuse. It might be argued that good-quality textiles \nalready find their way to reuse currently, while lower quality \ntextiles are thrown away. Therefore, an increased collection rate \nwould make more textiles available for recycling, but maybe not \nas much for reuse.\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n47Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nFigure 3.5 Textile waste prevention measures along the value chain, involving economic, political and \nsocietal innovations. \n\nRE\nU\n\nSE\n, R\n\nEP\n\nAIR, LONGER USE, SHARED U\nSE\n\nWASTE\n\nECO-DESIGN\n\nPRODUCTION\nAND DISTRIBUTION\n\nCONSUMPTION\nAND STOCK\n\nSynthetic fibres\nN\n\natural fibres\n\nChemical recycling\n\nMechanical recycling\n\nCircular textiles awareness\n\nSustainable productions\nand product policies.\nTax on resource use\n\nand environmental report\n\nR&D support\nInvestment support\nfor SMEs\n\nStartup and SME\ninvestment funding\nand support\n\nPurchase less\nfrequently/timeless\nitems rather than \nseasonal fashion clothes\n\nMindshift from\nowning to sharing\n\nPromoting longer\nuse\n\nPromoting reuse\n\nMaintenace \nguidelines\n\nGreen public\nprocurement\n\nReduced VAT\non sharing\n\nReduced VAT on \nrepair\nLabour subsidies\n\nReuse targets\nReduced VAT on \nsecond hand\n\nCompetition support\nto secondhand\nstores\n\nExtended producer\nresponsibility\n\nSeparated collection\nobligations\n\nRecycling and recycled\ncontent targets\n\nQuality requirements\nfor recycled fibres\n\nClear end-of-waste criteria\nInvestment funding and\nsupport\n\nTaxes and bans on incineration\nand landfill\n\nWaste prevention\ncampaigns\n\nRevaluing handicraft\nDemand for recycled\nfibres and products\n\nWaste separation and\ncollection campaigns\n\nElimination of \nincineration \nand landfill\n\nDigitalisation and\nonline platforms\n\nDesign for longevity\n\nEco design guidelines\n\nDurability standards\n\nPersonalisation\n\nPro-sumerism\n\nSafe by design\n\nPhasing out of \nchemicals of concern\n\nDurability\nlabelling\n\nSusatainability\nin designer eduction\n\nDesign \nfor durability\nand longevity\n\nDesign \nknowledge\n\nhubs\n\nUse of recycled fibres\n\nSustainable sourcing labelling\n\nResource taxes\non new fibres\n\nDemand for\nsustainable fibres\n\nQuality and safety\nrequirements\n\nResearch on \nsafe substitute\n\nmaterials\n\nDurable fibre mix\n\nSustainability in\nmaterials engineering\n\neduction\n\nBinding minimum\nstandards and \n\ncomplementary voluntary\ntargets\n\nEnhanced traceability\nReuse of fabric\nUpcycling\nYarn respinning\n\nResource\nefficient \nproduction Renting and \n\nleasing services\nSharing platforms\n\nDurable products\n\nLegal support\n\nMaintenance \nservices\n\nRepair services\n\nTake back and \nresale\nReuse stores\nand platforms\n\nCollection schemes\nManual and \nautomated sorting\n\nLocal production\nProduction on demand\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nECO DESIGN SHARED USE\n\nREUSE AS PRODUCT\n\nLONGER USE\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nREUSE AS MATERIAL\n\nSAFE AND CLEAN MATERIALS\n\nSUSTAINABLE FIBRE PRODUCTION\n\nWASTE PREVENTION\n\nRepair skills \nand DIY\n\nEducation and behavioural change Policy options Circular business models\n\nSource: Based on EEA (2019).\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n48 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nFurthermore, the complexity of drivers in combination with \nglobalised production chains makes measures specifically \nchallenging to address. Global production chains often lead to \ncommunication gaps between producers and designers, making \nthe implementation of design-for-prevention ideas harder. \nThe complexity of supply chains also makes the exchange \nof information and data difficult, leading to poor traceability \nof\u00a0products.\n\nA crucial point in this regard is the lack of available data. More \ncomprehensive data sets would enable the creation of a robust \nevidence base and accelerate the implementation of indicators \nand targets. A number of indicators that could be used to \nmeasure textile waste prevention (when data are given) have \nbeen proposed by the Nordic Council (see Table 3.2). While \ndata on household expenditure on textile products are widely \navailable, data on the actual textile waste generated will most \nprobably only be accessible after 2025, following the national \nimplementation of the mandatory separate collection of \ntextile\u00a0waste.\n\n3.7 Conclusions and future prospects\n\n3.7.1 Key findings and policy options\n\nThe EU-27 plays a significant role in the textile industry. It \ninvolves large trade volumes and is counted the second largest \nexporter of textiles and clothing worldwide, after China. \nThe expenditure on clothing and home textiles of European \nhouseholds increased over the past two decades, while its \nshare in total household expenditure decreased; this, coupled \nwith increasing numbers of clothing items put on the market, \nindicates a fall in the price of garments. These low price levels \nare the result of the fast fashion industry producing low-quality \nitems very quickly. This and many other drivers of textile \nwaste have been identified in this study. The drivers of textile \nwaste are, however, closely linked to the opportunities for and \n\nTable 3.2 Proposed textile waste prevention indicators\n\nIndicator Unit\n\nTextile waste generation kg/capita/year\n\nNew textile products put on the market by weight kg/capita/year\n\nPurchase of second-hand textile products by weight kg/capita/year\n\nHousehold expenditure on textile products value/capita/year\n\nShare of second-hand products in total textile products put on the market (weight or value basis) %\n\nRatio (by weight) of exported second-hand products to total textile products put on the \ndomestic\u00a0market %\n\nHousehold expenditure on textile products per tonne of textile products put on the market value/tonne\n\nRepaired textile products number/capita/year\n\nSource: Based on Watson et al. (2013).\n\nbarriers to its prevention. Textile waste prevention is expected \nto overcome inherent fast fashion models, consumption \npatterns, established value chains and economic barriers. \nFor instance, it has been shown that the demand for fast \nfashion can be narrowed down to a specific age group, which \ndemonstrates which audience the awareness-raising campaigns \ncould be tailored to (WRAP, 2019). However, the complex and \nhighly globalised value chain and the lack of data on textile \nwaste remain the key challenges.\n\nThe assessment conducted in the context of this report mapped \nthe measures, indicators and targets addressing textile waste \nprevention within national waste prevention programmes. \nThe assessment revealed about 40 measures that specifically \naddress textile waste in Europe. By mapping the indicators \nand targets for textile waste prevention, a serious lack of such \nindicators and targets has been identified, which could drive \nfurther policy development in this emerging field towards \npreventing waste. The drivers of textile waste identified can, \nfor instance, be addressed through technical, social and policy \nframeworks, such as the Dutch circular textile programme \n2020-2025 or the Swedish VAT regulation on repair.\n\nBased on the analysis of waste prevention drivers and the \nmapping of existing measures, the following policy options exist \nfor reducing textile waste:\n\n\u2022 regulatory incentives enforcing durability standards \nand circular design requirements or the banning of \nunsold\u00a0goods;\n\n\u2022 stricter regulations for chemicals within the textile \nindustry increasing the longevity of textiles;\n\n\u2022 promotion of research and innovation to develop \ndurable and circular textiles and technological innovations \n(e.g. digital product passport for clothing; see example in \nBox 3.8);\n\f\nPreventing textile waste in\u00a0Europe\n\n49Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n\u2022 promotion of collaboration and exchange platforms \nbetween key stakeholders along the supply chain;\n\n\u2022 supporting actions for techno-infrastructural \ndevelopments for both collaborative business models and \nclosed material loops;\n\n\u2022 producer awareness campaigns on durability, repair \nand reuse (e.g. implementing repairability of clothing into \nproduct policy or establishing take-back systems);\n\n\u2022 establishment of an EPR scheme, potentially harmonised \nat EU level, placing responsibility on producers for their \nproducts from their conception to their end-of-life phase, \nwhile setting an incentive for eco-design and reducing the \ncost of waste generated;\n\n\u2022 economic incentives for consumers to use repair services \n(e.g. tax breaks) and green public procurement;\n\n\u2022 clothing label and certification programmes addressing \nlongevity of textiles and/or including the aspect of longevity \nin existing labels and certifications; \n\n\u2022 information for consumers about the environmental \nimpacts of their textiles through harmonised methods such \nas the EU's product environmental footprint;\n\n\u2022 cooperation among countries towards finding a common \nmethodology and a format for reporting textile waste \ncollection and reuse capacities.\n\n3.7.2 Future prospects\n\nRegarding the future development of the textile industry, the \nJoint Research Centre (JRC) developed a vision statement that, \nby 2025, the textiles and clothing industry would be a strategic \nEU industry sector providing innovative products that enable \nservices to be integrated and that the industry would operate \naccording to a circular economic model (Bontoux et al., 2017).\n\nThe current linear textile value chain, however, is vulnerable to \nunpredictable events. Its lack of resilience was clear during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, when consumer demand collapsed and \nthere were shortages of raw materials. This exacerbated the \nexisting social and environmental issues of the textile industry. \nThe difficulties related to the COVID-19 outbreak highlighted \nonce more the importance of transforming the textile value \nchain into a more resilient and environmentally friendly \nindustry. The implementation of circular economy principles in \nthe textile industry is a key future approach and requires the \nengagement of stakeholders at all stages along the value chain.\n\nTo achieve circularity of textiles (and meet the JRC's vision by \n2025) and, particularly, to foster textile waste prevention, will \n\nrequire policy, economic and societal stakeholders to join \nforces. The steps that can be undertaken within each group \nare outlined in Figure 3.5, involving collaborative business \nmodels at the business level, the promotion of longer use \nand reuse at the policy level or a change in consumption \nhabits at the societal level. The slow fashion trend, which \nstrives to slow down the consumption and production \nprocesses within the textile industry, already induces \nfashion brands to establish new business models (see \nFigure 3.5) and consumers to purchase clothes wisely and \nless often (ETC/WMGE, 2019). A comprehensive transition \ntowards a successful waste prevention, however, can \nonly be achieved when distinct policy measures are put in \nplace\u00a0too.\n\nOverall, the focus on waste prevention efforts in the \ntextile sector is currently rather low across Europe. A more \nsystematic approach in waste prevention policymaking is \nneeded, with concrete targets, supportive measures, and \nrobust data collection and exchange among the different \nstakeholders. However, the increasing importance of \nthe textile sector in EU policymaking is expected to drive \nchange at the national level in Europe, and the next \nversions of national waste prevention programmes are \nvery likely to focus on textile waste. The forthcoming EU \ntextile strategy, for instance, envisages proposing actions \nthat enable bringing the textile industry into the concept \nof the circular economy. It ought to consider sustainable \nproduction and lifestyles, the use of chemicals, future \ntextile waste collection and recycling in the EU Member \nStates and it furthermore seeks to address these through \nreuse and recycling targets (European Commission, 2021a). \nThese efforts will be accompanied by the forthcoming \nsustainable products initiative, which seeks to propose the \nnecessary changes in the EU legal framework (European \nCommission, 2021b).\n\nBox 3.8  Digital infrastructure for textiles in \nEstonia\n\nTEXRoad is developing a sector-specific interoperable \ndigital infrastructure. This will enable the distribution \nof fundamental textile data to key stakeholders (the \npublic sector, industry and academia). According to \nthe study 'Post-consumer textile circularity in the Baltic \ncountries',\tabout\t73\u00a0%\tof\tmaterials\tgoing\tinto\tthe\tglobal\t\nclothing system ends up in landfill being incinerated. \nTEXroad wants to change that, as a large part of these \ntextiles is still usable and could be reused, and another \ngood proportion of the textiles could be recycled into \nnew products. TEXroad believes that today's innovation \nvitally depends on data flows. \n\nFind out more: https://accelerateestonia.ee/project/\ncircular-textiles/ and https://texroad.org\n\nhttps://accelerateestonia.ee/project/circular-textiles/ and https://texroad.org\f\n\u00a9 Irene Sanfiel, Environment & Me/EEA\n\f\f\nProgress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention52\n\nAbbreviations\n\nEEA European Environment Agency\n\nEPR Extended producer responsibility\n\nGDP Gross domestic product\n\nREACH Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation)\n\nSDG Sustainable Development Goal\n\nVAT Value added tax\n\nWEEE Waste electrical and electronic equipment\n\nWFD Waste Framework Directive\n\f\n53Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nReferences\n\nAlhola, K., et al., 2018, 'Exploiting the potential of public \nprocurement: opportunities for circular economy',  \nJournal of Industrial Ecology 23(1), pp. 96-109.\n\nBarnes, L. and Lea-Greenwood, G., 2006, 'Fast fashioning the \nsupply chain: shaping the research agenda', Journal of Fashion \nMarketing and Management 10(3), pp. 259.\n\nBelleza, E. and Luukka, E., 2018, Svenska textilfl\u00f6den- textilfl\u00f6den \nfr\u00e5n v\u00e4lg\u00f6renhet och utvalda verksamheter, SMED Rapport No 2, \nSwedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute,  \nNorrk\u00f6ping, Sweden\n\nBeton, A., et al., 2014, Environmental improvement potential of \ntextiles (IMPRO Textiles), European Commission, Joint Research \nCentre and Institute for Prospective Technological Studies \n(https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2791/52624)  \naccessed 15 November 2021.\n\nBMU, 2019, Treasure not trash \u2014 Waste avoidance strategies \nand ideas, German Federal Ministry for the Environment, \nNature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, (https://www.\nbmu.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Pools/Broschueren/\nabfallvermeidung_wertschaetzen_statt_wegwerfen_en_\nbf.pdf) accessed 15 November 2021.\n\nBMU,\t2020,\t'Die\tObhutspflicht\tim\tKreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz\u00a0\u2014\t\nnovelle KrWG (\u00a7 23 Absatz 1 Satz 3, Absatz 2 Nummer 11, \u00a7 24 \nNummer 10, \u00a7 25 Absatz 1 Nummer 9 KrWG)', German Federal \nMinistry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear \nSafety (https://www.bmu.de/themen/wasser-abfall-boden/\nabfallwirtschaft/abfallpolitik/kreislaufwirtschaft/dieobhutspflicht-im-kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz)  \naccessed 30 June 2021.\n\nBontoux L, Boucher P and Scapolo F.

audience Citizens, economy\n\nType of measure Economic, voluntary, informative\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nOngoing\n\nShort description The repair guide 'Austria's clever repair search' offers citizens the opportunity to quickly \nand reliably find online a repair option for a used product in the area (either with a \nsuitable keyword or using the 12 different categories (e.g. clothing, electrical appliances, \nmachines and household appliances.). The list of companies found can then be narrowed \ndown geographically to individual districts. Every repair shop can register under certain \nrequirements free of charge at www.reparaturf\u00fchrer.at. The online platform is supported \nby the partners in the respective federal states and supported by the Ministry for Climate \nAction (BMK) and Austria Glas Recycling GmbH (ARA).\n\nIn addition, reference is made to the offer of a repair bonus. Federal states promote \nindividual repairs at regional companies. These repair subsidies are not an offer from the \nrepair guide, but were initiated and implemented directly by the federal states.\n\n2 Establishment of a stakeholder initiative with a focus on textiles and clothing\n\nTarget audience Administration, science, research and innovation, economy, non-governmental \norganisations (environmental and social)\n\nType of measure Voluntary, informative\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nOngoing\n\nShort description A stakeholder initiative with focus on textiles and clothing to exchange information/\nexperience and to promote circular economy and sustainable production was established. \nThe\tfirst\tdialogue\talready\ttook\tplace\ton\t15\u00a0October\t2021.\n\nThe aim of the first dialogue was to present current studies on textiles in the circular \neconomy, to discuss the scope for action and measures for the Austrian circular economy \nstrategy and to link up stakeholders along the entire value chain.\n\nFurthermore, there were very good experiences with previous stakeholder dialogues, which \nhave been carried out by BMK (Ministry for Climate Action) for several years in the area of \nwaste prevention (e.g. on food waste, reuse.)\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n61Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n3 Development of an Austrian circular economy strategy with a focus on textiles and clothing\n\nTarget audience Administration, science, research and innovation, economy, non-governmental \norganisations (environmental and social)\n\nType of measure Regulatory, economic, voluntary, informative, other\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nThe Austrian circular economy strategy should be available in 2022.\n\nShort description With the Green Deal and the new action plan for the circular economy, the EU Commission \nis also focusing on textiles and clothing. It is planning to develop a comprehensive EU \ntextile strategy with the aim of expanding the market for sustainable, environmentally \nfriendly, reusable and repairable textiles in Europe. Based on these EU requirements, \na circular economy strategy is also being developed in Austria, with a focus on textiles \nand clothing, among other things. The aim is to stimulate the transition to a sustainable, \nclimate-neutral, competitive, resource-efficient, circular textile economy and society. \nTherefore, the Federal Ministry for Climate Protection has conducted a study on incentives \nfor a sustainable and circular textile economy in Austria. The goal of this study is to obtain \nsuggestions on how supply and demand for environmentally friendly, circular and durable \ntextiles can be increased, sustainable production and behaviour patterns can be stimulated \nas well as a survey and estimation of the public procurement volume for textiles. The \nresults of the study provide input for the development of the textile focus and show the \nprocurement volume for textiles by public stakeholders in Austria, estimated at up to \nEUR\u00a0560\tmillion\tannually.\t\n\nThe goals of the transformation focus 'textiles and clothing' are:\n\n\u2022 extending the life and useful life of textiles;\n\n\u2022 promotion of circular business models;\n\n\u2022 increasing the collection, sorting and recycling of textiles.\n\nA2.2 Bulgaria\n\n1 Separate collection of second-hand clothes and textile waste from households\n\nTarget audience Households, municipalities\n\nType of measure Voluntary\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 2016\n\nShort description Several different private companies engaged in the import, sorting and pre-treatment of \nsecond-hand clothes and textile waste operate the separate collection systems for textiles \nintended for households.\n\nThese systems are on a voluntary basis after concluding contracts with municipalities. \nAt\u00a0present,\tthe\tmain\tmunicipalities\tin\tthe\tcountry\tare\tcovered,\tbut\tthere\tare\tno\tparticular\t\nrequirements and parameters of the systems. Separate collection is organised through \ntraditional kerbside containers for textile. The collected second-hand clothes and textile \nwastes are sold on the Bulgarian or foreign market by the companies themselves. Some of \nthe containers serve on behalf of the Bulgarian Red Cross (BRC). Of these, the second-hand \nclothes suitable for use are directed to the BRC crisis reserve or for donation to people \nin\u00a0need.\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n62 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nA2.3 Croatia\n\n1\t Social\tCollective\tHumana\tNova\t\u2014\tReuse\tof\twaste\u00a0textiles\n\nTarget audience Local community\n\nType of measure Economic\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\n1/5/2020-31/12/2020\n\nShort description The project aim was to collect and treat as much textile material as possible and repurpose \nit to make reusable textiles for industry in the form of industrial cloths with an indication \nof reuse.

During the project 1 tonne of textile was collected, out of which \n1000 protective masks and 300 bags were made.\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n63Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nA2.4 Cyprus\n\n1 Anakyklos Perivalontiki\n\nTarget audience Cyprus residents\n\nType of measure Voluntary/economic\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 2014\n\nShort description Anakyklos Perivalontiki operates as a green and social enterprise/company, focusing on \nthe collection and recycling of clothing, general fabric and fabric-related material. Though \nits primary goal is environmental sustainability through the recycling of clothes, fabrics, \ntextiles, etc., it also has broader environmental and social aims. The company is funded \nfrom private savings and personal loans, undertaken by five volunteers, its initial members.\nThe business employs 35 people in total, mainly from vulnerable groups (long-term \nunemployed). The revenues derives from:\n\n1. the sale of second-hand clothes in its four charity shops located in Cyprus' four main \ndistricts; and\n\n2. from the export of fabric and material to be resold or recycled and used as raw \nmaterial\u00a0abroad.\n\nThe project started initially with six collection banks/points in three municipalities and now \nthere are 415 collection points, covering the whole of Cyprus through 30 municipalities and \n125\tcommunities,\tcollecting\tso\tfar\tover\t6\u00a0000\ttonnes\tof\ttextiles.\n\nAs to its environmental actions, it has thus far led 126 activities for schools and 160 for the \nbroader public.\n\nAs to the societal activities of the business (i.e. offering free-of-charge clothes/fabric-related \nmaterial\tto\tthe\teconomically\tdisadvantaged)\tthese\taccount\tfor\t2\u00a0335\tpeople,\tin\ta\tpopulation\t\nof\t750\u00a0000,\tnot\tcounting\thome\tdeliveries\tand\tinstitutions.\tPerforms\tactions\tsuch\tas:\n\n\u2022 Sorting and offering free clothes to hundreds of people who need them, at the \nAnakyklos\u00a0stores.\n\n\u2022 Collection of clothes from dozens of social organisations and offer thousands of euros \nto buy food for people in need, covering expenses and providing breakfast for poor \nstudents and/or to support the social work of the organisations.\n\n\u2022 Offering some quantities of clothes to Cyprus Red Cross. \n\nA2.5 Czechia\n\n1 Municipal reuse centres\n\nTarget audience Public, citizens\n\nType of measure Regulatory, economic\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 01/01/2021 (unlimited)\n\nShort description Czechia supports the establishment of municipal reuse centres where citizens may bring \nthings for reuse. Things for reuse may also include clothes, footwear and household \ntextiles (e.g. Linens, blankets). Establishment of municipal reuse centres is supported \nthrough EU structural funds \u2014 Operational Programme Environment. Also from 1 January \n2021, the new Act on Waste came into force, which specifically states that a movable thing, \nwhich a person handed over to a location designated by a municipality and which can be \nused for its original purpose, in accordance with other legal regulations, has not become \nwaste, provided it has been handed over for reuse. \n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n64 Progress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\nA2.6 Finland\n\n1 Now, let's talk about textiles \u2014 Series of videos and blogs about textiles\n\nTarget audience Citizens\n\nType of measure Informative\n\nTime period for \nimplementation\n\nSince 2018\n\nShort description The campaign, implemented during 2018, aimed to bring the broad theme of the textile \ncircular economy to the attention of a wider audience. The aim was to promote a change \nin attitudes towards the consumption and recycling of textiles and to increase the value \nof textile products. The aim was to clarify for consumers the concept of waste textiles, \nrecycling and the possibilities for further processing. The presentation of the stakeholders \ninvolved in the different stages of the textile cycle and the broad base of cooperation was \nalso seen as a key message. The series was designed together between the Southwest \nFinland Waste Management, Turku University of Applied Sciences and Wallonia and was \nmade as part of the Telaketju pilot project funded by the Ministry of the Environment. The \nname of the blog and video series was chosen to be 'Now let's talk about textiles!'

The \nassignment should be carried out in cooperation with the Swedish Consumer Agency and the \nSwedish Chemicals Agency and the commission should include consumers' knowledge of the \nenvironmental and health impacts of textiles at every step of the value chain. \n\nInitially, an analysis of the current situation was carried out with the aim of identifying \nconsumers' knowledge of the environmental and health impact related to textiles and how \nconsumers act today, how they want and can act to reduce their environmental impact \nfrom the consumption of textiles. It also aimed to monitor the impact of the efforts over \ntime and to identify possible partners for cooperation.\n\nIn order to reach out broadly to selected target groups, the campaign's information \ninitiatives were divided into four tracks:\n\n1. low-intensity and long-term direct communication with consumers in their own digital \nchannels, via advertising and intermediary providers of information in digital channels;\n\n2. direct communication with consumers through targeted communication initiatives at \nselected areas, events and media initiatives ;\n\n3. development of information material and cooperation with stakeholders like \nmunicipalities, county administrative boards and regions ;\n\n4. collaboration with the industry to enable consumers to make more sustainable choices \nand to provide consumers with better information at the time of purchase.\n\nA joint visual identity, communication plan and a campaign name were developed to give \nthe three authorities a common voice. The information campaign was named Textilsmart. \nTwo primary information channels were set up for direct communication and ongoing \nadvertising to consumers: an Instagram account for concise, easily accessible facts and \nopportunities for dialogue, and a campaign site under Hall\u00e5 konsument where consumers \ncould find more detailed information. In addition, Textilsmart has implemented targeted \ncommunication initiatives and collaborations with stakeholders such as municipalities, \ncounty administrative boards and regions as well as with the industry to reach out and \nmeet consumers in their everyday lives.\n\nThree authorities have cooperated in the implementation of the information campaign \nTextilsmart. The campaign has also included collaborations with a variety of stakeholders \nto reach out widely to consumers in different arenas. A far-reaching cooperation has been \ncarried out with the National F/ACT Movement project to promote more sustainable textile \nconsumption. The collaboration between the Textilsmart campaign and the National  \nF/ACT Movement has involved joint press releases, Instagram posts and that the participating \nof f/activists (individuals who during the project period received training and creative \nchallenges in exchange for refraining from new consumption), shared Textilsmart's messages \nand materials and used #textilsmart in their own social media posts. The National  \nF/ACT Movement includes seven nodes/municipalities responsible for: (1) disseminating \ninformation locally, (2) coordinating inspiring meetings for individuals/f/activists and \n(3)\u00a0highlighting\tthe\tlocal\tbusiness\tcommunity.\tThe\tpurpose\twas\tto\tstimulate\tcollaborations\t\nand to test new solutions that contribute to a more sustainable textile consumption. \n\nIn\tNovember\t2020,\ta\tfollow-up\tconsumer\tsurvey\twas\tconducted\twith\t3\u00a0000\trespondents,\t\nwhich means that the answers can be considered as statistically reliable.

The purpose \nof Re:textile III (2018-2019) was to scale up the project to the national level in order to \ncontribute even more to reducing resource consumption and creating opportunities for a \nmore environmentally sustainable textile value chain, enabling new business models while \ndemonstrating economic viability in the models and, in the long run, facilitating consumers \nto choose more sustainable alternatives. Re:textile conveys knowledge, advice and practical \napplication in collaboration with companies in the fashion and textile industry. The aim of \nthe project was to help the industry with transition by creating good examples to inspire, \nconduct economic studies on scalability and profitability in circular business models. By \nincluding the consumer perspective in the pilot study of the F/ACT Movement initiative, \nRe:textile III has worked with an even broader system perspective to influence the textile \nand fashion industry to a circular transformation and more sustainable development.

We unite industry players and \ncreate a dynamic, strong COMMUNITY to reduce environmental impact at both national \nand international levels. Textile & Fashion 2030 is the platform that puts Sweden at the \nforefront when it comes to the development of the textile and fashion sector in moving \ntowards sustainability and a circular economy. Its aims are:\n\n\u2022 to promote collaboration, cooperation and efforts towards an environmentally \nsustainable value chain in the textiles sector;\n\n\u2022 to make research and development results available for environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment and provide a bridge between research and practice;\n\n\u2022 to promote sustainable business models and combine environmental benefits with \nbusiness benefits;\n\n\u2022 to strengthen the work of SMEs to achieve circular flow and environmentally \nsustainable\u00a0development;\n\n\u2022 to minimise negative environmental effects from production. \nIn this way, the platform also works to achieve the national environmental goals and the \nAgenda 2030 goals that affect textiles and fashion.\n\nThe platform, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders from business, academia, \ninstitutes and public organisations, will encourage and coordinate education, research and \ninnovation with the aim of supporting environmentally sustainable development. Areas \nof focus include developing new business models, freeing production and other activities \nfrom substances harmful to health and the environment, improving energy efficiency in the \nsector and, primarily, promoting a transition to a circular economy, i.e. models that result \nin an efficient cycle of materials rather than linear processes. The purpose is to create a \ncircular cycle for the textile and fashion sector.\n\nGoal\n\nTextile & Fashion 2030 will situate Sweden as a world-leading partner and role model in the \ncircular economy with minimal environmental impact in terms of textiles and fashion.\n\nWithin Textile & Fashion 2030, we intend to strengthen the positive forces already at \nwork and together ensure that the Swedish textile and fashion industry's contributions to \nmeeting the global goals of Agenda 2030 are realised.\n\nVision\n\nThe platform for sustainable fashion and sustainable textiles is an effective resource for \ncompanies' transition to a circular economy and, for the sector, a centre when it comes to \nknowledge and collaboration, thus making Sweden a leader in relation to the environment \nand sustainability.\n\nThere are a number of strategic target areas with measurable, related operational goals \nlinked to the platform's structure and activities that protect the platform's vision. \nWe offer skills development, activities and tools that measure the progress of your \nsustainability work to achieve desirable results and to meet the consumer of the future. \nThrough our work, Sweden is ACTING now and we are acting together.\n\f\f\nEuropean Environment Agency\n\nProgress towards preventing waste in Europe \u2014 the case of textile waste prevention\n\n2021 \u2014 72 pp. \u2014 21 x 29.7 cm\n\nISBN 978-92-9480-411-2\ndoi:10.2800/494502\n\nGetting in touch with the EU\n\nIn person\nAll over the European Union there are hundreds of Europe Direct information centres.

The outlook towards 2020 remains, however, uncertain since the examined past time series is short and the increase relates mostly to just one data point (2014-2016).\nFor further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.3 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2018\nThe Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) states that, by 2020, absolute and per capita waste generation should be in decline. A society that meets its needs while producing less waste is more resource efficient, with lower environmental risks from waste management. The total amount of waste generated, excluding major mineral wastes, is used as the indicator to track progress towards a reduction in waste generation. The amount of this waste in the EU increased by 5.1 % in absolute amounts and by 3.6 % per capita between 2010 and 2016. The key driver behind the increase in waste generation seems to be the increase in the generation of secondary waste, triggered by a move away from landfilling towards recycling and incineration. The prospects of waste generation declining by 2020 are uncertain as the increase in waste generation is associated mainly with only one data point (2014-2016) and because there are methodological uncertainties (short time series \u2014 only four data points \u2014 and some data collection improvements in waste statistics) related to the past trend. There is, however, a risk that waste generation continues to increase in line with economic growth. On the other hand, there is an expectation that the measures in the Circular Economy Package will contribute to a reduction in waste generation in the longer term.\nThe 7th EAP includes an objective that, by 2020, absolute waste and per capita waste generation are in decline and waste is managed safely as a resource (EU, 2013). The waste hierarchy is the central framework for EU and national waste policies. This hierarchy gives the highest priority to waste prevention, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery and finally disposal. Reducing the amount of waste generated means that there is less waste to manage and also, potentially, that the demand for material and energy resources and associated environmental impacts has been reduced (AIRS_PO2.1, 2018). This briefing examines the trends in waste generation by using the total amount of waste generated, excluding major mineral wastes, as an indicator. For terminology and rationale of choice, see the \u2018About the indicator\u2019 section at the end of the briefing.\nThe Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe contains several waste-related milestones to be met by 2020, including one that requires waste generated per capita to be in absolute decline (EC, 2011).\nWaste prevention and the use of waste as a resource is becoming increasingly important, not only in environmental policy but also in industrial and raw materials policy. In December 2015, the European Commission published \u2018Closing the loop \u2014 An EU action plan for the circular economy\u2019 (EC, 2015), otherwise known as the Circular Economy Package. Unlike the traditional linear take\u2013make\u2013consume\u2013dispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respect planetary boundaries by increasing the proportion of renewable or recyclable resources while reducing the consumption of raw materials. Approaches such as eco-design and sharing, reuse, repair and refurbishing will play a significant role in maintaining the utility of products and components, and reducing the generation of waste (EEA, 2016, 2017, 2018).\nThe Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008) obliges EU Member States to adopt and implement waste prevention programmes. The revised Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2018) strengthens this requirement but does not introduce binding quantified targets for waste prevention. A review of available programmes indicates that countries use a broad range of measures with a focus on information-based instruments and, to a lesser extent, regulatory and economic instruments. A total of 17 out of 27 waste prevention programmes analysed include quantitative targets (EEA, 2015).\nNote: The data were extracted on 12 October 2018. The 2016 data are Eurostat estimates.\nThe total amount of waste generated in the EU, excluding major mineral wastes, increased by 5.1 % between 2010 and 2016 (Figure 1)[1]. The total amount of waste, excluding major mineral wastes, increased by 6.9 % over the same period when Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey \u2014 the four other EEA member countries for which data are available \u2014 were added to the EU total (EEA calculations based on Eurostat, 2018a).\nIn 2016, the highest absolute levels of waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) in the EU were recorded for the water and waste sector, for households, and for the manufacturing sector.\nBetween 2010 and 2016, there were some shifts in waste generation between sectors in the EU. Most prominently, waste generated in the water and waste sector increased by 38 %, while in the energy and extraction sector it increased by 2 %. Over the same period, waste generation decreased by 6 % in the services, manufacturing and construction sectors and by 3 % in the agriculture, forestry and fishing, and households sectors.\nThe waste includes secondary waste, which is mainly generated in the \u2018water and waste sector\u2019. The increase in secondary waste seems to be the main factor in the increasing overall trend in waste generation in the 2010-2016 period. This waste is generated during the treatment of waste and comprises, for example, sorting residues, sludges and incineration ashes. More complex waste management such as recycling and incineration usually results in more secondary waste. The EU is moving away from landfilling of waste towards more recycling and incineration. For example, the share of landfilled waste (excluding major mineral wastes) decreased from 28 % to 24 % in the 2010-2016 period (EEA calculation based on Eurostat, 2018b). This development led to an increase in the amount of secondary waste generated, which increased from a share of 12 % of total waste in 2010 to 18 % in 2016, excluding major mineral wastes.\nThe overall improvements and the shifts between sectors are probably due to a combination of factors including efficiency improvements in production processes and management, and changes in the structure of the economy. The overall improvements and the shift between sectors may also be because of methodological changes in data collection and should therefore be interpreted with caution.\nIn conclusion, the overall amount of waste generated increased between 2010 and 2016. However, only four data points were used to assess the past trend \u2014 earlier data were available but were strongly influenced by adjustments in data collection methods and were therefore not used in this indicator. Methodological adjustments may have also influenced the four data points to some degree. Furthermore, the increase in waste generation is primarily associated with only one data point (2014-2016). As a result of these uncertainties, the outlook towards reducing waste generation within the period of the implementation of the 7th EAP (2014-2020) is also uncertain. There is nevertheless a risk that waste generation increases along with economic growth. On the other hand, measures in the Circular Economy Package and the waste prevention programmes in the EU Member States should contribute to a reduction in waste generation.\nIn 2016, the EU per capita generation of waste \u2014 excluding major mineral wastes \u2014 amounted to 1 783 kg. This is 63 kg more than in 2010; an increase of 3.7 % over the 2010-2016 period. When Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey (the four other EEA member countries for which data are available) are included in EU per capita waste generation, the trend over the 2010-2016 period remains similar, with an increase of 4.4 % (EEA calculations based on Eurostat, 2018a).\nFigure 2 shows that the majority of European countries generate between 1 and 2 tonnes of waste (excluding major mineral waste) per person per year. Between 2010 and 2016, half of the EU countries reduced their per capita waste generation, while the other half increased it. The high figures for Estonia are because of energy production based on oil shale (Eurostat, 2018c).\nNote: The data were extracted on 17 October 2018. For 2016, data for Albania, Greece and Ireland were not available and data for 2014 were used instead. Eurostat data estimates for 2016 were used for the EU-28\nThe long-term prospects for reducing the waste generated in the EU are uncertain. A shift to a circular economy, with increased reuse of goods and materials, has the potential to reduce waste generation. The waste prevention programmes adopted by the EU Member States, Iceland and Norway can be expected to take effect towards 2020. However, the effectiveness of many of the waste prevention measures in the programmes can currently not be assessed for the EU and Europe as a whole. The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015) includes a number of measures that aim to reduce waste generation beyond 2020. These include concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis \u2014 turning one industry\u2019s by-product into another industry\u2019s raw material \u2014 and economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electric and electronic equipment, and vehicles). The success of these measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for reducing waste generation.\nThis indicator is defined as the weight of waste generated per year, excluding major mineral wastes (mineral construction and demolition waste, other mineral waste, dredging spoils and soils). Although the indicator focuses mainly on non-mineral wastes, which represent approximately 35 % of the total waste generated in the EU, \u2018it is considered to reflect the general trend in waste generation more accurately and in a more comparable way than the generated total including mineral wastes\u2019 (Eurostat, 2018d). This exclusion enhances the quality of the indicator as the uncertainty over major mineral waste data and associated statistics (in particular construction and mining) is rather high, while for some waste streams (for example contaminated soils) the key aim is to remediate these waste streams rather than to count them as waste. The exclusion also enhances comparability across countries, as mineral waste accounts for very high quantities in some countries and for some economic activities, such as mining and construction.\nWaste generation data by economic sector are published by Eurostat every 2 years. These are grouped for the purpose of the indicator in the following way: agriculture; forestry and fishing; energy and extraction; water and waste; manufacturing; construction; services; and households.\nThe water and waste sector includes water collection, treatment and supply, sewerage and three waste sector categories (waste collection, treatment and disposal activities, materials recovery, remediation activities and other waste management services; and wholesale waste and scrap). The data, especially for the water and waste sector, include secondary waste, i.e. material that is the output of waste treatment (secondary waste) (Eurostat, 2018e). Progress in the (pre-) treatment of waste may result in an increase in generated waste in the indicator because waste is counted twice; as primary and as secondary waste.\nThe energy and extraction sector includes electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply plus non-mineral wastes from mining and quarrying. Manufacturing includes food, textiles, wood, paper, coke, chemicals, metals, electronics, transport equipment and other machinery.\nThe data used in this indicator are based on reporting according to the EU Waste Statistics Regulation (EU, 2002). The first reporting year was 2004 and data quality has been improving since then. In particular, during the 2004-2008 period, many countries implemented methodological changes in their data collection, including allocation of waste to sectors, reclassification from unspecific waste codes to more specific ones and exclusion of by-products from waste reporting. In 2010, a major revision of the Waste Statistics Regulation took effect, enabling a more precise calculation of the waste category \u2018waste excluding major mineral wastes\u2019 and the separate identification of secondary wastes. For all these reasons, the indicator in this briefing uses 2010 as a base year. It should be kept in mind that an analysis of trends that is based on four data points only (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016) is, nevertheless, rather uncertain.\n[1] According to the methodology used across this series of briefings (that supports the monitoring of the 7th EAP), a change of less than 3 % in the indicator value from the base year to the year with the latest available data is considered insignificant and the trend is assessed as being relatively stable. A change of more than 3 % represents a significant trend (improving or deteriorating depending on the case). Last year\u2019s trend was assessed as being stable, since there was an increase of less than 3 %, while this year\u2019s trend was judged as being deteriorating since the increase was 5.1 %, i.e. more than 3 %.\nEC, 2011, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2018Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe\u2019 (COM(2011) 571 final).\nEC, 2014, Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on statistics compiled pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 on waste statistics and their quality (COM(2014) 079 final).\nEC, 2015, Closing the loop \u2014 An EU action plan for the circular economy (COM(2015) 614 final) (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/index_en.htm) accessed 9 October 2018.\nEEA, 2015, Waste prevention in Europe \u2014 the status in 2014, EEA Report No 6/2015, European Environment Agency.\nEEA, 2016, Circular economy in Europe \u2014 Developing the knowledge base, EEA Report No 2/2016, European Environment Agency.\nEEA, 2017, Circular by design \u2014 Products in the circular economy, EEA Report No 6/2017, European Environment Agency.\nEEA, 2018, Waste prevention in Europe \u2013 policies, status and trends in reuse in 2017, EEA Report No. 4/2018, European Environment Agency.\nEU, 2002, Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics (OJ L 332, 9.12.2002, p. 1).\nEU, 2008, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3\u201330).\nEU, 2013, Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on a General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 \u2018Living well, within the limits of our planet\u2019, Annex A, paragraph 43(d) (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 171\u2013200).\nEU, 2018, Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, 2018/851 (OJ L 150, 14.06.2018, p. 109\u2013140).\nEurostat, 2018a, \u2018Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (env_wasgen)\u2019 (http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wasgen&lang=en) accessed 12 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018b, \u2018Treatment of waste by waste category, hazardousness and waste management operations (env_wastrt)\u2019 (http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wastrt&lang=en) accessed 18 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018c, \u2018Statistics explained \u2013 Waste statistics\u2019 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics) accessed 18 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018d, \u2018Eurostat metadata \u2014 Generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes by hazardousness (sdg_12_50)\u2019 (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/EN/sdg_12_50_esmsip2.htm) accessed 18 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018e, \u2018Eurostat metadata \u2014 Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (env_wasgen)\u2019 (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/env_wasgt_esms.htm) accessed 18 October 2018.\nAIRS briefings\nAIRS_PO2.1, 2018, Resource efficiency.\nEnvironmental indicator report 2018 \u2013 In support to the monitoring of the 7th Environment Action Programme, EEA report No19/2018, European Environment Agency\n29 Nov 2017 - Waste generation\n09 Dec 2016 - Waste generation\n2010-2020\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2018/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/waste-generation or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 11:12 AM\nFiled under: waste generation waste prevention waste recycling total waste\nFiled under: waste generation, waste prevention, waste, recycling, total waste\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others"]}
