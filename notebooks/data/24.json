These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. Emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) and international shipping are not included. Every year, the EEA coordinates the ESD review of Member States\u2019 greenhouse gas inventories, so that the European Commission can determine compliance with the annual ESD targets on the basis of accurate, reliable and verified emission data.

The 2015 and 2016 ESD emissions are based on the 28 final review reports of the annual ESD review 2017 and 2018. These data correspond to the values which will be used by the Commission to determine Member States\u2019 compliance under the ESD.\nFor 2017 ESD emissions, the data set is based on Member States\u2019 submissions of \u201capproximated inventories\u201d of GHG emissions, together with the ETS verified emissions mentioned above.\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.
