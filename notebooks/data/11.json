They are known as \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 as they are extremely persistent in our environment and bodies. They can lead to health problems such as liver damage, thyroid disease, obesity, fertility issues and cancer. Please consult our briefing on Emerging chemical risks in Europe \u2013 PFAS for further information.\nThe EU\u2019s Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is also working on PFAS. HBM4EU is a joint effort of 30 countries, the EEA and the European Commission, co-funded under Horizon 2020. Running from 2017 to 2021, HBM4EU generates knowledge to inform the safe management of chemicals and, thus, protect human health in Europe. You can watch the introductory HBM4EU video here or download a short overview of the project, entitled HBM4EU in brief.\nHBM4EU coordinates and promotes human biomonitoring in Europe, and is able to provide stronger evidence of the real exposure of citizens to chemicals. In addition, the project provides a robust interpretation of human biomonitoring data and the possible impact of chemical exposure on human health, using the most up to date scientific tools.\nFor more information on the PFAS work being developed under HBM4EU, please check its substance webpage. In this webpage, you can find out what products PFAS are used in, what substances are included in the group, their hazardous properties, human-related exposure and the policy questions that HBM4EU will answer with the research being developed.\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/faq/what-are-pfas-and-how or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 04:56 PM\nFiled under: Environment and health\nFiled under: Environment and health\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "ETC/WMGE Report 9/2021: Fluorinated polymers in a low carbon, circular and toxic-free economy21 Dec 2021\nFluorinated polymers are used in a variety of applications providing benefits to the society, but at the same time also causing risks of irreversible pollution and impacts on the environment and human health in different stages of the lifecycle.

Bart Ullstein (BEC) provided editorial support. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 2 \n\nExecutive summary \n\nThe aim of this report is to identify potential impacts of fluorinated polymers (FPs) along their lifecycles in \na low carbon, circular and toxic-free economy, which could be relevant to consider in future assessments. \n\nFluorinated polymers are defined as polymers made up of one or several types of monomer blocks (also \ncalled repeat units), which contain carbon-fluorine bonds in their backbones and/or side chains. According \nto the European Chemicals Agency\u2019s (ECHA) definition, a polymer has at least three monomers. \nFluorinated polymers cover a wide range of chemistries, which may be fully fluorinated (per-fluorinated) \nor partially fluorinated (poly-fluorinated) polymers, which can also contain chlorine or bromine. \nFluorinated elastomers are a special type of fluorinated polymers which have rubber-like properties. \n\nFluorinated polymers are used for a variety of purposes in transport, the chemicals industry, power \ngeneration, electronics, wire-insulation, coatings, cookware, textiles and cosmetics due to their special \nproperties of being resistant to abrasion, heat and chemical attack, and provide low friction. They are \nincreasingly used in renewable energy applications. In this report the following fluorinated polymers were \nselected for further analysis: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which makes up for more than half the \nmarket; polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF), the use of which is the fastest growing among fluorinated polymers \nworldwide; perfluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), an example of a copolymer; per- and polyfluorinated \npolyethers (PFPE), used in coatings for food contact paper, glass and used as machine oils; and fluorinated \nsidechain acrylate polymers, an example of fluorinated sidechain polymers used as coatings and sizing \nagents for textiles and food contact paper. \n\nThere is a lack of official data on the tonnages produced and consumed in the EU, but according to industry \nsources about 51 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers are produced in EU each year (PlasticsEurope, 2018) \nand 320 000 tonnes globally (AGC, 2020). Even if these amounts are small compared to total amounts of \nplastics in Europe, about 62 million tonnes of which are produced annually in Europe (PlasticsEurope, \n2019), the potential impacts of fluorinated polymers along their lifecycles may be relevant to the success \nof EU policies and strategies set out in the European Green Deal and the New Circular Action Plan, such as \nthe EU chemicals strategy, the Zero Pollution Ambition for toxic-free environment and the EU plastic \nstrategy. \n\nThe main focus of this report is on exploring lifecycle stages and emissions/impacts for which there seem \nto be significant knowledge gaps. These were found to be on climate-change impacts from greenhouse \ngases (GHG), pollution from ozone-depleting substances (ODS), both of which affect Earth systems and \nsubsequently human and environmental health, and on circular economy (CE) elements related to \nrecycling processes and rates for GHG and ODS, emissions from feedstocks, by-products and thermal \ndegradation products in the production/manufacturing and end-of-life phases. Impacts from \nmanufacturing products using fluorinated polymers are not assessed and only a few examples are \npresented. Areas described in less detail include raw material extraction; the use phase; and human health \nimpacts of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which have been studied in more detail \nelsewhere. The report is mainly based on a qualitative analysis supported by some of limited quantitative \ndata available in open literature and patents. \n\nThe main observations are as follows: \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\nRaw material extraction \u2022 The fluorine in fluorinated polymers comes from a mineral fluorspar, also called \nfluorite, the mineral form of calcium fluoride (CaF2) which is listed as a critical resource \non the European Commission\u2019s Critical Raw Material list due to high global supply risk. \n\n\u2022 A future potential resource could be from recycling of fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) \ngenerated as by-product from the fertiliser industry, and from capturing fluoride by \nadding calcium during incineration of PFAS, thereby turning it into CaF2. \n\nProduction of fluorinated \npolymers \n\nEnvironmental and human health impacts: \n\nRisks of feedstock, synthesis by-products and production aids. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 3 \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\n\u2022 Feedstock chemicals of fluorinated polymers can be potent GHG and ODS, which harm \nEarth systems and thereby people, biota and the environment. An example is \nchlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), which is a major feedstock in PTFE production. \nOzone-depleting substances cause health risks by degrading the ozone layer, leading \nto an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and thereby an increase in the rate of \nskin cancer (melanomas), cataracts and crop loses. Greenhouse gases are risks to \nhealth by disrupting the climate, leading to more frequent floods, heat waves, fires \nand failed harvests. Climate change also destabilises ecosystems and increases the \nacidity of the oceans, causing death of coral reef ecosystems amongst others. \n\n\u2022 Feedstock chemicals, monomers and oligomers of fluorinated polymers can harm \nworkers and people during use. Chloroform (CHCl3), for example, is a substance of \nvery high concern (a carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction [CMR] \nsubstance); tetrafluoroethylene shows clear signs of being a carcinogen in rats; and \nfluorinated oligomers are taken up on inhalation, bioaccumulate and form toxic \ndegradation products. \n\n\u2022 Production aids such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other PFAS used as \ndispersion agents in the synthesis of fluorinated polymers have caused diseases in \nworkers. They have furthermore contaminated air, soil, surface and drinking water, \nand food production around production sites with severe consequences for the \nsurrounding communities. The pollution has also spread globally and accumulated in \ntop predators, such as fish, seals, whales and humans. \n\nEmission routes from production to the environment \n\n\u2022 Volatile non-ionic and ionic PFAS are used and formed during fluorinated polymer \nproduction and manufacturing. Scrubbers, which can capture very volatile non-ionic \nPFAS, are only known to be in place in a few cases. \n\n\u2022 Emissions of PFAS from industrial production of fluorinated polymer sites occur \nthrough air, wastewater and production wastes. Examples include production aids \nsuch as PFOA and GenX1, released with from fluoropolymer production plants in, for \nexample, the Netherlands, Italy and the United States; and synthesis byproducts/impurities/degradation products such as fluorinated ethers in the United \nStates. \n\n\u2022 Information and data lack on how of production waste is managed in Europe. In the \nUnited States, waste disposed of in landfills has caused contamination of the \nsurrounding areas. \n\nRegulatory aspects \n\n\u2022 Feedstock chemicals, and to some extent intermediates, are subject to registration \nunder EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \nregulation (REACH) for annual uses above 1 tonne per substance per application. \n\n\u2022 Some feedstocks and production aids are classified as substances of very high concern \n(SVHCs) under REACH and are subject to restriction. \n\n\u2022 Some aggregated information on emissions of fluorinated gases (F-gases) to air and of \nperfluorinated carbons (PFCs) to air, water and soil are covered by the European \nPollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and have legal reporting obligations. \nOnly few industries producing, using or handling fluorinated polymer wastes are, \nhowever, required to report, and the reporting on lifecycle emissions from fluorinated \npolymers is limited. \n\n\u2022 The most important hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and PFCs as well as some fluorinated \nethers are covered by the EU F-gas Regulation and the Kigali Amendment of the \nMontreal Protocol on ODS, with reporting obligations for their production and uses. \nThe focus lies, however, on gases used in refrigeration, air conditioning and heating \nand foam-blowing applications. So far, however, reporting is only required for one Fgas by-product from fluoropolymer production, trifluoromethane (HFC-23). \n\nUse phase \n\n(Note: exposure has not been \nreviewed/described exhaustively \nin this report) \n\nFluorinated polymers are used in a wide range of applications, typically as part of a \ncomponent or a coating. \n\nExposure of workers, professionals and consumers is highly application specific. Examples \nof exposure routes include: \n\n\u2022 inhalation (volatiles/aerosols/dust) during manufacturing, heating or spaying of \nfluorinated polymers; \n\n \n1 A trademark name for a synthetic, short-chain organofluorine chemical compound, HFPO-DA (hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer \n\nacid) \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 4 \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\n\u2022 direct human exposure from food-contact materials (PFAS in food-contact materials \ncan migrate into food); \n\n\u2022 dermal contact \u2013 textiles, cosmetics/personal care products, lubricants, oils, waxes, \nand during occupational use, etc.; \n\n\u2022 release to the environment: \n\no microplastics can be released from fluorinated polymers either directly into the \nenvironment due to intentional use in products, or indirectly after physical \ndegradation of macro-sized fluorinated polymers in products or mismanaged \nwaste; \n\no release of ionic and non-ionic PFAS from fluorinated polymers from coatings of, for \nexample, textiles, food-contact materials, electronics, medical utensils, building \nmaterials, etc. \n\nRegulatory aspects \n\n\u2022 Fluorinated polymers are not regulated for most uses and products.  \n\n\u2022 In plastic food-contact materials, monomers, PFAS production aids and processing \nrequirements of the fluoropolymers are authorised for use by the EU, and have specific \nand total migration-limit values. For other non-harmonised food-contact materials, \nsuch as paper and board, fluorinated polymers and other chemicals are not specifically \nregulated by EU law \u2013 there are no authorisation processes or limit values \u2013 but the \noverall framework regulation requires chemicals not to migrate in amounts harmful to \nhuman health. \n\n\u2022 In medical utensils, fluorinated polymers are authorised with some regulation under \nthe EU Medical Devices Regulation. In cosmetic products, fluorinated polymers are \nregulated under EU Cosmetics Products Regulation.   \n\nEnd-of-life phase General: \n\n\u2022 Studies on emissions from the end-of-life phase are scarce and hardly exist for real-life \nconditions. This is the case both for managing wastes and thermal decomposition \nunder controlled conditions (incineration) and uncontrolled conditions, such as the \nsmoldering of electronics to strip metals. \n\n\u2022 Recovery of fluorinated polymers is made difficult by their widespread use in many \napplications ranging from liquids through integral parts of wires and electronics to \ncoatings on a variety of materials, such as paper, wood, glass, stone, metal and plastic. \n\n\u2022 There is very limited information on recycling, though process scrap is recycled to some \nextent. Some recycling of hydrogen fluoride (HF) may occur in the production phase of \nfertilisers. \n\n\u2022 Chemical recycling could potentially depolymerise fluorinated polymers into \nmonomers and subsequently into new polymers. Currently only one plant in Germany \nhas demonstrated this, but has a small capacity. \n\n\u2022 The possibility of thermally degrading fluorinated polymers is currently being \ndemonstrated for PFAS (PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]) in cement \nkilns, by use of calcium as a catalyst and fluoride as a scavenger, by the formation of \nCaF2 captured in the cement.  \n\n\u2022 Emissions from municipal wastewater treatment plants occur for perfluorinated acids \nand other ionic PFAS, as well as non-ionic PFAS such as fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), \nthrough water, air and sludge. Sources used and degraded PFAS from households and \nsmall industries. Very limited data exist on emissions from fluorinated polymers of \nparticularly persistent and mobile (PM) volatile PFAS, such as FTOHs and F-gases; \nfluorinated polymers in sludge; and for water soluble persistent and mobile PFAS \nreleased from the fluorinated polymers. \n\nRegulatory aspects: \n\n\u2022 Waste handling and related emissions are poorly documented for products ending up \noutside Europe. This remains relevant for Europe both because PFAS pollution spreads \nglobally and because of Europeans\u2019 responsibility to manage their wastes safely. There \nare also concerns related to human health about the potential formation of GHG and \nODS which can destabilise Earth systems, and toxic PFAS accumulating in food, biota \nand water systems. \n\n\u2022 Due to a lack of information on the composition of production wastes, it is generally \nnot possible to assess if they should be classified as hazardous wastes. Similarly, the \nrecovery of materials or the safe disposal of wastes is limited by a lack of clarity about \nwhat types of fluorinated polymers and levels of contaminants in products should be \ntreated as hazardous wastes. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 5 \n\nLifecycle phase Key Findings \n\nEnvironmental and human health impacts: \n\nIncineration: \n\n\u2022 Emissions depend on incineration conditions, which can lead to the formation of \ntrifluoroacetic acid (TFA), corrosive HF formed and released at temperatures below \n1 100 \u00b0C, and other volatile fluorinated gases, including oligomers released at lower \ntemperatures. In non-controlled conditions, fluorinated polymers may degrade \nthermally to form a variety of volatile and ionic/water-soluble PFAS and small particles. \nThermal degradation of PTFE starts at relatively low temperatures of less than 500 \u00b0C \nand forms many fluorinated products such as the highly persistent and mobile TFA. \nOther fluorinated polymers, including PFPE, start degrading at temperatures of around \n230 \u00b0C. \n\n\u2022 Several of the thermally-formed fluorinated substances have an environmental effect \nin terms of global warming potential (GWP). \n\nLandfilling: \n\n\u2022 In landfill conditions, end-of-life products containing fluorinated polymers, such as \ntextiles, carpets and some furniture, can degrade into PFAS which may then be \nreleased in landfill leachate decades after disposal. As a result, even closed landfills \nmay generate leachates that need to be treated. Only limited details of PFAS \nconcentrations in leachate were available in the literature, particularly for Europe, and \nthere was not much information on release mechanism and the fate of released \nsubstances.  \n\nDischarge from wastewater treatment plants: \n\n\u2022 Little information is available on emissions of volatile PFAS from wastewater treatment \nplants or on the management of sludge and effluents from wastewater treatment \nplants. \n\n \n\nOverall, impacts along selected fluorinated polymer lifecycles were analysed for this report in the light of \nEU policies and strategies on the CE, resource efficiency and raw materials, the low-carbon economy and \nzero-pollution ambitions for a toxic-free environment. Potential impacts that support and conflict with EU \nstrategies were identified below. \n\nStrategy, policy Potential benefits Potential risks \n\nCircular economy High durability, longevity, \nminiaturisation of products (less waste) \n\nAlthough fluorspar is on the EU\u2019s list of \ncritical raw materials, there is almost no \ninformation on recycling or recycling \nrates. Fluorinated polymers are often \nintegrated in components which make \nthem difficult to recycle. \n\nLow-carbon economy Use in renewable energy applications, \nreduced energy need (lighter vehicles, \netc.) \n\nRaw materials with greenhouse potential \nare used in production processes and are \nlikely to form when heated/incinerated \nat temperatures below that at which \nthey mineralise fully. \n\nZero Pollution Ambition/ toxic-free \nenvironment \n\nLongevity may avoid the need for new \nproducts due to wear \n\nUse of chemicals of concern, including \nPFAS, organochlorines and heavy metals, \nwill in practice lead to emissions and \nhence to risks during their production, \nuse and at end-of-life phases. The risks \nmay stem from either the substances \nthemselves or their by-products and \ndegradation products, both of which may \naccumulate and cause long-term, \nirreversible pollution and impact \nhumans, biota, and the wider \nenvironment. \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 6 \n\nIn summary, fluorinated polymers may lead to various severe and irreversible environmental and humanhealth impacts along their lifecycles and conflict with CE goals due to limited recycling options. \nNonetheless several uses of fluorinated polymers may until non-fluorinated alternatives have been \nidentified/developed, be needed in renewable energy solutions, which supports the European aim of \nbecoming a low-carbon economy. Likewise, fluorinated polymers may for now be needed for human \nhealth to deliver clean drinking water and in medical devices. Within the overall process of risk governance, \nthere are different options for implementing the concept of essential use. There is a need to \nunambiguously define criteria or considerations for essential use to enable the application of the concept \nin decision-making processes. \n\nWith forthcoming EU legislative initiatives on PFAS and discussions of reopening the REACH regulation (EC, \n2020d), there may be opportunities to better address the costs and risks to human and environmental \nhealth of fluorinated polymers along their lifecycles. Governance options include addressing fluorinated \npolymers separately as polymers of concern as part of the discussion on the reopening of REACH or \naddressing them through REACH restrictions to phase-out uses which are non-essential to the functioning \nof society and health, but allow currently essential ones while alternatives to PFAS are being developed. \n\nKnowledge gaps identified in the study include: \n\n\u2022 studies/research/monitoring on which substances are emitted from what activities \u2013 production, \nthe manufacture of products, incineration/thermal degradation/ineffective capturing of PFAS \nemitted from wastewater treatment etc.; \n\n\u2022 research and demonstrations of potential technologies for recycling fluorinated polymers from \nproduction waste and from end-of-life products; \n\n\u2022 a broad in-depth analysis of the benefits and risks associated with the use of fluorinated polymers \nin different applications. This calls for the development of a framework including criteria for the \ncategorisation of different applications as essential or non-essential. This will require the \ninvolvement of a wide range of experts and well-informed stakeholders from all aspects of value \nchains; \n\n\u2022 research and development on alternatives so that fluorinated polymers can be replaced by \nproducts with fewer negative impacts on the environment and human health. Work should also \ninclude information on the benefits and risks related to potential replacements; \n\n\u2022 labelling products containing fluorinated polymers \u2013 this is especially important for waste \nmanagement to ensure suitable management of end-of-life products; \n\n\u2022 awareness raising among product designers of the importance of material choices. In future, the \nreplacement of fluorinated polymers may create a market value for products with lower \nenvironmental footprints. Safe and sustainable by design (SSBD) criteria could ensure that \nchemicals of concern, as identified by EU\u2019s REACH regulation and the European Commission\u2019s \nchemical strategy for sustainability for a toxic-free environment, including PFAS, are avoided in \nthe design of chemicals, materials, processes and products. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 7 \n\n1 Introduction \n\nMain authors: Margareta Wahlstr\u00f6m and Xenia Trier \n\n1.1 Background and scope \n\nThe New Circular Economy Action Plan (EC, 2020a), one of main constituents of the European Green Deal \n(EC, 2019), includes \u201cmaking sustainable products as a norm in Europe\u201d as a key measure. It is built on the \nEU\u2019s previously published 2015 Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) and the 2018 Circular Economy \nPackage, including the EU Strategy on Plastics in a Circular Economy (EC, 2018). The European Green Deal \nas well as the CEAP have a strong focus on EU Climate Strategies (EC, 2021a) for a Low Carbon Economy. \n\nThe European Green Deal mentions the Zero-Pollution Ambition for a toxic-free environment which is a \nfollow-up action to the EU strategy for toxic-free environment mentioned in the 7th Environment Action \nPlan (7EAP). The Zero-Pollution Ambition (EC, 2021b) particularly addresses the need to rapidly address \nthe risk posed by hazardous chemicals and, more specifically, very persistent chemicals, encourage \ninitiatives that ensure that products are designed to be safe \u2013 free from hazardous chemicals \u2013 and \ncircular/sustainable by design and support actions for clean material loops. On 14 October 2020, the \nEuropean Commission published the Chemicals strategy for sustainability towards a toxic-free future (CSS) \nand set actions for substances of concern, including increased measures to prevent the use of the most \nharmful chemicals (EC, 2020d). \n\nMember States and the ECHA evaluate chemicals and Agency publishes candidate lists for substances of \nvery high concern (SVHC2) for authorisation. The Agency\u00b4s 2018 substitution strategy (European Chemicals \nAgency, 2018) promotes substitution of safer chemicals in the EU. Special attention should be given to the \nEU persistent organic pollutants (POPs) regulation (No 2019/1021 replacing 850/2004) which requires that \nwastes containing substances listed in its annexes, such as PFOS and PFOA, and exceeding specific \nconcentration limits need to be destroyed and not re-circulated in new products. \n\nThis study on fluorinated polymers in low-carbon, circular and toxic-free economies is linked to the \nfollowing policies: \n\n- EU policies on plastics closing the loop of product lifecycles by keeping the value of plastics in the \neconomy and minimising waste; \n\n- the climate strategies on GHG promoting action to reduce these with particular focus on \nfluorinated gases with high global warming effect; and \n\n- the strategy for a toxic-free environment with specific focus on SVHC such as PFAS used in the \nproduction of fluorinated polymers. Identification of toxic substances is of great importance so \nthat they can be phased out from society. \n\nSeveral restrictions and initiatives for PFAS have been included in the REACH and persistent POPs \nlegislation. A timeline for restrictions and initiatives for PFAS in these regulations and legislation is shown \nin Figure 1.1. \n\n \n2 defined in the REACH regulation as substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), very persistent and very \n\nbioaccumulative (vPvB) or have other characteristics of equivalent concern, such as endocrine disrupting, neurotoxic properties \nor are persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 8 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.

The lifecycle for fluorinated polymers is illustrated in Figure 1.2. \n\nThe report focusses on two areas of the fluorinated polymer lifecycle that previously have received less \nattention. \n\n1. Releases of GHG and ODS during the production, manufacture and incineration at the end of life \nof fluorinated polymers. This includes chemicals that are used, present as impurities, by-products \nformed or environmentally formed degradation products. \n\n2. The extent to which fluorinated polymers could be integrated into the CE. Along their lifecycles, \nimpacts related to climate change, ozone-depletion and environmental and human health are \nevaluated. The focus is on fluorinated chemicals which are GHG such as F-gases, ODS and toxic \nPFAS. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 9 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. The lifecycle of fluorinated polymers from feedstock extraction to end of life. \n\nSource: EEA and ETC/WMGE \n\n1.2 Methodology \n\nFor the analysis of lifecycle impacts from fluorinated polymers, the work was divided into the following \nsubtasks. \n\n1. Description of the current status: description of fluorinated polymer flows and current lifecycles \n(management), including amounts, products, markets. Focus is on Europe. Selection of key flows \nfor further analysis. \n\n2. Value chain analysis: identification and analysis of releases from different lifecycle phases with a \nspecial focus on ODS and GWP, and toxic chemicals used in their production. \n\n3. Description of the end-of-life phase: management options for recycling potential and toxic \nemissions for key streams, generated rejects and impurities of concern. \n\n4. Assessment of impacts in the light of EU policies and strategies. \n5. Recommendations for risk governance. \n6. Analysis of knowledge gaps. \n\nThe work is based on a literature survey of recently published reports and selected peer-reviewed articles, \nespecially those on the release and emissions from the production and end-of-life phases of fluorinated \npolymers\u2019 lifecycles. The main databases used for the literature survey were Scopus and Science Direct. In \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 10 \n\naddition, other, for example grey, literature was referred to where relevant. Market surveys by BCC \nResearch, Frost and Sullivan, Plastic Europe and WOODS on fluorinated polymers were looked into. Patents \ndescribing the synthesis of fluorinated monomers and polymers were also used as a source for production \npathways, intermediates and by-products. For the production/synthesis of fluorinated polymers and of \ntheir thermal degradation/ incineration, primary literature was sought in the domain of material sciences. \nThe impacts of PFAS on human and environmental health has been extensively reported in literature, \nreviews and reports from EU funded, Nordic or national projects and therefore this study mainly makes \nreferences to these. \n\nThe study was carried out as joint work with experts from two European Topic Centres (ETCs). The \nfollowing organizations participated in the work: \n\n- ETC/WMGE Waste and Materials in a Green Economy \u2013 VTT, VITO; \n- ETC/CME Climate Change Mitigation and Energy \u2013 NILU, \u00d6ko-Recherche, RIVM. \n\nFurthermore, Toke Winther from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency and a member of the \nEuropean Chemicals Agency PFAS working group followed the work, shared information from previous \nworks on the topic and provided valuable comments on findings. The draft report was also sent to selected \nexperts for review and feedback on the content and conclusions before publication. \n\nThe work made use of the in-house EEA and ETC expertise on reporting and policies on F-gases, ODS and \nindustrial emissions (ETC/CME) and waste management policies, non-toxicity policies and CE \n(ETC/WMGE). The work also was built on the following EEA/ETC reports: \n\n- 2019 ETC/WMGE report Plastics in Textiles, and relevant references on plastics in a CE; \n- 2019 EEA web-briefing Emerging risks of PFAS in Europe; \n- 2021 EEA web-briefing Safe and Sustainable by Design; \n- EEA reports yearly on the production, import, export and destruction of fluorinated GHG (3) and \n\nODS (4). \n\n1.3  Structure of report \n\nThis report consists of nine chapters (Figure 1.3): \n\nChapter 2 sets the scene for the study; it defines the fluorinated polymers selected for the study, their \nmain application areas and their key properties. Furthermore, it gives a short summary of the global \namounts of fluorinated polymers produced. \n\nChapter 3 presents information on the origin of fluorspar used for production of fluorinated polymers and \ninformation on the environmental impacts of mining. \n\nChapter 4 describes emissions to air, water and soil during production. It also gives information on the \nglobal warming potential and ozone-depleting potential of chemicals used in syntheses and \npolymerisation. \n\nChapter 5 gives examples of emissions and exposure routes related to the use of a few consumer products \ncontaining fluorinated polymers. Textiles, food-contact materials and cosmetics were chosen as examples. \n\nChapter 6 focusses on emissions/releases from different end-of-life options for products containing \nfluorinated polymers. Technologies for recycling options of process scraps are also reviewed. \n\n \n3 https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/fluorinated-greenhouse-gases-2020 \n4 https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/ozone-depleting-substances-2019 \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 11 \n\nChapter 7 analyses the benefits and challenges at different stages of the fluorinated polymer lifecycle in \nlight of EU strategies and policies for circular and low carbon economies and non-toxicity. It also includes \nan example of replacements for fluorinated polymers in one application. \n\nChapter 8 presents an approach to risk governance. \n\nChapter 9 summarises knowledge gaps along the fluorinated polymer lifecycle identified in previous \nchapters. \n\nAppendix A presents data on global warming and ozone-depleting potential of substances linked to \nfluorinated polymer production. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3.

This definition rules out, for instance, fluorosilicones, \nfluoroacrylate polymers and fluoropolyethers which also containing silicon and oxygen in the polymer \nbackbone, and therefore they are not often referred to as fluoropolymers (Smith Jr. et al., 2014; Russell et \nal., 2008). \n\nFluorinated polymers, on the other hand, include both: polymers containing at least one type of monomer \nunit with fluorine in it or which have a hydrocarbon backbone to which fluorinated sidechains are attached. \n\nThe term used in this report is fluorinated polymer which includes many types of fully (per-) or partially \n(poly-) fluorinated polymers including elastomers (rubbers), which also may contain chlorine (Gardiner, \n2015). At times, some fluorinated polymers are referred to as perfluoropolymers to emphasise their fully \nfluorinated composition compared to partially (poly-) fluorinated compounds (McKeen, 2017). Fluorinated \npolymers which contain a minimum of one CF2 \u2013 unit in its monomers or attached to its sidechains are per- \nand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (OECD, 2018). \n\nFigure 2.1 shows structures of fluorinated polymers, divided into fluoropolymers, where the carbon \nbackbone is fluorinated, and fluorinated sidechain polymers, where the fluorinated sidechains are \nattached to a hydrocarbon backbone. The simplest form of a fluoropolymers is the homopolymer which \nonly has one type of fluoro monomer (also called repeat units) of which there are n numbers (shown as \nan orange circle in the figure). When several types of fluoromonomers are present \u2013 shown as orange \ncircles and triangles in the figure \u2013 it is called a copolymer (Naka, 2014). At the end of the homopolymer \nand copolymer there are two end groups, A and B which may be chemically different or the same type, \nwhich can be used to control the solubility. Fluorinated sidechain polymers are also shown in the figure \nand consist of a hydrocarbon backbone (shown as green pentagons and hexagons n the figure), with \nattached poly- or perfluorinated sidechains shown as orange squares. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 13 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Structures of fluorinated polymers consisting of fluoropolymers (homopolymers, copolymers) and \nfluorinated side-chain polymers. \n\nSymbols , ,  are fluorinated monomer units, A and B describe end groups that help to control solubility of the \npolymers. Symbols   and  are hydrocarbon monomer units, n, m, and p are number of monomer units, also called \nrepeat units. \n\nSource: ETC/WMGE \n\nPolymers are not universally defined in terms of how many repeat units they should contain to qualify \nas polymers but rather polymers in terms of their material properties. In polymer and material sciences, \nwhere polymers, for instance, are described as \u201c\u2026 a substance composed of a molecule of high molecular \nweight (generally more than ten thousand). This is because polymers having a high molecular weight more \nthan ten thousand show polymer-like properties such as film and fibre forming, and the addition or removal \nof one or a few of the units has a negligible effect on the properties. On the other hand, a material with \nregular repeating structure but too low an average molecular weight to achieve their properties is usually \ncalled an oligomer. In other words, oligomer is a molecule that consists of a few monomer units\u201d (Naka, \n2014). Depending on the monomers, a polymer with polymer-like properties would typically consist of \naround 50\u2013100 repeat units. Chain lengths below this limit are called oligomers, in which molecules with \ntwo, three or four repeat units are called dimers, trimers and tetramers respectively.  \n\nA key point is that what is defined as a polymer varies between regulations. In polymer science a polymer \nis typically defined as a chain consisting of at least 50 monomers. Chain-lengths from two to 50 are called \noligomers. This is also the definition used in the EU food-contact materials legislation, which furthermore \nstates that a polymer should be self-supporting, i.e. not in a liquid form or so thin that the material cannot \nbe, for example, peeled off (EU, 2011). Another point is whether only feedstocks and additives/polymer \nproduction aids are (specifically) regulated, or whether the intermediates, transformation by-products, \ndegradation products and/or the final products with all impurities and residuals are also regulated. As a \nconsequence, not all substances which are used and produced throughout fluorinated polymer lifecycles \nare covered by EU regulations. \n\nIn the EU\u2019s REACH legislation, a polymer is defined as a molecule which has three or more repeat units, \ni.e. monomers (ECHA, 2012). In practice this means that a number of detergents and surfactants, which \ncontain homologue series of oligomers, are polymers according to REACH, and hence are exempted from \nregistration. It has been recorded that polyethers have been reclassified as polymers under REACH, \nwhereby they are exempt from registration (Wang et al., 2015b). While polymers are exempt from \nregistration, they are still subject to restrictions. Furthermore, registration is not needed if the \nmanufacturing or import of a substance amounts to less than 1 tonne a year. \n\nIn this report the REACH definition of a polymer is used. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 14 \n\nTable 2.1 and Figure 2.2 give an overview of some common commercial fluorinated polymers. Since the \nnumber of fluorinated polymers is large, only a few examples are described in this report. As a result, some \ncommercially relevant fluorinated polymers/elastomers of fluorinated alkyl silanes and siloxanes (Li et al., \n2016b) are not described. \n\nMore in depth information on structures, performance and applications of fluorinated polymers is \nprovided, for example, in Ameduri and Sawada\u2019s Fluorinated polymers Volumes 1 and 2 (2017) \u2013 see for \nexample Volume 2, Chapter 1: Industrial Aspects of Fluorinated Oligomers and Polymers (Dams and \nHintzer, 2017) and Chapter 4: Fluoroplastics and Fluoroelastomers \u2013 Basic Chemistry and Highperformance Applications (Ohkura and Morizawa, 2017). \n\nTable 2.1 Examples of common commercial fluorinated polymers and trade names which are or have been in use. \nFurther information is provided below in section 2.3. \n\nAbbreviation Trade name \nexamples \n\nFull name Repeat unit \n\nPTFE Teflon, Zonyl poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b \n\nPCTFE Neoflon, Voltalef, \nAclon, Aclar, \nHostaflon C2, Fluon, \nPlaskon, Halon \n\npoly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc39)\ud835\udc5b \n\nPVF Tedlar poly(vinylfluoride) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc39)\ud835\udc5b \n\nPVDF Kynar, Solef, Hylar poly(vinylidene fluoride) (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b \n\nFEP Teflon FEP, Neoflon \nFEP, Dyneon FEP \n\npoly(tetrafluoroethylene-cohexafluoropropylene) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc393)\ud835\udc5a \n\nETFE FluonETFE, Tefzel, \nNeoflon \n\npoly(ethylene-cotetrafluoroethylene) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5a \n\nECTFE  Halar ECTFE poly(ethylene-coclorotrifluoroethylene) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b2)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc39 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5a \n\nPFA Teflon-PFA, \nHostaflon-PFA, \nChemfluor \n\npoly(tetrafluoroethylene-coperfluoropropylvinylether) \n\n(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392)\ud835\udc5b\u22ef(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc392 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc42 \u2212 \ud835\udc363\ud835\udc397)\ud835\udc5a \n\nPFPE Krytox, Fomblin, \nGalden, Fluorolink, \nDemnum \n\nper- and polyfluoropolyethers various (often copolymers with an ether \npolymer backbone with F atoms directly \nattached to carbon backbone) \n\nFKM, FFKM, \nFEPM \n\nViton, Aflas, Kalrez, \nDaiel, Silastic \n\nfluoroelastomers, \nperfluoroelastomers, \ntetrafluoroethene-propene rubbers \n\nvarious \n\nSources: Am\u00e9duri, 2018; McKeen, 2017; BCC Research, 2015; Gardiner, 2015 \n\nOverviews of production volumes for the various fluorinated polymers are scarce and although several \nexamples exist of industry market reports these studies should be used with caution (Wang et al., 2017, \n2020). A few important fluoropolymers constitute the major part of the market: a recent article by Henry \net al. (2018), cited by Lohmann et al.

More information on the fluoropolymer market is presented in Section 2.3. \n\nThe fluorinated polymers in this report have been chosen based on the following criteria: \n- to illustrate different types of fluorinated polymer; \n- how widely they are used; \n- their potential to cause impacts along their lifecycles; \n- a particular focus has been to investigate fluorinated polymers which may release GHG, \n\ncontributing to climate change, or ODS along their lifecycles. \n\nBased on these criteria the fluorinated polymer examples focused on are shown in Figure 2.2 and include: \n\n\u2022 PFTE: a homopolymer, around half of the market; \n\n\u2022 PVDF: a homopolymer, the fastest growing fluorinated polymer worldwide; \n\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/chapter/bk9781782629160-00080/978-1-78262-916-0\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 15 \n\n\u2022 FEP: a copolymer, a GHG is used in its synthesis; \n\n\u2022 PFPE: polymers according to the REACH definition, typically liquid copolymers, used as industrial \nmachine oils and as coatings for food-contact paper, glass, plastics, etc; \n\n\u2022 fluorinated sidechain acrylate and urethane polymers: examples of fluorinated sidechain \npolymers, used as coatings and sizing agents for textiles and food-contact paper. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2.

The abbreviations in red denote the fluorinated polymers \nfocused on in this report. \n\nSource: ETC/WMGE \n\n2.2 Properties and production process of fluorinated polymers \n\nFluorinated polymers are widely used in industry, laboratories and consumer products due to their special \nproperties of being resistant to abrasion, heat and chemical attack and providing low friction. The unique \nproperties of fluorinated polymers are a consequence of the strong carbon\u2013fluorine (C-F) bond (5), the \n\n \n5 The bond dissociation energy depends on the surrounding molecular environment. For example the bond dissociation energy of \n\nthe C-F bond in fluoromethane (CH3F) is approximately 480 kilojoules per mole (KJ/mol), compared to the bond dissociation \nenergy of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond in methane (CH4) that is 440 kJ/mol (Blanksby and Ellison, 2003). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 16 \n\nsmall size of the fluorine atom packing closely around and protecting the carbon chain from attack, and of \nits un-polarisability ( Puts et al., 2019a; Am\u00e9duri, 2018; Henry et al., 2018; BCC Research, 2015). \n\nCarbon-fluorine bonds containing substances are by definition of concern as they are strong and difficult \nto break, thereby almost by definition rendering human and environmental persistency issues to \nfluorinated polymer, even following incineration. Albeit just a little bit less, also carbon-chlorine (C-Cl) and \ncarbon-bromine (C-Br) bonds are strong. This means that any chemical substance containing one or more \nC-F bonds and/or one or more C-Cl or C-Br bonds is theoretically of concern for persistency in aqueous \nenvironments as well as in sediments and soil compartments. Moreover, volatile and semi-volatile \nfluorocarbons and chlorocarbons are of concern for persistency in the atmosphere and for their potential \ngreenhouse and/or ozone-depleting effect. \n\nExamples of fluorinated polymers uses include membranes and tubing for industrial processes including \nfood production and water cleansing; coatings and lubricants in industrial processes; non-stick coatings on \nmetals on, for example, baking trays, frying pans and kitchen utensils; coatings on glass, stone, wood and \nplastics on, for example, building materials and windmill wings; lubricants; membranes in outdoor jackets \nand other textiles; coatings on paper and board; and microplastics in shaving foams and for metal \nlubrication (Am\u00e9duri, 2018; Scudo, Alexandra et al., 2017), as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Gl\u00fcge et al. (2020) \nprovides an overview of some uses of PFAS, including fluorinated polymers. This study did not however \ninclude all types of PFAS, because it limited its search to those containing a minimum of -CF2-CF2- units. \nLohmann et al. (2020) also discuss potential emissions of PFAS along the lifecycle of fluoropolymers, and \nin relation to some of their uses, but does not address fluorinated sidechain polymers. The recent \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on commercial information from \nvendors (OECD, 2020) also provides information on uses of fluorinated polymers. PTFE and many of the \nfluorinated polymers are authorised for use in food-contact material (FCM) plastics (EU, 2011), and are \nalso used in so-called non-harmonised FCMs which do not require authorisation by the European Food \nSafety Authority (EFSA), such as paper and board (OECD, 2020; Trier et al., 2018). \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2011/10/oj\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 17 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Consumer products and industrial applications that may contain fluorinated polymers. \n\nSource: EEA and ETC/WMGE. Illustration by CSCP. \n\nThe properties and uses of the fluorinated polymers on which this report focusses are briefly discussed \nnext. Their production is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 and their applications in Chapter 5. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 18 \n\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is the most widely used fluorinated polymer (Henry et al., 2018; Frost and \nSullivan, 2016). It is polymerised from the tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) monomer, making it a fully fluorinated \ncounterpart of polyethylene but with a rigid helical chain construction (Teng, 2012). It is the most \nchemically resistant polymer among thermoplastics and also has excellent heat resistance, electrical \ninsulation properties and one of the lowest coefficients of friction against any solid. Additionally, PTFE is \nhydrophobic, meaning neither water nor water-containing substances will wet it. These unique properties \nmake PTFE practical in applications for which characteristics such as low friction, excellent thermal \nresistance, chemical inertness (BCC Research, 2015) and electrical insulation are required. As a result, it is \nused in numerous transport applications such as seals, gaskets and valves; as coatings on metals including \ncookware and on plastics, for example on windmill blades (Am\u00e9duri, 2020; BCC Research, 2015); \nelectronics and batteries, for instance lithium-ion batteries contain 1\u20132% of PTFE/PVDF (Mossali et al., \n2020). \n\nThe high weight of fluorine compared to hydrogen and the rigid polymer chain structure results in a \nrelatively high density for a polymeric material, 2.1 grams per cubic metre; a high melting temperature of \napproximately 320 \u00b0C; low permeability to gases and liquids \u2013 high barrier properties (Keller and Kouzes, \n2017) \u2013 and a high melt viscosity. The last property makes it difficult to mould PTFE using traditional \npolymer processing methods; however, alternative methods have been developed, and today it can be \nprocessed into any shapes for almost every application area (Teng, 2012). \n\nPTFE is available as granules, fine powders and water-based dispersions, which are produced by different \npolymerisation methods (Teng, 2012). Some of these require the use of surfactants, which previously were \nammonium salts of PFOA and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (Buck et al., 2012), but which gradually have \nchanged to a variety of other PFAS, such as the fluorinated ethers GenX and ADONA (carboxylate ethers) \nand F53B (sulfonic fluorinated ether) (Wang et al., 2015b). PTFE may also be filled with other substances, \nsuch as glass, graphite, metals, minerals and colorants to obtain specific functions. There is evidence of \nrecycling of PTFE, which may have different properties from its virgin form, but information is limited \n(Hindustan Nylons, n.d.). \n\nPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has the second biggest global market share after PTFE (Frost and Sullivan, \n2016). It is polymerised from vinylidene difluoride (CH2\u2013CF2). This structure provides performance \ncharacteristics which do not match those of PTFE, but the key advantage of PVDF is its superior meltprocessing characteristics compared: it can be extruded and injection-moulded similarly to common \nthermoplastics (BCC Research, 2015). \n\nWhen compared to other melt-processable fluorinated polymers, PVDF has been found to be the strongest \nand more resistant to abrasion. It provides even better electrical insulation than PTFE, but its heat \nresistance is not as high (BCC Research, 2015). It is mainly used in industrial metal coatings, membranes, \nwire insulation, and as a binding material in batteries (Frost and Sullivan, 2016). It is widely used in \nelectronics and batteries; lithium-ion batteries contain 1\u20132% of PVDF/PTFE (Mossali et al., 2020). \n\nPer- and polyfluorinated polyethers (PFPE) form a class of fluorinated polymers in which the polymer \nbackbone contains carbon and oxygen, and fluorine atoms are directly attached to carbons, i.e. backbone \nconsists of -CF2-, -CF2CF2-, and possibly -CF(CF3)CF2- units separated by oxygen (O) atoms (Bokkers et al., \n2019; Buck et al., 2011). The structure of PFPMIE (perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethers), an example of \nPFPE, is presented in Figure 2.4. PFPE are low-molecular-weight polymers (500\u201315,000 daltons (Da)) (Dams \nand Hintzer, 2017), which means they are typically oils or greases, and therefore their most important \napplication area is in high-performance oils, lubricants for engines and machinery and as electronic liquids \n(Solvay, 2020). Their unique properties include being resistant to ionising radiation, rendering them \napplicable to the aerospace and nuclear industries (Gardiner, 2015). They have also been used as coatings \nof food-contact paper and board produced by Solvay (Trier et al., 2018; Dimzon et al., 2016), and as \ncoatings for, for example, glass. More information on industrial uses is available in Fluorinated Specialty \nChemicals \u2013 Fluorinated Copolymers for Paints and Perfluoropolyethers for Coatings (Hoshino and \nMorizawa, 2017). \n\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/chapter/bk9781782629160-00110/978-1-78262-916-0\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 19 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4. The structure of PFPMIE, an example of a PFPE. \n\nPerfluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) is a copolymer of TFE and hexafluoropropylene (HFP). It has \nsimilar mechanical and chemical properties as PTFE combined with the melt-processability of more \nconventional polymers (BCC Research, 2015). FEP has the third largest market share for fluorinated \npolymers and is the most widely used fluorinated copolymer. It is used especially in wire and cable \ninsulation in various industries including the automotive, aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, and \nelectronics sectors where resistance to chemicals and serviceability over wide temperature ranges is \nrequired (Frost and Sullivan, 2016). \n\nSidechain fluorinated polymers are a class of polymers with nonfluorinated backbones with fluorinated \nsidechains containing -CnF2n+1 (Buck et al., 2011) or -CnF2n- moieties. These include fluorinated sidechain \nacrylate polymers, fluorinated urethane polymers and fluorinated oxetane polymers. Fluorinated \nsidechain acrylate polymers are used, for example, in water-, stain- and grease-proofing finishes for textile, \nleather and paper surfaces (Trier et al., 2018) and are further discussed in Chapter 5. \n\n2.3 Market \n\nFluorinated polymers are widely used in industry and in consumer products. Reported volumes of the \nglobal production of fluorinated polymers range between 180 000 tonnes to 340 000 tonnes, depending \non the baseline year (2015\u20132018) and polymers included (Frost and Sullivan, 2016; BCC Research, 2015). \nOne of the most recent information (AGC, 2020) suggests that the global consumption of fluorinated \npolymers in 2018 amounted to 320 000 tonnes, an increase of 19% over the 2015 global consumption \nestimated at 270 000 tonnes. Compared to other plastics, they are expensive; the cost of PTFE is roughly10 \ntimes that of many other polymers (PlasticsInsight, n.d.) and their production volumes are relatively small \n\u2013 in 2018, global plastics production (6) reached almost 360 million tonnes and European production \naround 62 million tonnes (PlasticsEurope, 2019b). \n\nThe largest consumer of fluorinated polymers in 2018 was China, with a share of 37% of global \nconsumption, followed by the United States, 22%, and (western) Europe, 16% (AGC, 2020). In the United \nStates, 78 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers were consumed in 2018 while production totalled 85 000 \ntonnes (Wood, 2020). In Europe, 52 000 tonnes were consumed in 2015, slightly more than the 51 000 \ntonnes produced (PlasticsEurope, 2017). Production and consumption of fluorinated polymers in Europe \nis discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.1. \n\nFigure 2.5 shows the market shares of different fluorinated polymers \u2013 PTFE made up 53%, 171 000 \ntonnes, of fluorinated polymer consumption, PVDF 16%, 51 000 tonnes, and FEP 10%, 31 000 tonnes. \n\n \n6  Including thermoplastics, polyurethanes, thermosets, elastomers, adhesives, coatings and sealants and polypropylene (PP) \n\nfibres.

Global consumption of fluorinated polymers, 2018, 320 300 tonnes. \n\nSource: AGC (2020). \n\nMajor producers of fluorinated polymers include 3M/Dyneon (Germany), AGC Inc (Japan), Arkema \n(France), Chemours (US), Daikin Industries Ltd. (Japan), Dupont (US), Shandong Dongye Group (China), \nShanghai 3F (China), and Solvay (Belgium) (Keller, 2020; Frost and Sullivan, 2016; BCC Research, 2015). \n\n2.3.1 Production and consumption of fluorinated polymers in Europe \n\nIn 2015 around 270 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers were consumed globally, a doubling from the \n133 000 tonnes consumed in 2004 (Kr\u00e4mer and Schlipf, 2016). PTFE with 140 000 tonnes, accounted for \nthe majority of fluorinated polymers, followed by PVDF at 41 000 tonnes and FEP with 2,500 tonnes. \nAccording to data from PlasticEurope, 51 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers were produced in Europe, \nwith an additional 21 500 tonnes imported and 20 500 tonnes exported; about 52 000 tonnes were \nconsumed in EU in 2020. \n\nFigure 2.6 shows fluorinated polymer sales in the EU by main sectors in 2015, with transport, chemicals \nand power being the largest. The cookware sector is the third largest, using 3 500 tonnes per year much \nof which is likely to enter the waste stream fairly soon given the relatively short life of consumer products. \nMost of the other sectors using fluorinated polymer also potentially add to the general population\u2019s waste \nstream. If it is assumed that Europe has a similar distribution of downstream applications of fluorinated \npolymers as the United States, 16% of the fluorinated polymers consumed in Europe are used for the \nmanufacture of a broad range of consumer products. By applying consumption data for the EU mentioned \nabove, an estimated of 8 320 tonnes of fluorinated polymers will be used per year in the production of \nconsumer products that will enter the waste stream end of life. \n\nPTFE\n53%\n\nPVDF\n16%\n\nFEP\n10%\n\nPVF\n2%\n\nPFA\n1%\n\nETFE\n1%\n\nOthers\n17%\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 21 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6.

Note: percentages may not sum due to \nrounding. \n\nSource: PlasticsEurope (2018) \n\nWhile in 2004 western Europe consumed 23 900 tonnes of PTFE, 6 800 tonnes of PVDF and 4 000 tonnes \nof other fluorinated polymers (Will et al., 2005), by 2016, 32 000 tonnes of PTFE, and 36 000 tonnes of \nother fluorinated polymers were used (Kr\u00e4mer and Schlipf, 2016). According to recent reports, 4% of PTFE \npurchased in Europe is used for cooking and baking utensils, resulting in 1 280 tonnes of it potentially \nentering the waste stream within a few years. \n\n2.4 Production sites of fluorinated polymers \n\nIn general, little information is available on where fluorinated polymers are produced in the world or in \nthe EU, though information is likely available in the countries where permits are required. In 2020, many \nof the existing fluorinated polymer production sites were located in Asia, but a number of production sites \nexist in Europe. \n\nThe EU\u2019s European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR (7)) requires the European chemical \nindustry, including manufacturers of basic plastic materials such as polymers and synthetic fibres, to report \nemissions to air, water, and land of 91 pollutants, being single substances or groups of substances. \nFluorinated polymer producers, however, do not have to identify themselves as such when they report, \nso it would only be known that the company belongs to the chemical industry and that it perhaps produces \npolymers. \n\nIt would only therefore be possible to check their emissions if their names and locations were known. \nFurthermore, it would require their emissions to be above the reporting thresholds for any of the 91 \npollutants designated by the E-PRTR, which is generally not the case. Single PFAS are currently not on the \npollutant list, and though pollutants such as \u2018PFCs\u2019 in principle could be understood and measured as total \nPFAS, the description currently only mentions some specific F-gases (8). It is therefore generally not \n\n \n7 Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment \n\nof a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and amending Council Directives 91/689/EEC and 96/61/EC. It should be \nnoted that the E-PRTR Regulation is going through an Impact Assessment that will result in a revised Regulation. This will likely \ninclude new reporting fields, new pollutants and industrial activities. \n\n8 However, if the definition of PFCs was re-defined to be, for example, \u2018PFC = per and polyfluorinated carbons\u2019 which is the sum \nof all PFCs, measured as Total PFAS (including relevant F-gases and fluorinated polymers), then the reporting of this pollutant \nwould immediately apply to all facilities producing, using or handling fluorinated polymers. \n\n36%\n\n32%\n\n7%\n\n7%\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\n3%\n1%\n\n4%\n\nTransport Chemicals and power\nCookware Electronics\nFood and pharmaceuticals Textiles and architecture\nMedical applications Renewable energy\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 22 \n\npossible to identify which sites or facilities produce, use or handle fluorinated polymers or their wastes. \nOne exception are fluorinated polymer plants, which emit GHGs that are regulated by the GHG inventory. \nThe one example is the potent GHG trifluoromethane (HFC-23), which is a by-product formed in the \nmanufacture of chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). Since HCFC-22 is used for fluorinated polymer \nproduction, residual HFC-23 may be released from the polymer production sites, and must be reported. \nAlso, fugitive emissions from fluorochemical production are reported under the Common Reporting \nFormat (CRF) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The 2019 \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Refinement Report suggests a further breakdown of \nthe reported data into emissions from HCFC-22 (2.F.9a), hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) (2.F.9b), perfluorinated \ncarbon (PFC) (2.F.9c), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) (2.F.9d), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) (2.F.9e), fluoropolymer \n(2.F.9f), and other fluorochemical (2.F.9g) production. It is, however, not mandatory for any Parties to the \nUNFCCC to refer to this new guidance in their emissions reporting. In a report, Goldenman et al. (2019) \nsearched the E-PRTR and only found fluorinated polymer sites registered in relation to chlorofluorocarbon \n(CFC) emissions, but based on a search for fluoropolymer company names, they estimated that between \n12\u201320 fluorochemical facilities are in operation in Europe. \n\nAs an alternative, measurements of PFAS in the air can be used to indicate fluorinated polymer production \nsites. This can also confirm the correctness of information of known production sites. Figure 2.7 hence \nshows higher pollution near known fluorinated polymer factories in northern Italy and the Chemours Plant \nin Dordrecht in the Netherlands. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7.

In uncontrolled extraction operations, the lack of measures for \npreventing the spreading of dust from tailings ponds or spillage during operation may cause \nelevated fluoride concentrations in soil and water near the mining areas and also cause silicosis, a \nserious lung disease, in workers as a result of exposure to fine dust. \n\n3.1 Sources and use of fluorspar \n\nFluorspar is used for production of hydrofluoric acid (HF), which is one of the main chemicals needed in \nthe production of fluorinated polymers. The carbon backbone of fluorinated polymers comes from \nchlorinated hydrocarbons, as described in more detail in Chapter 4. \n\nFluorspar is the commercial name for the mineral fluorite calcium fluoride (CaF2). The mineral fluorspar \nconsists of 51.1% calcium and 48.9% fluorine in its pure form. Commercial fluorspar is graded according to \nits quality and its specification into acid, metallurgical and ceramic grades (9). HF is produced from acidgrade fluorspar. In principle, metallurgical grade fluorspar can be used for HF manufacturing, for example, \nin Russia, if the remaining impurities are acceptable (10). \n\nFluorspar, or fluorite, is the only commercially mined mineral to source fluorine. In the EU, fluorspar is \ndefined as a critical raw material, and in China and the United States as a strategic mineral (CRM Alliance, \n2020; European Commission, 2020c; Blengini , G.A. et al, 2017; EC, 2013). The classification of fluorspar as \na critical raw material is a combination of several indicators: supply risk, poor substitutability, industrial \nimportance and negligible recycling. The global supply risk is seen as particularly critical due to high \nconcentration of supply \u2013 65% of world mine output is from China and 15% from Mexico (Reichl, 2019). \n\nIn 2017, 6 million tonnes of fluorspar were extracted globally, 63% in China and 26% in Mexico, followed \nby Mongolia and South Africa (Reichl, 2019). China is by far the largest consumer of both acid grade and \nmetallurgical grade fluorspar, and declining domestic supply has led to a search for other sources, \nparticularly the importation of metspar from neighbouring Mongolia (11). \n\nA relatively minor source of fluorine is H2SiF6 (fluorosilicic acid), which is a by-product from the production \nof phosphoric acid from fluorine-containing apatite minerals (CRM Alliance, 2020; Fuge, 2019). An example \nof such a future source is the Arkema company that is building a hydrofluoric acid facility in North Carolina, \nUnited States, where they will use fluorine-containing by-products from phosphate mining as raw \nmaterials (McCoy, 2020). According to a Joint Research Centre (JRC) report (European Commission, 2020c) \nthere is, however, very little interest in recycling or closing the loop of fluorspar, because of its disparate \nuse in different applications and the lack of suitable recycling technologies. World known reserves of \n\n \n9 The main grades of fluorspar available are as follows ((EC, 2013; US, 2012; https://www.eurofluor.org/hf-production/): \n\n\u25aa crude ore (contains, for example, 25\u201330% CaF2) \n\u25aa metallurgical grade (contains a minimum of 80% CaF2) \n\u25aa ceramic grade (contains a minimum of 80\u201396% CaF2) \n\u25aa acid grade (contains a minimum of 97% CaF2) \n\n10 Arsenic and phosphate impurities are the most problematic because they are difficult to remove during ore beneficiation and \nbecause they have detrimental effects on hydrofluoric acid production. \n\n11  source: Roskill, Market Report 2020.

Mexico has \nthe world\u2019s largest fluorspar reserves, followed by China and South Africa. The new unexploited resources \nin South Africa are so extensive and the technology for exploitation are new, simple and feasible, thus \neven with a number of mine closures around the world, the supply chain is ensured. \n\nThe EU production of primary fluorspar over the period 2012\u20132016 was estimated at 254 000 tonnes per \nyear (CaF2 content) acid grade fluorspar (Reichl, 2019) compared to the consumption of 755 000 tonnes \nof both acid grade and metal grade fluorspar. There is no production of metal grade fluorspar in the EU. \nFluorspar mines in Europe (European Commission, 2020a; Lauri, L., 2016; Fluorine Forum 2019, 2019) are \nin: \n\n- Spain: fluorspar production was 130 000 tonnes both in 2016 and 2017 (European Commission, \n2020; CRM Alliance, 2020; Fuge, 2019; Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014); \n\n- Germany: in 2016, a total of 149 000 tonnes of fluorspar were mined from two deposits; \n- UK: the Cavendish mine came in operation again in 2013 and produced 65 000 tonnes acid grade \n\nfluorspar in 2018; \n- mining activity in Bulgaria closed in 2016; \n- there are numerous fluorspar deposits in France, Poland and Czechia but mining has not been \n\nconsidered economic. \n\nFigure 3.1 illustrates the use of both acid- and metal-grade fluorspar and the sources of fluorspar used in \nEurope. Acid-grade fluorspar is used in the chemical sector for the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid, a \nprecursor to the production of most other fluorine-containing chemicals (European Commission, 2020b; \nCRM Alliance, 2020; Fuge, 2019; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.

Additionally, metals and potentially oxidation of sulphides from increased \nsurface ore subjected to air contact often accelerate the release of metal to surface- and groundwater \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 25 \n\ncausing local contamination of soil and water. Furthermore, noise, vibration, water pollution and dusts \nemissions generated during mining inevitably lead to animal migration and potential death. Change in \nlandscape also affects living conditions of communities. \n\nUnderground mining influences the hydrogeological conditions at the site, especially with negative \nimpacts on the ground- and surface-water quality due to the increased release of metals and salts from \nthe rock. A special concern both in open pit and underground mining is the risk of acid drainage generation, \nwhich can occur when sulphides in the tailings oxide to sulphuric acid and there is a lack of neutralising \nminerals. (Li et al., 2016a) \n\nParticularly in uncontrolled fluorspar extraction operations, a lack of measures to prevent the spreading \nof dust from tailings ponds or spillage during operation causes elevated fluoride concentrations in soil and \nwater near the mining areas and also silicosis, a serious lung diseases, in workers from exposure to fine \ndust. High fluoride concentrations in drinking water cause health problems such as dental fluorosis \u2013 in \nseveral areas near deposits about half of the children suffer from this \u2013 and skeletal fluorosis which is not \ncurable. Elevated fluoride can also lead to considerable intellectual deficits of children. (Grandjean, 2019; \nGrayson et al., 2016) \n\nAs an example of possible environmental impacts, increased levels of fluoride have been found in animal \nmeat and plants around a fluorspar mine in Kenya where the exposure was assumed to result from poorly \ntreated wastewater from the mine (Kibet et al., 2019). Fluorspar mining has also been connected with \nheavy metal pollution: Forj\u00e1n et al. (2019), for instance, found that the historic and current fluorspar \nmining on the northern coast of Spain has brought about increased levels of mercury in the area, a result \nof the inappropriate disposal of processing waste from the mines. \n\nFurther information on environmental and health risks related to fluorspar extraction at some mines \ntogether with a description of processing of fluorspar ot hydrofluoric acid are included in Annex 1. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 26 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.

As a result, environmental releases of unknown \nquantities of harmful chemicals may occur. \n\n\u2022 Both neutral (volatile) and ionic PFAS, some of which are substances of very high concern (SVHCs), \nare used as monomers and processing aids in the production of fluorinated polymers, with \nunknown emission volumes. \n\n\u2022 There are several examples of contamination of communities and the environment around \nproduction sites. \n\n\u2022 Ionic PFAS emitted to water, soil and air during production cause contamination of livestock feed \nand human food as well as sources of drinking water. \n\n4.1 Outline of this chapter \n\nThis chapter describes examples of the production of some fluorinated polymers and their potential to act \nas a source for PFAS emissions throughout their lifecycles. The examples chosen are PTFE, PVDF, FEP, PFPE \nand fluorinated sidechain acrylate and urethane polymers. The manufactured fluorinated polymers are \ntypically further processed into products and by-products as shown in Figure 1.2. The focus of this chapter \nis the potential emissions of volatile PFAS, some of which are GHGs, ODS and ionic PFAS. Furthermore, the \nemission potentials to air, soil and water during production are discussed. \n\nThe synthesis of PTFE is described in detail as it accounts for half the market. The synthesis of other \nimportant fluorinated polymers is also discussed, albeit in less detail. This chapter also includes a common \nsection for all polymers in other key chemicals (feedstock and processing aids) used in the production of \nfluorinated polymers (Section 4.7). Furthermore, in Section 4.9, the conversion of fluorinated polymers \ninto final products is very briefly covered, but this aspect of the lifecycle was not looked at in detail. \nInformation of PFAS emissions to water, soil and air from production of fluorinated polymers is given in \nSection 4.8, but waste generated in fluorinated polymer production and PFAS emissions caused by waste \ntreatment are presented further in Chapter 6. \n\nManufactured fluorinated polymers are further processed in the manufacturing of products which \nthemselves can have human health effects, such as Teflon flu, that occur mainly in fluoropolymer \nproduction and manufacturing, but which also can be caused by cooking and baking (Greenberg and \nVearrier, 2015). \n\n4.2 A detailed look at the synthesis of important fluorinated polymers \n\n4.2.1 Synthesis of polytetrafluoroethylene \n\n4.2.1.1 Synthesis of tetrafluoroethylene \n\nThe polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, CAS no. 9002-84-0) consists of a chain of CF2 molecules (Figure \n4.1). \n\n \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 28 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

In its preparation \nprocess with TFE as feedstock, many environmentally harmful substances are involved. Figure 4.2 shows \nthe major molecules that are involved in the synthesis of TFE that ultimately starts from methane (CH4). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Substances involved in the synthesis of TFE, together with some relevant intermediates and by-products. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\nMethane is chlorinated to produce trichloromethane (chloroform) in a process that leads, through a series \nof steps, ultimately to tetrachloromethane (carbon tetrachloride, CTC), yielding chloromethane (methyl \nchloride, MC), dichloromethane (DCM) and trichloromethane (Bohnet, 2002). Table A.1 shows the \nsubstances that are involved in the synthesis of trichloromethane, together with their environmental \nimpacts in the form of GWP and ODP. \n\nTrichloromethane is then reacted with hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the presence of a catalyst from the \nsubstance class of antimony pentahalides (SbClxFy, with x+y=5) (12) to produce chlorodifluoromethane \n(HCFC-22) (Bohnet, 2002). As a highly relevant by-product, the potent GHG trifluoromethane (CHF3, HFC23) with a GWP of 12 400 is created in this reaction. Best estimates suggest that 1.5\u20133%, on average 2%, \nof the production volume of HCFC-22 is emitted in the process (13). Table A.2 gives the substances that are \ninvolved in the synthesis of HCFC-22, an ODS and potent GHG with a GWP of 1 760 and a major feedstock \nfor the production of TFE. \n\nGiven that around 94 000 tonnes of HCFC-22 were produced in the EU in 2018 (14), approximately 1 880 \ntonnes (2%) of HFC-23 would have been emitted in the process in that year. This corresponds to 23 million \ntonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq). HFC-23 is directly vented to the atmosphere in many cases \nbut can also be partially captured or thermally destroyed. The latter necessitates the use of a caustic \nscrubber to capture and further process fluorine-containing vent gases (15). While in developed countries \nemissions of HFC-23 decreased strongly after around 1998, remained relatively constant over the past 10 \nyears but increased recently (Stanley et al., 2020), global atmospheric concentrations showed a constant \n\n \n12 https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/bgp/3_8_HFC-23_HCFC-22_Production.pdf \n13 Unpublished non-confidential data from the yearly reporting on ozone-depleting substances by the ETC/CME. \n14 Unpublished non-confidential data from the yearly reporting on ozone-depleting substances by the ETC/CME. \n15 https://cdm.unfccc.int/public_inputs/inputam0001/Comment_AM0001_Honeywell_061004.pdf \n\nR\n2\n\nR\n1\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nn\n\nHCl\n\nCl\n\nCl\n\nH\n\nF Cl\n\nF\n\ntrichloromethane \n(chloroform)\n\nchlorodifluoromethane\n(HCFC-22)\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\ntetrafluoroethylene\n(TFE)\n\nH\n\nF\n\nFF\n\ntrifluoromethane \n(HFC-23)\n\nH\n\nH H\n\nH\n\nmethane\n\nHH\n\nH\n\nCl\n\nHCl\n\nH\n\nCl\n\nClCl\n\nCl\n\nCl\n\ntetrachloromethane\n(CTC)\n\nchloromethane\n(MC)\n\ndichloromethane\n(DCM)\n\noctafluorocyclobutane \n(PFC-318)\n\nF\n\nFF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF F\n\nF\n\nhttps://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/bgp/3_8_HFC-23_HCFC-22_Production.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 29 \n\nincrease over the last decades (16). Since the recent uptake in emissions in developed countries is due to \nRussia and the US (Stanley et al. 2020), and the corresponding HCFC-22 production quantities have been \nrelatively constant in the last decade, it can be concluded that in Europe measures are routinely in place \nto abate some of the emissions of HFC-23 from manufacturing facilities. Very roughly, it can be \napproximated that around 240 gigagrams17 of HCFC-22 were produced annually in the last decade in \ndeveloped countries, with around 1.6 Gg of by-produced HFC-23 (Figure 1 in Stanley et al. 2020). Given a \n2% rate of by-produced HFC-23, around 4.8 Gg are expected to be emitted to the atmosphere each year, \nroughly three times what is being reported. Assuming proper reporting, facilities in Europe should abate \naround two-thirds of by-produced HFC-23, with one-third being vented to the atmosphere. \n\nTFE is commercially synthesised from HCFC-22 by pyrolysis at 750\u2013950 \u00b0C (Puts et al., 2019; Siegemund et \nal., 2000) but HFC-23 can be used instead of HCFC-22. \n\nBy-products of both routes include, apart from HF and HCl, perfluoro- and chlorofluorocarbon products, \nsuch as hexafluoropropylene (HFP, CF3CF=CF2) (Puts et al., 2019) that degrades entirely in the atmosphere \nto the highly persistent trifluoroacetic acid (Mashino et al., 2000a), the strong GHG octafluorocyclobutane \n(PFC-318) (M\u00fchle et al., 2019), which has a GWP of 9 540 and the acutely toxic perfluoroisobutylene (PFIB) \nused as a warfare agent (Puts et al., 2019a). Table A.3 gives an overview of substances involved in the \nsynthesis of TFE. \n\nTFE used for polymerisation is usually 99.99% pure and contaminants include HCl, CF4 (GWP 6 630), HFP, \ntrifluoroethane (C2F3H3, GWP 328 or 4 800, depending on the isomer: 1,1,2-trifluoroethane (HFC-143) or \n1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HFC-143a)), difluoroethane (C2F2H4, GWP 16 or 138, depending on the isomer: 1,2difluoroethane (HFC-152) or 1,1-difluoroethane (HFC-152a)), and hexafluoroethane (PFC-116, C2F6, GWP \n11 100) (Puts et al., 2019). \n\nBox 4.1 \nGlobal warming potential and ozone-depleting potential \nSome gases have the potential to contribute to global warming or harm the protective ozone layer. So-called GHGs \nabsorb infrared radiation in specific frequency ranges, thus trapping heat within the troposphere, the lowest layer of \nthe atmosphere. The most abundant GHG is CO2, which serves as a reference for calculating the GWP of other gases \non a per kg basis. Typically, the GWP is calculated over a time horizon of 100 years. Based on the 5th IPCC Assessment \nReport, CH4, for example, has a GWP of 28, meaning that 1 kg of CH4 that is released into the atmosphere will lead \nto an increase in temperature that is equal to the emission of 28 kg of CO2. The higher the GWP, the stronger the \nGHG in terms of its contribution to global warming. Generally, more stable molecules can exert their effect for a \nlonger time, and therefore halogenated gases, mostly containing chlorine, fluorine or bromine, usually have high \nGWPs. \n\nIt should be noted that the 6th IPCC Assessment Report, on average, lists higher GWPs for CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs than \nthe 5th Assessment Report. Also, GWPs are only calculated for the specific substance in question without regard for \nany other GHG that may be produced in the process of manufacturing or destroying the specific substance along \ntheir lifecycles.  \n\nApart from increasing global temperature, and due to their long atmospheric lifetimes, halogenated gases, mostly \ncontaining chlorine or bromine, can reach the stratosphere, the upper part of the atmosphere. Here, they can react \nwith ice crystals in polar stratospheric clouds, releasing chlorine and bromine radicals that, energised by sunlight, can \nbreak down ozone (O3) into oxygen, (O2), destroying the protective ozone layer and leading to a seasonal ozone hole, \nmainly over the southern hemisphere. Analogously to the GWP, the magnitude of ozone-depletion of a gas is \nexpressed as ODP and calculated based on the effect of the reference molecule trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), \nwhich has an ODP of 1. For example, HCFC-22, a potent GHG with a GWP of 1 760, has an ODP of 0.55, that is, 1 kg \nof HCFC-22 has the same effect on the ozone layer as 0.55 kg of CFC-11. \n\n \n16 http://agage2.eas.gatech.edu/data_archive/data_figures/monthly/pdf/HFC-23_mm.pdf \n17 Gigagram (109 grams) \n\nhttp://agage2.eas.gatech.edu/data_archive/data_figures/monthly/pdf/HFC-23_mm.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 30 \n\n4.2.1.2 Polymerisation of polytetrafluoroethylene \n\nPTFE can be polymerised from TFE by different methods. The most frequently employed method in largescale industrial facilities is conventional radical polymerisation (Puts et al., 2019). The PTFE polymer is \ngrown by successively adding TFE monomer blocks to the polymer chain. In industrial processes, dispersion \nor emulsion polymerisation in an aqueous medium are most frequently employed, which necessitates \nadding different substances to the reaction mix. For example, less than 0.6 mol % of perfluoromethyl vinyl \nether (PMVE) is frequently added to impart specific mechanical properties (Puts et al., 2019). Many other \nsubstances are added in the polymerisation process that will be briefly introduced. \n\n4.2.1.2.1 Initiators \n\nTo initiate the polymerisation reaction, certain chemicals are added to generate free radicals. Many \ndifferent initiators can be used, which will influence the mechanical properties and the stability of the \npolymer towards degradation. Degradation typically occurs at the residual radical sites or end-groups in \nthe PTFE, and through radical reactions which may be initiated upon heating, oxidative or other kinds of \nstress (Puts et al., 2019). From the group of inorganic initiators, persulfates, and especially ammonium \npersulfate, are the preferred choice. Most commonly, however, organic peroxides are added as initiators. \nAlso, fluorinated initiators, mainly from the group of oligo (hexafluoropropylene oxide) peroxides and \nbis(pentafluoropropionyl) peroxide, are employed by industry. A selection of initiators is presented in \nTable A.4. \n\n4.2.1.2.2 Solvents/carriers \n\nPolymerisation of TFE needs an electron source that can be the solvent or better, carrier, the choice of \nwhich is, among other aspects, linked to the used initiator (Puts et al., 2019). Preferred solvents are water, \nPFCs, as well as CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs. Table A.5 gives an overview of possible halogenated \nsolvents/carriers. \n\n4.2.1.2.3 Dispersants \n\nDispersing agents are needed in emulsion polymerisation to produce fine PTFE powder (Puts et al., 2019). \nHistorically, perfluorinated monocarboxylic acid, including their salts, have been the most frequently \nemployed dispersants, for example perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Table A.6 gives an overview of some \ndispersants (surfactants). \n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), or its salt ammonium pentadecafluorooctanoate (APFO), have been the \ndispersant of choice for the polymerisation of TFEs since the 1950s. Replacements need to contain \nfluorinated moieties in order to be compatible with TFE in the polymerisation step. Commercialised \nfluorinated alternatives are, for example, per- and polyfluorinated polyethers (PFPEs), including ADONA \nand GenX (see Table A.6). Many other suspected perfluoroether carboxylic acids (PFECA) are in use, \ncausing harmful emissions to the environment. \n\n4.2.1.2.4 Chain transfer agents \n\nChain transfer agents (CTAs) cause problems in the reaction since they terminate the polymer chain but \nthey are sometimes needed because without them macroradicals can be trapped in the polymer matrix, \nresulting in lower thermal stability (Puts et al., 2019). Further, they prevent the product from sticking to \nthe walls. For this purpose, substances such as H2, hydrocarbons, certain HFCs (listed in Table A.7), such as \nHFC-23, or citric acid are added as chain transfer agents. \n\n4.3 Polyvinylidene fluoride \n\nPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Figure 4.3) is the fastest growing fluorinated polymer worldwide and is \nused as insulating material in electrical and electronic applications and as a coating in the construction \nindustry. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 31 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3.

Three main methods for synthesising \nVDF are described by (Siegemund et al., 2000): \n\n1. Dechlorination of 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-132b), an ODS and a potent GHG with a \nGWP 320, at 500 \u00b0C in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example nickel (Ni) or zinc (Zn); \n\n2. Dehydrochlorination of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-142b), an ODS and a very potent GHG \nwith a GWP 1 980, at 700\u2013900 \u00b0C; and, less often mentioned, \n\n3. Dehydrofluorination of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HFC-143a), a very potent GHG with a GWP of 4 800, \nat 1 100\u20131 300 \u00b0C. \n\nThe route using 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-132b) is shown in Figure 4.4. 1,2-dichloro-1,1difluoroethane itself is synthesised by fluorination of trichloroethylene (TCE, Tri) (Domininghaus, 1998). \nToday, most TCE is synthesised from 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE, ClCH2-CH2Cl, CAS no. 107-06-2), a process \nthat also yields tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE, CCl2=CCl2, CAS no. 127-18-4) (Weissermel \nand Arpe, 1988). 1,2-dichloroethane itself is synthesised from ethylene (H2C=CH2, CAS no. 74-85-1) \n(Weissermel and Arpe, 1988). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4. Substances involved in the synthesis of VDF. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\nRelevant substances involved in the synthesis of VDF and PVDF, together with their GWPs and ODPs are \nlisted in Table A.8. \n\nVDF is also marketed as a copolymer with HFP, which is synthesised by pyrolysis of HCFC-22, in which TFE \nand perfluorocyclobutane (PFC-318) are by-produced (Halliwell, 1967). \n\nApplying similar assumptions as for PTFE and APFO-technologies, perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA) \nemissions caused during the production of PVDF can be estimated, resulting in global emissions of 17.1 \ntonnes per year, of which 3.3 tonnes per year are from Europe. \n\nR\n2\n\nR\n1\n\nF\n\nF\n\nH\n\nH\n\nn\n\nCH2CH2\n\nH\n\nCl Cl\n\nCl\n\nHH\n\nHCl\n\nClH\n\nClF\n\nHCl\n\nHF\n\nCl\n\nCl Cl\n\nCl\n\nethylene\n\n1,2-dichloroethane \n(DCE)\n\n1,1,2-trichloroethylene \n(TCE, Tri)\n\ntetrachloroethylene \n(PCE)\n\n1,2-dichloro-1,1difluoroethane \n(HCFC-132b)\n\nH\n\nF H\n\nF\n\n1,1-difluoroethylene \n(VDF)\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 32 \n\n4.4 Per- and polyfluorinated polyethers \n\nPer- and polyfluorinated polyethers (PFPEs), also called perfluoroalkylether (PFAE) or \nperfluoropolyalkylether (PFPAE), are a diverse group of liquid to pasty fluorinated polymers. Apart from \ntheir use as lubricants, they are also contained as emollients in skin-care products and other cosmetics. \nMost frequently, the subgroup of perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ethers (PFPMIEs) are mentioned as \nrepresentatives of the PFPE group (Figure 4.5). PFPMIEs are sold under brand names such as Galden or \nFluorinert for low molecular mass perfluoroethers, and Krytox or Fomblin for high molecular mass ones \n(Siegemund et al., 2000). Low molecular mass PFPMIEs are prepared by the electrochemical fluorination \nof aliphatic (not aromatic) ethers, alcohols or carboxylic acids, such as isomers of C6F12O, C7F4O or C8F16O, \nor by fluorination of partially fluorinated or nonfluorinated ethers (Siegemund et al., 2000). High molecular \nmass PFPMIEs, on the other hand, are synthesised from hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO, 2,2,3-trifluoro3-(trifluoromethyl)oxirane, CAS no. 428-59-1) or from perfluorinated olefins, such as TFE or HFP. The latter \nis also the feedstock for hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) (Oppenheimer et al., 2007). \n\nThe PFPMIE demnum (F-(CF2CF2CF2O)n-CF2CF3) can be synthesised from tetrafluorooxetane (2,2,3,3tetrafluorooxetane, C3H2F4O, CAS no. 765-63-9) (Howell et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Structure of PFPMIE with the repeating monomer units n and m. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\nAppendix 8.A in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Climate Change 2013: The Physical \nScience Basis (IPCC 2013) lists one PFPMIE with the formula CF3OCF(CF3)CF2OCF2OCF3 (Figure 4.5 with n = 1 \nand m = 1) with a GWP of 8 070. Based on the atmospheric lifetime and radiative forcing of \nCF3OCF(CF3)CF2OCF2OCF3, Young et al. (2006) derived a GWP of 1.95 times that of trichlorofluoromethane \n(CFC-11, CCl3F), which would amount to 9 535, given a GWP for CFC-11 of 4 890. \n\n4.5 Perfluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymers \n\nPerfluorinated ethylene\u2010propylene (FEP) is a copolymer of TFE and HFP. It retains most of the desirable \ncharacteristics of (PTFE) but with a melt viscosity low enough for conventional melt processing. The \nintroduction of HFP lowers the melting point of PTFE from 327 \u00b0C to about 260 \u00b0C. As a thermoplastic, it \ncan be processed by extrusion and compression, injection and blow moulding. Films can be heat bonded \nand sealed, vacuum formed, and laminated to various substrates. Aqueous and nonaqueous dispersion \npolymerisations are the most convenient routes of producing these copolymers. The polymerisation \nconditions are similar to those of TFE homopolymer dispersion polymerisation (Gangal and Brothers, \n2010). Dispersion is used as a coating for glass fabric, chemical barriers and wire insulating tapes; as \nadhesive coatings for bonding seals and bearings of PTFE to metallic and non-metallic components; and as \nantifriction or antistick coatings for metals. The fusion of FEP to provide a continuous film depends on a \ntime-temperature relationship; 1 minute at 400 \u00b0C or 40 minutes at 290 \u00b0C is sufficient to achieve good \nfusion (Gangal and Brothers, 2010). \n\n4.6 Fluorinated sidechain polymers \n\nSidechain fluorinated polymers consist of a carbon chain backbone not containing any fluorine, with \nattached polyfluorinated and perfluorinated side chains (Figure 4.6). Some examples are fluorinated \nacrylates, urethanes and oxetanes. During the lifetime of these fluorinated polymers, unreacted side \nchains can be released \u2013 mostly telomeric PFAS as, for example, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs)\u2013 or these \n\nO\n\nF\n\nF\n\nO\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\nFF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF O\n\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nn\n\nm\n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 33 \n\nsidechains can degrade and release ionic PFAS (Figure 4.7). Perfluorinated carboxylic acids are the most \ncommon breakdown product (Dinglasan-Panlilio and Mabury, 2006). In 2006, polymers made up \napproximately 80% of the reported production in the fluorotelomer market (Dinglasan-Panlilio and \nMabury, 2006). In the same paper, unbound alcohols from the monomer phase of the process were found \nas residuals from the methacrylate monomer, indicating either incomplete synthesis or poor purification \nat the monomer step of the manufacturing process. Due to the high volatility of the telomeric PFAS used \nas sidechains, this group of fluorinated polymers can act as a substantial contribution to the atmospheric \nburden of volatile PFAS and subsequently as an environmental pollutant with ionic PFAS as a final \ndegradation product. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6.

For the fluorinated sidechain polymers, hydrocarbon chemicals are \nused to make the hydrocarbon backbone, for instance an acrylic polymer, to which fluorinated sidechains \nare attached. The fluorinated sidechains may be linked to the polymer backbone through heteroatoms \nsuch as oxygen, sulphur or amino groups, in the form of esters, thioesters, ethers, amines, imine, etc., \nwhich will make the fluorinated sidechains more or less amenable to degradation. Fluorotelomer alcohols \nhave been used as sidechains. The chemicals used to produce these fluorinated sidechains are described \nelsewhere. Information on GWP and ODP values of substances linked to fluorinated polymer production \nare provided in Annex 2. \n\n4.7.2 Fluorinated production aids involved in the synthesis of fluorinated polymers \n\nIn the majority of cases, fluorinated polymer production requires not only fluorine-containing feedstock \nchemicals but also fluorinated production aids for polymers, as defined by the Plastics regulation for foodcontact materials EU 10/2011, such as dispersion aids and polymerisation initiators. Production of such \nfluorinated production aids can also lead to emissions of a large number of poly- and perfluorinated byproducts, both highly volatile and water soluble (Hopkins et al., 2018). \n\nSecondly, the fluorinated polymers, such as PTFE, are themselves processed at high temperatures of 340\u2013\n400 \u00b0C, using up to 0.5% w/w of perfluoro- and polyfluoro-emulsifiers and dispersing agents including \nADONA, GenX and other PFOA replacements (Table A 6) (Gomis et al., 2015). In general, the use of salts of \nPFECA substances with 4\u22129 per- or polyfluorinated carbons and 1\u22123 ether bonds \u2013 Chemours products \nGenX (CAS no. 62037\u221280\u22123), ADONA (CAS no. 958445\u221244\u22128) and products from Asahi (CAS no. \n908020\u221252\u22120) and Solvay (CAS no. 329238\u221224\u22126) are mostly reported (Song et al., 2018). Their molecular \nstructures often contain perfluorinated alkyl chains no longer than four fluorinated carbons. Fluorinated \nsidechains or ether linkages interrupt the carbon chains and fluorine is replaced with chlorine atoms at the \nend of the perfluoroether chain. Though heteroatoms can increase degradability in some cases, ether and \nthioether links tend to be very stable towards degradation and therefore do not substantially decrease the \npersistency (Krafft and Riess, 2015). The bioaccumulation of the fluorinated emulsifier may also \ncorrespond to the long chain PFAS according to modelling. The inclusion of Cl will mean that the PFAS \nevade restrictions such as being precursors of specific chemicals such as PFOS, where one F has been \nreplaced by Cl (Washington et al., 2020). Their fluorinated degradation products may however still be \npersistent. As one consequence of the modified molecular design, higher emissions to the atmosphere can \nbe expected, because the volatility of the replacement chemicals, perfluoro triether carboxylic acids \n(PFTECAs), is higher than that of PFOA, and as seen by their higher air-water partition coefficient (KAW) \nvalues (Crookes and Fisk, 2018; Gomis et al., 2015), PFTECAs show lower partitioning into water, i.e., they \nare less mobile. Calculation of long-range transport potentials (LRTP) by Gomis et al. (2015) estimated a \nsimilar overall persistence (Pov) of the PFOA replacements of 1 038 days (GenX, PFTECA), and conclude that \neven though PFECAs and polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (PFESAs) which are alternatives to PFOA and \nPFOS, respectively, contain some structural differences, their physicochemical properties are not \nsignificantly changed compared to those of their predecessors. \n\nFurther, several additional production aid candidates have been reported in wastewater or river water \ndownstream of plants manufacturing fluorinated polymers including monochlorine-substituted \nperfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (Cl-PFCAs), monohydrogen-substituted PFCAs (H-PFCAs), hydrogensubstituted PFCAs (x H-PFCAs), monoether PFECA substances, and polyether PFECA substances as well as \npolyether sulfonic acids (Gebbink et al., 2017; Newton et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Shi et \nal., 2015; Strynar et al., 2015). Other compounds are suspected to be by-products emitted from \nfluoromonomer and Nafion production. For example, the C3 Perfluoro(2-methyl-3-oxahexanoyl) fluoride \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 36 \n\n(also called a HFPO dimer, acid fluoride) is a useful HFPO intermediate typically used in the synthesis of \nfluoromonomers, fluorinated polymers and to add fluorine functionality to a variety of organic precursors \n(Hopkins et al., 2018). \n\n4.8 Emissions by fluorinated polymer production \n\nAs described in Chapter 4.7, transformation and degradation products may be formed from the \npolymerisation aids used in the fluorinated polymer production. Emitted PFAS may be neutral or ionic. In \naddition to the examples given below, there are several pollution cases reported around the globe, \nincluding the discovery of new pollutants around the well-known site of the 3M factory in Belgium. \n\nNo information on the emission of neutral, small-sized PFAS molecules was available aside that mentioned \nabove on their potential formation during the production process and what is reported by M\u00fchle et al. \n(2019). These authors report that several facilities in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United \nKingdom, which likely produce PTFE, are co-located with identified perfluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8) emission \nhot spots (0.026 \u00b1 0.013 Gg per year). Potentially, both GHG and ODS can also be formed and subsequently \nemitted if no suitable and efficient removal measures are applied. \n\nFor emissions of ionic PFAS, however, model estimates are available in the literature. To estimate the \nmagnitude of ongoing ionic PFAS emissions during PTFE production, PFCA emission estimates from the \nlifecycle of PFOA-based products published by Wang et al., (2014) were used. \n\nThe available modelled emission data covering the complete lifecycle of PFOA-based products, enable the \nextraction of the emission estimates for PFCAs during the production of a number of fluorinated polymers \n(PFOA-based PTFE, FEP and PFA) (Figure 4.8). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8. Illustration of used data for emission estimation of ionic PFAS production aids during fluorinated polymer \nproduction. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 37 \n\nNote: PFCA emissions can be explained by four processes marked with red circles: direct and indirect formation during the \nproduction of sidechain fluorinated polymers, direct emissions during the production of PTFE and other fluorinated polymers \nSources: OECD (2018); modified from Wang et al. (2014) \n\nWang et al. (2014) expected that after 2015 there would be no fluorinated polymer production using APFO \ntechnology in western Europe. To cover the worst-case scenario for ionic PFAS emissions, 2015 data for \nthe \u2018higher\u2019 scenario in Wang et al. (2014) were used to estimate possible emissions of PFCA substitutes \ncaused by the ongoing global PTFE production. Unsurprisingly, the global PFAS emissions caused by \nfluorinated polymer production of PTFE, FEP and PFA constitute 609 t/year, about 97% of the estimated \ntotal emissions of 627 t/year estimated for all fluorinated polymers. Since European fluorinated polymer \nproduction represents about 20% of the global total, the resulting PFAS emissions (of PFOA and PFNA \nsubstitutes) can be estimated to be about 120 t/year, when assuming similar usage and emissions by the \nsubstituted PFAS on the basis of the similarities between PFOA and replacement chemicals, and assumed \nlimited changes in emissions control during fluorinated polymer manufacture. A different composition of \nthe emissions is, however, expected with fewer PFCAs containing a perfluorinated chain length of eight \ncarbon atoms (C8) and a longer and rather broader variety of branched, ether-linked or chlorine containing \nreplacement PFAS. Due to the broad variety of the composition of emissions, a differing environmental \ndistribution of emitted PFAS to the aquatic phase, the atmosphere and/or the terrestrial sphere is also \nexpected. However, besides GenX, no emission volumes of PFOA replacements are available, either in the \nshape of measured field data or modelled emission data.  \n\nOn the other hand, Adona and GenX, which have a similar polarity but a smaller molecular size than PFOA, \ndisplay slightly more hydrophilic behaviour. Conversely, larger molecules, such as PFTECAs, have a higher \nair-water partition coefficient (KAW) than PFOA, supporting increased atmospheric distribution. \n\nAdding even more complexity to PFAS used as fluorinated polymer production aids is the manufacture of \nthe chemicals themselves. Hopkins et al. (2018) also report that atmospheric emissions of the GenX \nprecursor, a tricarbon (C3) dimer acid fluoride (CAS no. 2062-98-8), possibly causes elevated aquatic levels \nof hexafluoropropylene oxide\u2013dimer acid (HFPO-DA/GenX) in lakes and rivers (Hopkins et al., 2018). \n\nA recent study reported that only 50% of the fluorinated polymer processing aid GenX is captured from \nthe production waste streams of the Chemours plant in Dordrecht, the Netherlands (Gebbink and van \nLeeuwen, 2020). Emissions of PFOA, PFNA and synthesis by-products from other fluorinated polymer \nproduction sites have been thoroughly documented in China and the United States over the years, and \nprobably in Europe as well in the past (Fang et al., 2020; Panikkar et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Jin et al., \n2015; Shi et al., 2015; Strynar et al., 2015). The emissions have been shown to lead to widespread \nenvironmental contamination of air, soil, water and food (Guillette et al., 2020; Pellizzaro et al., 2018; \nValsecchi et al., 2015), but whether these emissions are still ongoing in the EU is unclear. However, the \nemissions of c-C4F8 linked with TFE/HFP/PTFE/FEP production facilities show the potential of other \nemissions of both neutral and ionic PFAS from such facilities (M\u00fchle, et al., 2019). \n\nDue to the high volatility of most of the neutral PFAS, the atmosphere is expected to act as the target sink \nfor the majority of these compounds. Telomeric PFAS as FTOHs, will eventually degrade to form the \nenvironmentally stable PFCAs while neutral sulphonamides might degrade to PFSAs, further distributing \ninto the terrestrial and aquatic global spheres and adding to the overall global ionic PFAS burden as indirect \nsources. On top of this, direct emissions of ionic PFAS are also still happening as outlined above, possibly \nmore so than through indirect sources, causing a complex mix of final degradation products including \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 38 \n\nPFCAs and PFSAs, intermediates and precursor compounds polluting the environment. Surface and \ndrinking water, soil and agricultural produce have been reported to exhibit major contamination with PFAS \nin the vicinity of manufacturing sites in China, Europe and the United States (Box 4.2). \n\nAccording to Li et al. (2017), 99% of C4 to C7 PFCAs and to a slightly lower extent C8 to C12 PFCAs will \ndistribute to the hydrosphere, while C13 and longer chained PFCAs will increasingly be adsorbed by \nsediments and soil (Li et al., 2017). \n\nIn general, a broad contamination of the surrounding environment, spreading in both the terrestrial and \nthe aquatic spheres, has been documented for a range of fluorinated polymer production sites and is to \nbe expected for all fluorinated polymer manufacturing and fabrication sites. Harmful impacts on wildlife \nand human health are to be expected, especially in terms of food and drinking-water safety. \n\nBox 4.2 Impact on soil and water \u2013 case example of emissions \n\nIn several studies from the Netherlands (Gebbink and van Leeuwen, 2020; Brandsma et al., 2019), France \n(Bach, 2017), China (Song et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2015b), the United States (Hopkins et al., 2018), and \nJapan (Shiwaku et al., 2016) water samples and in some cases in soil, grass and leaf samples were collected \nat different distances from fluoropolymer manufacturing plants for measurement of PFAS or fluorinated \nsubstances. Vegetables used for human consumption and grown close to PFAS production facilities in \nChina contained high concentrations of short chained PFCAs, proving an efficient uptake of water soluble \nPFAS in plants (Zhang et al., 2017). In most cases, the highest PFAS concentrations were detected near \nthe manufacturing plants supporting the hypothesis that plants are primary sources for PFAS emitted in \nthe surroundings. \n\nEmissions to the environment from a Dutch Chemours manufacturing plant have been in analysed \n(Gebbink and van Leeuwen, 2020; Gebbink et al., 2017) based on information in public databases. Key \nfigures from the articles include the following. \n\n\u2022 In a Dutch manufacturing plant producing PTFE, and FEP, PFOA was used until 2012 as a \npolymerisation aid. Since 2013, it has been substituted by GenX, an ammonium salt of 2,3,3,3tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoroporoxy)propanoic acid. \n\n\u2022 In 2012, emissions of PFOA to the air were estimated to 134 kg, considerably less than in 1995 when \nemissions peaked at 6 800 kg. The cumulative amount emitted to air was calculated to be around 36 \ntonnes based on years for which data were available. Emissions to water, however, have not been \nreported. \n\n\u2022 It has been estimated, based on mass balance calculation, that 55% of the GenX used was incinerated \nand 40% recycled. The emissions to water and air were approximately 4% and 1% respectively. Based \non GenX usage of 50 tonnes in 2017, approximately 2 000 kg and 500 kg were emitted to water and \nair, respectively. \n\n\u2022 Wastewater directed to a treatment plant contained, on average, 0.15 micrograms per litre (\u00b5g/l) \nPFOA and 2.3 \u00b5g/l GenX (2017). Due to the higher water solubility of GenX than PFOA, the removal of \nGenX is less efficient in the municipal water treatment plant. \n\n\u2022 Generally, the detected concentrations of PFOA and GenX in surface and groundwater samples were \nlow, with concentrations decreasing further from the plant. \n\n\u2022 GenX and PFOA have been detected in leaves and grass within 3 kilometres northeast of the plant \nwith concentrations decreasing with distance. It was advised not to consume vegetables grown within \na radius of 1 kilometre of the plant (Brandsmaa, 2019). \n\n\u2022 The tolerable daily intake for PFOA and GenX was only exceeded in the maximum exposure scenario \nbased on year-round consumption of local vegetables and exposure to drinking water and air. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 39 \n\n4.9 Manufacturing/conversion of fluorinated polymers into final products \n\nIn addition to production sites, the manufacturing of fluorinated polymers, for example by conversion into \nfinal products, sintering or their application may also cause environmental contamination by, for example, \nPFAS. Information provided by companies to the United States Food and Drug Administration shows that \nsome types of fluorinated sidechain acrylate polymers may only be 88\u201391% retained when applied to foodcontact paper and board (EDF, 2018; Neltner and Maffini, 2018). Some is released to water and some \nretained in sludge which should be landfilled or incinerated \u2013 in the United States 80% is landfilled and \n20% incinerated. No such assessment is available in Europe, even though there are known occurrences of \naccidental releases in, for example, Germany and Italy (Goldenman et al., 2019; Ministerium f\u00fcr Umwelt, \nKlima und Energiewirtschaft Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 2018). \n\nAs an additional step, fluorinated polymers can also be applied as coatings to other surfaces, such as \ncooking utensils, by baking on and/or sintering at high temperatures of up to 420 \u00b0C for up to 10 minutes. \nMany materials and articles made using these coatings are intended for repeated use in contact with all \ntypes of foodstuffs. The conditions of use include short-time contact at temperatures up to around 100 \u00b0C \nfor food processing equipment and food contact articles. Contact conditions for high temperature \napplication coatings include 230 \u00b0C for 1\u20132 hours and may even reach 250 \u00b0C for a short time (EFSA, 2010). \nEmissions during the coating of products with fluorinated polymers can be cleaned by a two-stage air \npollution control device used to collect the submicron particulate matter released during the sintering of \nthe PTFE. The fibre-bed diffusion filters are designed to collect both solid and liquid particulates. \n\nDuring the manufacturing and conversion, PFAS processing aids, impurities and degradation products may \nbe released. For instance, processing aids, such as PFTECA (CAS no. 329238-24-6), are volatile and \ncompletely evaporate at 190 \u00b0C. PFTECA is soluble in water and in organic solvents but is expected to be \nstable to heat and not to react with food constituents. Considering the type of application, such as nonstick coatings on cookware, these coatings are processed at very high temperatures, above 300 \u00b0C. Under \nsuch conditions, any residues of the volatile substance and other migratable impurities will be removed \nefficiently (EFSA, 2010). To avoid atmospheric and other emissions, however, closed systems are required \nfor the manufacturing of fluorinated polymers. \n\n4.10 Knowledge gaps \n\n\u2022 Identity and usage of fluorine-containing fluorinated polymer production aids. \n\n\u2022 Emission data of fluorine-containing fluorinated polymer production aids (PFOA and PFNA \nalternatives) and other emitted PFAS. \n\n\u2022 Emission data of PFAS emissions during production of fluorine-containing fluorinated polymer \nproduction aids. \n\n\u2022 Physical-chemical properties of PFOA and PFNA alternatives including bioaccumulation potential \nand persistency. \n\n\u2022 Identity, usage and physical-chemical properties of poly- and perfluorinated sidechains used in \nfluorinated polymers. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 40 \n\n5 Use phase: uses and potential emissions from pollutants \n\nMain author: Elina Pohjalainen \nContributors: Dorte Herzke (Microplastics) and Elina Yli-Rantala (Degradation to micropowders) \n\nKey messages \n\n\u2022 Fluorinated polymers are used in a diverse range of applications due to their unique properties \nsuch as the ability to repel water/dirt and chemical stability. The transport, chemical and power \nsectors are the largest users of fluorinated polymers. \n\n\u2022 Typically, fluorinated polymers are only a part of component or in coatings. Thus, exposure is \nhighly application specific. Impacts of their use phase are not deeply analysed in this report \n\n\u2022 The use phase of fluorinated polymers may lead to PFAS entering the environment: \n\n\u2022 degradation of materials in use: for example, the wearing and tearing of durable, waterrepellent (DWR) textiles due to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high temperatures and humidity; \n\n\u2022 overheating of PTFE kitchenware; etc. \n\n\u2022 Direct human exposure during use phase: \n\n\u2022 dietary intake as a result of leaching of substances from food-contact materials into food; \n\n\u2022 inhalation as a result of indoor dust impacted by carpets, furniture, textiles and other surface \ntreated materials, heating or spaying products containing fluorinated polymers; \n\n\u2022 dermal contact from textiles and cosmetics/personal care products; \n\n\u2022 medical utensils such as implants or ophthalmic uses. \n\n\u2022 Microplastics: \n\n\u2022 released either directly into the environment due to intentional use in products, or indirectly \nafter the physical degradation of macro-sized fluorinated polymers in products or \nmismanaged waste; \n\n\u2022 microplastics end up in wastewater treatment plants and are not recovered. For example, \nfibres including fluorinated polymers are released from textiles during washing, cosmetics and \npersonal care products when they are washed off during/after use, etc. \n\n5.1 General remarks on the use of fluorinated polymers in different applications \n\nThe use of fluorinated polymers is widespread. The main industrial sectors using fluorinated polymers and \ntheir market shares are briefly discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. The transport, chemical and power sectors \nare the largest users of fluorinated polymers, accounting for approximately two-thirds of their sales in \nEurope. In the automotive industry, for example, fluorinated polymers make up approximately 350 grams \nper car and are used in items such as seals, gaskets and transmission components, as well as cables and \nhoses (Am\u00e9duri, 2020). Consumer products such as kitchenware, electronics and textiles are the next \nlargest users of fluorinated polymers. An interesting application of fluorinated polymers is in the \nrenewable energy sector where they are used in photovoltaic panels, fuel cells and batteries, all \nincreasingly important applications in the transition to a low carbon economy. Different applications for \nvarious fluorinated polymers are described in, for example, Puts et al. (2019), Am\u00e9duri, (2018; 2020), Dams \nand Hintzer (2017) and Gardiner (2015). \n\nPotential impacts of fluorinated polymers from the use phase are not the main focus in this report and \nimpacts from all potential uses are not thoroughly reviewed. Instead in the following sections, three \nexample cases of fluorinated polymer use are briefly presented, with an emphasis on PFAS releases to the \nenvironment as well as human exposure during use phase. The use and pollution from (PTFE) microplastics \nis also discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. More information on risks to human health and environment from \nPFAS can be found in, for example, a recent EEA briefing (EEA, 2019). Different pathways of human \nexposure to PFAS and their health effects are reviewed, for example, in Sunderland et al. (2019). In general, \ndirect human exposure to specific PFAS due to the use of products that contain them can be quickly phased \nout by shifts in product compositions, whereas much longer timescales must be expected for the \namelioration of their accumulation in groundwater and the wider environment. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 41 \n\n5.2 Fluorinated polymers in consumer products \n\n5.2.1 Textiles \u2013 outdoor clothing \n\nFluorinated polymers and sidechain fluorinated polymers are used in the textile industry because of their \nability to create water-, oil- and dirt-repellent surfaces (Kotthoff et al., 2015). An example of this type of \napplication is outdoor clothing made of multiple layers and different types of polymers. These fabrics \ntypically include a membrane made of extended PTFE, which is included in Gore-Tex and similar products. \nThis multiporous layer has high permeability for water vapour but low permeability for water molecules \n(Ebnesajjad, 2017). In addition, sidechain fluorinated polymers are used as finishes in the outer layer of \nfabrics to create water, oil and stain resistance. These finishes, also called DWR treatment, are typically \ncomposed of fluoroalkyl acrylates and (meth)acrylates (Knepper et al., 2014). \n\nOutdoor clothing and other DWR treated textiles are a potential source of PFAS into the environment \n(Holmquist et al., 2016; Knepper et al., 2014). Different routes for environmental contamination of \n(fluorinated) DWR substances are presented in Figure 5.1. High levels of volatile FTOHs, which are emitted \nto the air, have been detected in outdoor clothing (Knepper et al., 2014; Herzke et al., 2012). Another \nroute for PFAS to enter the environment is through washing, for example, the release of fibres coated with \nfluorotelomer-based polymers have been measured during washing (Schellenberger et al., 2019b; \nKnepper et al., 2014). The loss of PFAS from textiles can also occur in the use phase due to wearing and \ntearing. Ultraviolet radiation, high temperatures and humidity have been detected increasing \nperfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) concentrations in textiles due to degradation of DWR polymers such as FTOHs \n(van der Veen et al., 2020; Gremmel et al., 2016). \n\nThe ability of outdoor clothing to repel water typically diminishes after continuous use and repeated \nwashing cycles. Water repellency can be partly regained by using impregnating agents, but these are \nanother potential source of human exposure to PFAS through the inhalation of sprays and their release to \nthe environment. Fluorosilanes and FTOH substances have been detected in impregnating agents for \ntextiles and footwear (Knepper et al., 2014; Noergaard, 2010). Several incidents have been reported in \nEurope where short-term exposure to impregnating agents containing, in most cases, fluorinated polymers \nhave been associated with respiratory illness and other health problems (ECHA, 2017). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Possible mechanisms for loss of chemicals from DWR treated textiles during the use phase. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 42 \n\nSource: Holmquist et al. (2016) \n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend for reducing the use of long-chain sidechain fluorinated polymers \nin textile finishes and other consumer products (18). Substitution alternatives include short-chain sidechain \nfluorinated polymers or even completely fluorine-free finishes. Concerns have been raised, however, due \nto persistence and lack of data on the health effects for short-chain PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019; OECD, \n2013). Non-fluorinated DWR finishes might be a possibility for consumer products such as outdoor apparel \nas similar water-repellent properties can be achieved with non-fluorinated finishes (Hill et al., 2017). Nonfluorinated alternatives, however, do not perform as well as fluorinated ones in repelling oil \n(Schellenberger et al., 2019a; Holmquist et al., 2016) and might not be sufficient for use in, for example, \noccupational protective clothing (Cousins et al., 2019). \n\n5.2.2 Food-contact materials \n\nFood-contact materials (FCM) (19) cover a wide range of materials that may come into contact with food \nduring its production, processing, storage, preparation and serving. Examples include food-production \nequipment and machinery, packaging and kitchen utensils such as non-stick forms and pans. Many of these \nuse fluorinated polymers due to their ability to resist grease and water (Goldenman et al., 2019). Foodcontact materials are regulated in the EU by the framework regulation 1935/2004 on materials and articles \nintended to come into contact with food (EU, 2004). The principle underlying this regulation is that \u201cany \nmaterial or article intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food must be sufficiently inert \nto preclude substances from being transferred to food in quantities large enough to endanger human \nhealth or to bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the food or a deterioration in its \norganoleptic properties\u201d (20). \n\nNon-stick PTFE coatings are used various kitchenware, for example, in frying pans and other utensils \n(Cousins et al., 2019), due to their high chemical and thermal stability as well as oil/water repelling \nproperties. PTFE polymer coatings are considered to be of less concern than fluorinated substances in \npaper and cardboard packaging (21) due to the negligible release of PFAS during use (Bokkers et al., 2019). \nIf, however, they overheat, PFCAs can be emitted from heated PTFE kitchenware surfaces. There have \nbeen incidents of Teflon flu, or polymer fume fever, a medical condition arising from inhaling of PTFE and \nits thermal degradation products during use (Greenberg and Vearrier, 2015). These cases have been largely \nthe result of overheating PTFE-coated cooking equipment and the condition appears to be reversible but \nlong-term health impacts have not been assessed. No information has been published regarding the \nspecific compounds that lead to the flu-like symptoms. There seems to be no risk to human health at \nnormal application temperatures related to PFCA emissions from PTFE coated kitchenware based on \ncurrent tolerable daily intake (TDIs) according to some studies (Schlummer et al., 2015), whereas some \nearlier studies suggest that perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, originating from PFAS residues of the \nmanufacturing process, might be released from non-stick frying pans even at normal cooking \ntemperatures (Sinclair et al., 2007). \n\n \n18 For example, Polartec has announced the elimination of PFAS in its DWR treatments https://www.polartec.com/news/polartec\nannounces-full-use-of-non-pfas-dwr-treatments \n19 https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials_en \n20 Recently the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain published a draft scientific opinion on the risks to human health \n\nrelated to the presence of perfluoroalkyl substances in food (EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, 2020). The draft \nopinion assesses four PFAS, namely PFOA, PFNA, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and PFOS, and recommends a tolerable \nweekly intake (TWI) of 8 nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg) of body weight per week for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS. \n\n21 Various PFAS are used in paper and cardboard packaging materials, for example, plates, popcorn bags, pizza boxes, fast-food \ncontainers and baking papers (Bokkers et al., 2019). Nowadays, typically short-chain fluorotelomer based polymers are used in \npaper and cardboard food-packaging materials (Cousins et al., 2019). PFAS, that are not allowed in food-contact materials, have \nalso been detected, possibly from impurities present in the substances used to treat paper and cardboard (Bokkers et al., 2019). \nPFAS in food-contact materials are a possible source for direct human exposure as PFAS can leach into food resulting in \nincreased dietary exposure. Microwave popcorn consumption, for example, has been associated with increased PFAS serum \nconcentrations, suggesting a leaching from the fluorinated coating of the food packaging (Susmann et al., 2019). \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials_en\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 43 \n\n5.2.3 Cosmetics and personal care products \n\nFluorinated substances are used in various cosmetics and personal care products, such as hair products, \nfoundations and powders in which they act as emulsifiers, antistatics, stabilisers, surfactants, film formers, \nviscosity regulators and solvents, amongst others, and their properties enable the production of water- \nand oil-repellent and weather resistant products (Brinch et al., 2018; Schultes et al., 2018). As a result, \nPFAS are found in cosmetic products as both ingredients and unintentional degradation products and \nimpurities from the production of precursors used in some cosmetic products. Cosmetics products \nincluding polyfluoroalkyl phosphates (PAPs), for example, have been reported to contain high levels of \nPFCAs either as impurities or degradation products of PAPs (Fujii et al., 2013). Foundations and powders \nhave particularly been shown to include perfluorinated carboxylic acids \u2013 perfluoroheptanoic acid and \nperfluorohexanoic acids \u2013and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (Schultes et al., 2018). \n\nA recent risk assessment of cosmetic products on the Danish market showed that a wide variety of \nfluoroalkyl substances and other fluorinated compounds are used in cosmetics, and PTFE was most often \nfound in different product types, followed by C9-15 fluoroalcohol phosphates (Brinch et al., 2018). According \nto the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, for example, PTFE is used in concentrations of up to 13% in such leaveon products as mascara, up to 3% in face powders and at concentrations of up to 2.4% in such rinse-off \nproducts as hair bleaches in the United States (Johnson, 2018b).  Brinch et al. (2018) measured PFAS \nconcentrations in cosmetics products that contained certain fluorinated substances in the ingredients list \nand carried out a risk assessment. Although PFAS were found in almost all products in varying \nconcentrations, it was concluded that measured PFCA concentrations did not pose a risk to consumers, \nalthough risk could not be completely ruled out if several products were used simultaneously (Brinch et \nal., 2018). \n\nDirect human exposure to PFAS from cosmetics occurs through skin contact; studies suggest that, for \nexample, PFOA penetrates human skin (Franko et al., 2012). Several studies reviewed in Sunderland et al. \n(2019) suggest, however, that the contribution of dermal contact to PFAS exposure is negligible when \ncompared to dietary intake, household dust or drinking water contamination. In addition to direct human \nexposure, environmental contamination from cosmetics can occur through wastewater treatment plants, \nbut the magnitude of such contamination is unknown (Goldenman et al., 2019). Pollution from fluorinated \nmicroplastics is briefly discussed in Section 5.4. Due to the risks of PFAS to health and the environment, \nseveral cosmetics brands have announced the phase out of PFAS in their products (Chemsec, 2018, 2019). \n\n5.3 Polytetrafluoroethylene micropowders/microplastics \n\nA large proportion of clean and unfilled PTFE scrap, which mainly originates from machining \noperations, is degraded thermally or by high-energy irradiation in order to radically reduce the molar \nmass of the material and finally create micropowder which is also a microplastic, typically with a \nparticle sized 2\u201320  \u03bcm (Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Lakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). The degradation \naims to reduce the length of the molecular chain to approximately 1% of the original (Pro-K, 2018). \nSuch micropowders can be used over a wide range of temperatures from -190 to 250 \u00b0C to provide \nnon-stick properties, improved lubricity, wear resistance and reinforcement, and are thus mainly \nused as additives in coatings, lubricants, oils, printing inks and plastics (Dams and Hintzer, 2017; \nLakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). These are mainly dispersive uses \nof PTFE microplastics resulting in their release indoors and to the wider environment over time. \n\nThe thermal degradation of PTFE occurs at about 500 \u00b0C in ovens, kneaders or extruders in commercially \nestablished processes. The resulting low-molecular-weight PTFE materials are then milled to \nmicropowders (Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). The degradation by irradiation can be performed by \nelectron beams, X-rays or gamma radiation. Degradation by irradiation is considered such a mature \ntechnique by the United States Food and Drug Administration that the generated micropowders may be \nused as additives in plastics that may come into repeated contact with food (Pro-K, 2018). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 44 \n\nAccording to Lakshmanan and Chakraborty (2015), however, the use of electron beams induces the \ngeneration of gases such as hydrogen fluoride vapour which should be ventilated from processing areas. \nThere is also evidence that other, long-chain PFAS are generated in the process (ECHA, 2015). The \ngeneration of hydrogen fluoride is much less notable in irradiation with gamma rays as the irradiation rate \nis several orders of magnitude less than that of electron beams. According to Makuuchi and Cheng (2011), \nhowever, the majority of irradiation is done using electron beams \u2013 Hintzer and Schwertfeger (2014) state \nthat the degradation of PTFE by electron beam irradiation is \u201ccommercially widely used\u201d by continuous \nprocesses. \n\nAlthough micropowders were first developed as a means of disposing of the PTFE scrap, they are also \nproduced from virgin materials (Ebnesajjad and Morgan, 2019; Lakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). The \nuse of secondary PTFE feedstocks for the generation of micropowder is much more accepted by the costdriven ink market than by other areas, as PTFE scrap is the cheapest source of micropowders. In addition, \nPTFE scrap often contains hydrocarbon contaminants, possibly causing colour defects, which can be less \nof a problem in coloured inks (Ebnesajjad and Morgan, 2019). \n\nIn 2010, the market for irradiated micropowder was assumed to be approximately 7,000\u201310,000 tonnes \nper year, of which the largest share was consumed in the United States. Recycling by irradiation to \nmicropowders has been shown to be a profitable means of adding value to PTFE scrap. About 60\u201370% of \nthe total volume of the world\u2019s PTFE micropowders was processed by companies providing toll irradiation \nservices in the early 2010s, whereas the rest was processed by PTFE manufacturers themselves (Makuuchi \nand Cheng, 2011). \n\n5.4 Microplastic pollutants from the use of fluorinated polymers \n\nAs for common polymers, micro-sized fluorinated polymers can be released either directly into the \nenvironment due to intentional use in products, or indirectly after physical degradation of macro-sized \nfluorinated polymers in products or mismanaged waste. One major intentional use application is in \ncosmetic products, both for leave-on and rinse-off products, as described in Section 5.2.3. It can be \nexpected that a large part of fluorinated polymer-containing cosmetics will be removed from the face \nduring daily cleaning routines, with a considerable share being washed down the drain, thereby entering \nwastewater effluent along with other microplastic particles. Most of today's wastewater treatment plants \n(WWTPs) are unable to remove large parts of the microplastic content from wastewater and, as a result, \nthey are emitted to receiving aqueous bodies. PTFE microplastics use in coatings, lubricants, oils, printing \ninks and plastics, another potential source of fluorinated microplastic pollutants to the environment, is \ndescribed in Section 5.3. \n\nLittle is known about the environmental processes that lead to the accelerated sinking and sedimentation \nof microplastics in aqueous environments. It is not understood, for example, whether or not biofouling \noccurs with fluorinated polymers, as it does with other microplastic types, due to the special chemicalphysical properties of fluorinated polymer surfaces. It can, however, be assumed that the chemical \ninertness and general persistency of fluorinated polymers to environmental degradation and weathering \nwill result in their even slower removal from the environment compared with other common microplastic \nparticles. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 45 \n\n6 End-of-life phase: Waste management and potential emissions of pollutants \n\nMain authors: Margareta Wahlstr\u00f6m, Elina Yli-Rantala, David Behringer, Dorte Herzke, Stephen Mudge \nand Elina Pohjalainen \nContributors: VTT (Recycling; degradation of products in the environment); NILU and \u00d6ko-Recherche \n(Degradation of products in the environment; degradation due to thermal stress) \n\nKey messages: \n\n\u2022 Recycling: \n\n\u2022 A very low percentage of fluorinated polymers is recycled due to their use in a wide range of \napplications and their low share in end-of-life products. \n\n\u2022 Recycling activities are mainly concentrated on production scrap because large amounts of \nwaste are generated during the production of fluorinated polymers. The majority of \nfluorinated polymers from end uses end up in landfill or are incinerated. The barriers to \nrecycling are mostly technical. \n\n\u2022 Thermal treatment: \n\n\u2022 Fluorinated polymers start degrading at relatively low temperatures (> 200 \u00b0C) and up to \napproximately 1 100 \u00b0C after which mineralisation to HF occurs. Which degradation products \nare formed depends on a number of physical and chemical conditions? Examples include \nvolatile and ionic/water-soluble compounds such as TFA; volatile fluorinated gases some of \nwhich are GHG; oligomers; and nano- and micro-particles. Emissions of PFAS are likely to occur \nfrom uncontrolled thermal treatment below 1 100 \u00b0C that does not capture the volatile PFAS. \n\n\u2022 Low temperature heating is used in some processes to strip fluorinated polymers, for instance \nto regenerate metal baking surfaces before recoating them with fluoropolymers, or to strip \nfluoropolymers from lithium-ion batteries to recover metals. Studies, however, do not \nmention or indicate that volatiles including PFAS are captured. \n\n\u2022 Most EU waste incineration occurs at relatively high temperatures, 850\u20131,150 \u00b0C, through \nwhich HF is mostly formed and captured by scrubbers. It is not known if, and to what extent, \nvolatile PFAS are captured. \n\n\u2022 There is no data on PFAS emissions from the thermal degradation (smouldering) of electronic \nand other wastes containing fluorinated polymers, shipped beyond the EU for recycling. \n\n\u2022 Plastic pyrolysis, chemical recycling, at temperature below 600 \u00b0C has been promoted in recent \nyears in the United States and Europe and small-scale plastic pyrolysis of mixed polymer inputs \nis carried out mixed polymer input such countries as India and Pakistan.  It is not known if, and \nto what extent, volatiles are captured. \n\n\u2022 Landfilling: \n\n\u2022 Consumer products containing PFAS have previously been landfilled and it is likely that \nlandfilling still occurs in some EU Member States. \n\n\u2022 Landfill sites may be a source of the very persistent PFAS leaching from impurities in \nfluorinated polymers and from the degradation of fluorinated sidechain polymers. In addition, \nfluorinated non-ionic gasses such as FTOHs may be formed and emitted to the atmosphere. \nEmissions may occur a long time after closure of landfills. \n\n\u2022 Landfill leachates are often treated in wastewater treatment plants which are not designed to \nremove persistent chemicals such as PFAS chemicals. Cost efficient methods are needed to \nreduce PFAS in landfill leachates. \n\n\u2022 There is also lack of harmonised protocols for sampling and analysing leachates. \n\n\u2022 To improve the estimation of long-term impacts, there is a need to better understand key \nfactors influencing the degradation of fluorinated polymers and the leaching mechanisms of \nPFAS in landfills. \n\n\u2022 Discharge of PFAS from fluorinated polymers treated in wastewater treatment plants: \n\n\u2022 There is little information on the influx of fluorinated polymers and emissions of ionic and \nvolatile to air from wastewater treatment plants; \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 46 \n\n\u2022 There is little information on the presence, levels and contributions of fluorinated polymers to \nPFAS in municipal sludge, and how much from households as opposed light industry. This \ninformation is needed to assess the contribution of PFAS from fluorinated polymers to \nagricultural and other soils, treated with wastewater treatment plant sludge. Management of \nurban wastewater treatment plant sludge differs among EU Member States. \n\n6.1 General consideration of waste management \n\nIn Chapter 6, circularity aspects in waste management of fluorinated polymers containing waste is \nanalysed, especially assessing the possibilities to turn the waste management towards circularity. Waste \nmanagement currently tends to rely on a linear economic model of take, make, use and dispose of. In a \nCE, the circularity is ensured in all phases of the lifecycle by maintaining the value of the material and \nproducts in the loop for as long as possible and reducing the escape of resources, thus minimising impacts \nduring different lifecycle stages. Waste landfilling and incineration are avoided as long as possible. \nNonetheless, legislative requirements of waste management need to be followed. \n\nAs previously discussed, fluorinated polymers are used in a wide range of applications, especially in the \ntransport, energy and chemistry sectors, as well as in construction and consumer products (Am\u00e9duri, 2020; \n2018). From a waste management perspective, fluorinated polymers are typically incorporated in products \nsuch as in membranes, O-rings, mantling/covers, coatings, and electric insulators to provide them with \nspecific properties. As a result, it is often not either possible or manageable to separate the thin layers \ncontaining fluorinated polymers. Moreover, when products enter the waste stage depends on their \nlifespans which can vary from just a few months to decades for some products such as cars, photovoltaic \npanels, medical implants, buildings, and electronic equipment. \n\nWaste from consumer products, such as textiles, carpets and furniture containing fluorinated polymers, \nend up in the municipal waste stream. Textiles, which make up around 4% of all municipal solid waste \n(Taylor et al., 2014), are important in this context as they may include fabrics that have been treated with \nor contain membranes of fluorinated polymers, primarily to enhance stain resistance and provide \nwaterproofing. Carpets are also frequently treated with fluorinated polymers to improve their stain \nresistance. \n\nWithin the EU, the vast majority of waste generated by consumers is collected and disposed of centrally \nthrough a range of recycling and other options. The management of municipal waste differs between \nMember States but, on average, 48% was recycled, 29% incinerated and 23% landfilled in 2018 (Eurostat, \n2020). Impacts of incineration and landfilling, particularly of municipal waste, are discussed further in \nSections 6.4 and 6.5. \n\nOpen waste or backyard burning is a relatively rare in Europe (Cogut, 2016). This type of combustion \ntypically occurs with low oxygen availability in a barrel at relatively low temperatures compared to \nregulated municipal incineration sites. In less developed countries and in the rural areas of the United \nStates, for instance, a significant percentage of the total waste generated is incinerated at low \ntemperatures \u2013 Cogut (2016) estimates that 41% of global waste is burned this way. There is a high risk of \nthe release of toxic emissions (dioxins and POPs) in open burning of plastics and electronic waste. \nElectronic waste has in the past been imported in large quantities from developed countries by developing \nones, especially Africa, often for the recovery of valuable metals. \n\nIn the transport sector, applications containing fluorinated polymers typically have long lifespans in \ncontrast to the electronics sector where the lifespans vary depending on the application. Waste arising \nfrom the automotive and electronic sectors typically end up in metal shredding plants and are often \ntreated jointly for the recovery of metals with a high monetary value. In the shredding plants, \nreusable/recyclable plastic fractions \u2013 bumpers, fuel tanks and some plastics from electronics \u2013 are \nremoved prior to shredding. Potentially coated metals and those with tightly attached components are \nsent for metal recovery in high temperature smelters. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 47 \n\nIt is estimated that a typical car contains around 350 grams of fluorinated polymers (Am\u00e9duri, 2018). This \ncorresponds to 4,200 tonnes of fluorinated polymers ending as waste from vehicles in Europe each year, \ngiven that around 12 million vehicles a year are deregistered and sent to waste. Within a few years, the \namount of fluorinated polymers in cars is forecast to increase to 1\u20132 kilograms (Am\u00e9duri, 2020), \nconsiderably increasing the amount of affected waste. In the shredding of vehicles, the plastic fraction, \nexcluding bumpers, fuel tanks and batteries, ends up in the light fraction of the shredder waste, which \nconsists of a mixture of plastics, rubber, wood and other non-metal residuals \u2013 typically around 30% is \nplastics (Zevenhoven and Saeed, 2002). According data from 20 European countries (Eurostat, 2020), \nabout 0.86 million tonnes of shredder waste were treated in 2017 of which 34% was landfilled, 33% \nincinerated with energy recovery and 33% recycled. \n\nIn renewable energy production, fluorinated polymers provide desired functionality to applications. \nWastes from photovoltaic panels are an emerging and growing waste stream after a lifespan of 25\u201330 \nyears (Deng et al., 2019). Backsheets, containing fluorinated polymers, can be peeled off from modules at \nelevated temperatures or can be mechanically separated before the solar cells are recycled, but the \nresidue after the recovery of such valuable metals as aluminium, copper, silver and steel, is for cost reasons \ntypically sent for incineration or landfilled. Section 7.6 presents a comparison of environmental impacts \nfrom waste management of backsheets with fluorine-free and fluorinated polymers. Other energy related \ndevices in which fluorinated polymers play an important role, including fuel cells, rechargeable batteries \nand other applications for energy capture, are now entering the waste stream after 10\u201320 years. The \napplications often contain valuable metals, critical raw materials such as cobalt in lithium-ion batteries and \nplatinum in fuel cells, that are recovered by pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical processes. It is not \nclear to what extent these wastes are exported beyond Europe for metal recovery. \n\nFluorinated polymers are used in numerous electronic applications due to their dielectric properties and \nchemical stability. The share of the fluorinated polymer is, however, typically rather low relative to the \ntotal weight of the application. In addition, not only the small share of fluorinated polymers, but also the \npoor separability of the polymers limits their recyclability. For example, in lithium-ion batteries PVDF, \nwhich is used as a binder in the electrode layer, makes up just 1\u20132 wt% of the total (Mossali et al., 2020). \nThe major driver for recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries is the economic value of metals, cobalt and \nnickel, in the cathode layer, whereas feasibility of recycling of polymers is rather low. As mentioned earlier, \nvarious industrial processes for metal recovery exist combining, for example, pyrometallurgical and \nhydrometallurgical approaches, however details of the processes or pre-treatment methods used by the \nrecycling industry are not widely available. While the formation of harmful decomposition products of the \nbinder and electrolyte, which also contains containing fluoride, is well documented during thermal \nrunaway of the battery cells, gas emissions from recycling processes have received less attention. A \nrecently published study describes the decomposition of PVDF binders starting from 386 \u00b0C with a \nmaximum peak for fluoride-containing gases at 522 \u00b0C (Chen et al., 2019). Attention is thus needed on the \nend-of-life management of the applications to deal with toxic emissions that may be formed in the thermal \ntreatment in certain conditions. \n\nThe risks for uncontrolled emissions at commercial bakeries have been raised up by Lohmann et al. \n(Lohmann et al., 2020). In bakeries, fluoropolymer coatings are regularly removed from baking forms after \n12\u221224 months of use either by burning or blasting, with unknown emissions of PFAS and fluoropolymer \nparticles to air, water, and soil, and then the forms are recoated. In the thermal treatment, the old coating \nis burned off at 450 \u00b0C over 4\u22125 hours, followed by blasting by grit or water at 1 500 bar. \n\nFluorinated polymer products are also used in buildings in, for example, facades and coatings to improve \nwetting properties, and paint or surface treatment applications such as coatings, lacquers, and stains \n(Janousek et al., 2019). Fluorinated polymers may also be used in adhesives for timbers due to their \nultraviolet transparency and beneficial weight-to-surface ratio. Fluorinated polymers can also replace glass \nin solar panels, greenhouses, or buildings\u2019 sunroofs because they have good dirt and water repelling \nproperties. Due to the long lifespans of buildings, the wastes are generated decades after construction \nand it is likely that these types of waste are yet to be removed from buildings. Today, a major concern is \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 48 \n\nthe release of PFAS to the environment near construction sites due to the weathering of products in \ncontact with rainwater. Products from the renovation or demolition of buildings are typically disposed of \nin landfills for mineral wastes. As stony construction waste and metals can largely be recovered to use in \nnew applications, they must be free of pollutants. Coated surfaces are therefore problematic for recovery, \nespecially in high-grade recycling. Fabrics are treated as municipal waste and incinerated or landfilled \ndepending on the country. Releases from construction waste containing PFAS have only been addressed \nin a few articles. \n\nBox 6.1 Focus on hazardous waste and waste containing POPs \n\nWaste is classified as hazardous or non-hazardous. Hazardous waste is a waste that, due to its (intrinsic) \nchemical or other properties poses a risk to the environment and/or human health. The classification is \nprimarily based on the European List of Waste (LoW) (2014/955/EU) or based on a waste\u2019s hazardous \nproperties. In the LoW, wastes are primarily categorised as hazardous, non-hazardous, or potentially \nhazardous/non-hazardous according to their origin or source \u2013 for example, electronic wastes are \nclassed as hazardous whereas textile waste from households are deemed to be non-hazardous. In some \ncases, a particular type of waste on the list can be either hazardous or non-hazardous depending on its \nspecific properties and in these cases the waste status has to be assessed based on its hazardous \nproperties. The European Commission\u2019s Regulations No 1357/2014 and 2017/997 define the hazardous \nproperties for hazardous waste classification referring to assessment methods developed in the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP). For example, the \nhazardous classification limits for the content of PFOS and PFOA in waste are given in Table 6.1. \n\nThe waste classification has several implications. There are numerous EU regulations, including the \nWaste Shipment Regulation (Regulation EC No 1013/2006 and Regulation EU No 660/2014), the Landfill \nDirective (1999/33/EC), the waste acceptance criteria at landfill (Council Decision 2003/33/EC), the \nIndustrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive \n(85/337/EEC), setting special requirements for waste defined as hazardous. The Waste Shipment \nRegulation (WSR) (No. 1013/2006), for example, requires permits for the export or import of hazardous \nwaste both within EU and between the EU and OECD countries outside the EU and bans exports to OECD \ncountries. \n\nThe Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, adopted by the EU Regulation (EU) \n2019/1021 on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which is a revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004, requires \nwastes containing substances listed in Annex IV to the Regulation and exceeding certain concentration \nlimits to be destroyed and not circulated in new products. Products containing POPs may, however, \ncontinue to be used. Both PFOS and PFOA are examples of the POPs (Table 6.1). The list of these \npollutants is continually updated by the addition of new substances. Limits for POPs and hazardous \nwaste classifications differ meaning that wastes containing POPs may be classified as hazardous or nonhazardous depending on whether the hazardous waste limit has been exceeded. Textiles containing \nPOPs, for example, are classified as non-hazardous, and following collection may be sent for recycling if \nnot removed by skilled personnel at waste collection centres. \n\nTable 6.1. Examples of PFOS and PFOA limit values above which the waste is considered as hazardous or as POP \nwaste if either or both are exceeded. \n\nChemical Limit for hazardous waste, mg/kg (Commission \nRegulations No 1357/2014, 2017/997) \n\nLimit for POP waste, mg/kg (Regulation (EU) No 2019/1021 ) \n\nPFOS 3 000 50 (Annex IV) (i) \n\nPFOA 3 000 No limits presented in Annex IV (ii)  \n\ni) Potentially to be revised according to European Commission Staff working paper COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT Poly- and \nperfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 2020 (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/chemicals/2020/10/SWD_PFAS.pdf). \n\nii) Annex I of POP regulation: prohibition (with specific exemptions) on manufacturing, placing on the market and use if limits exceeding: \n0.025 mg/kg for PFOA and any of its salts, 1 mg/kg for each PFOA-related compound and a combination of PFOA-related compounds, \n20 mg/kg for PFOA-related compounds in substances as a transported isolated intermediate for the manufacture of fluorochemicals \nwith a carbon chain of no more than 6 atoms and 1 mg/kg for PFOA and its salts in PTFE micropowders produced by specific techniques, \nas well as mixtures and articles for industrial and professional uses containing PTFE powder. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/chemicals/2020/10/SWD_PFAS.pdf\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 49 \n\n6.2 Recycling \n\nAcross the world, 60% of fluorinated polymers in products is currently landfilled, and 12% are incinerated \n(Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Geyer et al., 2017; Hintzer and Schwertfeger, 2014). Of the remaining 28% only \na minor part is recycled. \n\nContrary to most other plastics, there is a notable economic incentive in recycling fluoroplastics due to \ntheir high value and stability (Ebnesajjad and Khaladkar, 2005). Recycling activities are, however, mainly \nconcentrated on scrap from production and manufacturing, which generate large amounts of fluorinated \npolymer wastes (Schlipf and Schwalm, 2014). This is especially the case for the manufacturing of semifinished parts and end-use articles made of PTFE, the processing steps, such as moulding, sintering, \nmachining and cutting, which usually produce 10\u201330% waste and in some cases more than 50% (Dams and \nHintzer, 2017). If 10\u201330% waste is assumed for all uses of PTFE and its annual global production is taken \nas the 2015 figure of 140 000 tonnes (Chapter 2), global PTFE process waste would be in the range 14 000\u2013\n42 000 tonnes. For Europe, with a production capacity of 52 000 tonnes of fluorinated polymers per year, \nmostly consisting of PTFE, process wastes would be 5 200\u201315 600 tonnes annually. \n\nThe barriers for recycling of fluorinated polymers in products are mostly technical: a major part of the enduse of fluorinated polymers is scattered over a variety of uses in often complex products. In these, the \namount of fluorinated polymers is often low compared to other materials, and dedicated recovery is \ntherefore not put in place for the variety of products. It may also be difficult to collect some products for \nrecycling, such as wire and cable insulation, printed circuit boards in electronics, seals and hoses from the \ntransport sector, coatings of metal surfaces in various areas, medical applications such as ligament \nreplacements, coated fabrics and films for buildings and windmill wings, additives in inks and lubricants, \nand tubing and valves in the chemical and semiconductor industry (Am\u00e9duri, 2020). Given that the global \nrecycling rate of all plastics is approximately 9% (Geyer et al., 2017), it can safely be assumed that the \nrecycling rate of end-of-life fluorinated polymers is substantially lower. \n\nThis study did not find examples of full-scale recycling of fluorinated polymers themselves. However, from \none type of fluoropolymer production, a synthesis by-product is captured and sold for use as a refrigerant \n(United Nations Environment Programme, 2018). Studies conducted in laboratories or small-scale kilns do, \nhowever, indicate that wastes containing PFAS, when mixed together with calcium, will form CaF2, which \nis incorporated into cement and as such is recycled (Section 6.5). Whether the levels captured are high \nenough to make fluorine extraction worthwhile depends on many factors such as the efficiency and cost \nof the extraction compared to virgin materials, and also how critical the supply of fluorine becomes, which \nis not assessed in this report. \n\n6.2.1 Mechanical recycling \n\nMost melt-processable fluoroplastics, such as PVDF, can be recycled in a similar way to other commodity \nthermoplastics, that is, by re-melting through extrusion (Drobny, Jiri G., 2017; Ebnesajjad and Khaladkar, \n2005). There are companies carrying out PVDF recycling in the United States (22,23,24) and Europe (25,26,27), \nand at least one of the major fluoroplastic producers has, in 2013, released a range of PVDF products based \non recycled PVDF scrap. The scrap originates from their own production process, as well as from postmoulding processes at their customers\u2019 sites (Solvay, 2013). \n\nPTFE scrap, such as shavings and machine cuttings, is recycled by different methods from conventional \nthermoplastics because it does not melt when heated, but only softens at temperatures above 327 \u00b0C and \ntherefore, re-melting by extrusion cannot be used. Instead, PTFE scrap can be ground into fine powder \n\n \n22 https://www.polycleantech.com/pvdf/ \n23 https://powerplasticrecycling.com/pvdf-plastic/ \n24 http://www.prsei.com/recycling/material/30-pvdf \n25 https://www.mcam.com/en/recycling-solutions/ \n26 https://repolymer.de/?lang=en \n27 https://www.m-chemical.co.jp/en/news/2020/1208424_7667.html \n\nhttps://www.polycleantech.com/pvdf/\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 50 \n\nand sintered under pressure in compression moulding, or used in ram extrusion (Drobny and Jiri, 2017; \nLakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). Before grinding, the scrap is usually shredded and heated to remove \nany volatile contaminants. After grinding, the powder is treated with acids, such as a mixture of nitric and \nperchloric acids, to dissolve inorganics, after which it is washed (Ebnesajjad and Morgan, 2019; \nLakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). \n\nThe recycled PTFE powder cannot be used for the same applications as virgin PTFE since it cannot be \nmoulded in a similar fashion. Furthermore, it is off-white, which also decreases its value. Recycled PTFE \nhas, however, certain advantages over its virgin equivalent, such as better wear resistance (Lakshmanan \nand Chakraborty, 2015). The use of micropowder PFTE is also discussed in Section 5.3 and microplastic \npollutants from the use of fluorinated polymers in Section 5.4. \n\nIn industrial terms, in its recycled form PTFE is known as reprocessed or repro PTFE, or mechanical grade \nPTFE. Most commonly, the recycled powder is mixed with virgin PTFE and used in cost-driven applications \nin which high purity is not required, such as in non-critical chemical, electrical and mechanical applications. \nIt is not the choice for pharmaceutical, food-contact materials, cosmetics or medical applications \n(Lakshmanan and Chakraborty, 2015). \n\nThe recycling route described above only exists for unfilled, or virgin, PTFE. In contrast, there is a lack of \nlarge-scale recycling technologies for PTFE compounds. This primarily results from the presence of a large \nvariety of different fillers, such as glass fibre, graphite, carbon, metal compounds, ceramics and pigments \nin variable concentrations (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). \n\nWhereas recycling of production scrap takes place, recycling of fluorinated polymers from industrial or \ncommercial applications is challenging. A pilot-scale study (Rubino et al., 2021) has been conducted in Italy \nfocussing on mechanical recycling of the backsheet polymer (PVF based film \u2013 Tedlar) from photovoltaic \npanels and also the thermal recovery of valuable metals. It was demonstrated that the polymer can be \neffectively separated from the milled coarse fraction of end-of-life photovoltaic modules (>3 mm) using a \ncyclohexane solvent treatment and subsequent filtration operation for recovery of the Tedlar fraction. For \nan optimised process, it was estimated that 4.3 kg of polymer of high purity can be recovered from 100 kg \nof input material of milled photovoltaic panels. The applicability of the recovered polymer was not part of \nthe study. The authors also emphasise that the recovery process prevents the release of toxic components \nfrom the fluoropolymer backsheet in thermal metal recovery. \n\n6.2.2 Pyrolysis \n\nDepolymerisation by pyrolysis, also referred to as high-temperature conversion (HTC), is effectively the \nonly recycling method applicable to end-of-life fluoroplastic components. In this, fluoroplastics are \ndecomposed into their monomers at temperatures above 600 \u00b0C in the absence of oxygen (Dams and \nHintzer, 2017; Schlipf and Schwalm, 2014). In 2015, the chemical company Dyneon commissioned a pilot \npyrolysis plant that claimed to be the first fluorinated polymer up-cycling facility in the world. Up-cycling \nrefers to recycling in which the material quality is improved rather than downgraded. The plant was \nconstructed in Germany and it has a capacity of treating 500 tonnes of fluorinated polymer waste per year \n(PlastEurope, 2015). Suitable materials for Dyneon\u2019s pyrolysis process include the perfluorinated polymers \nPTFE, PFA and FEP, even with mineral fillers, and it is claimed to produce the monomers TFE and HFP with \na recovery rate of 90\u201395% (Dams and Hintzer, 2017; Schlipf and Schwalm, 2014). It is claimed that each \ntonne of TFE produced by the HTC process saves 5 tonnes of Cl, 10 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 1.6 tonnes \nof CaF2, 2 tonnes of sulphuric acid and 10 tonnes of CO2 emissions (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). \n\nIn addition, pyrolysis of mixed plastics to produce fuel has occurred in recent decades in the United States \nand Asian countries using carpets and auto-shredder residue as feedstocks (OCEAN RECOVERY ALLIANCE, \n2015; 4R Sustainability, Inc, 2011), which may contain fluorinated polymers. Furthermore, plastic pyrolysis \nplants are operated in developing countries with mixed plastic inputs for fuel production (Banu et al., 2020; \nBeston, 2020). These pyrolysis plants are normally operated at temperatures below 650 \u00b0C in which the \nthermal degradation of fluorinated polymers result in toxic emissions including toxic nano- and \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 51 \n\nmicroparticles (Boucher et al., 2000; Seidel et al., 1991; Waritz, 1975) and such PFAS as PFOA (Ochi et al., \n2008). There is no published study that assesses pilot and full-scale pyrolysis processes for PFAS and other \ntoxic degradation products from fluorinated polymer degradation. \n\n6.3 Emissions of PFAS to water, soil and air from wastewater treatment plants \n\nEmissions of PFAS from wastewater treatment plants have been studied to some extent, mostly the \nreleases of PFAAs into water and less for releases to air and its content in sludge. In this chapter the overall \nprocesses are described but not in great detail. Also, a broad range of ionic PFAS are detectable in \nwastewater treatment plant effluents, but a direct link to fluorinated polymer production and use might \nbe overshadowed by the plethora of alternative PFAS emission sources. \n\nWastewater treatment plants are classified by regulation as urban and industrial facilities and are referred \nto as urban and industrial wastewater treatment plants respectively. In both, influent water is treated and \nthe effluent wastewater is let into surface or marine waters. \n\nDuring the treatment process, PFAS processing agents, impurities and degradation products, as well as the \nfluorinated polymers themselves, may be released to air, water or be precipitated into the plant\u2019s sludge. \nThe partially or non-degraded fluorinated polymers may be present in solution or dispersion or be in the \nform of nano- or microplastics. \n\nThe PFAS degradation products will distribute into different media depending on their physical-chemical \ncharacteristics: \n\n\u2022 Air: volatile degradation products, such as FTOHs, FTSs and potentially other small PFAS volatiles \nsuch as fluoroform (CHF3). It has been shown that FTOHs have air residual times of more than 20 \ndays, which makes them long range transboundary air pollutants. Indeed, emissions of FTOHs have \nbeen shown to be a source of the PFAAs in the Arctic (D\u2019eon and Mabury, 2011). Neutral (nonionic) \nand ionic PFAS may be emitted to air, both in the gas-phase and through aerosols. A number of \nvolatile per- and polyfluorinated compounds have been detected in the air above the influent of \nselected wastewater treatment plants (Coggan et al., 2019). Atmospheric emissions dominate \nFTOHs emissions from wastewater treatment plants but emissions to the aquatic environment \nhave been shown to be significant during seasons with less wind in a study conducted near Beijing \n(Chen et al., 2020). \n\n\u2022 Water: short-chain and water soluble PFAAs, such as PFCAs and PFTCAs which are the \nintermediate transformation products from 6:2 FTOH sidechain polymers, such as 5:3 \nfluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 FTCA) (Coggan et al., 2019). Additionally, PFPEs used in \nfluoropolymers such as GenX, F-53B and Adona will partition to the water phase. Several of these \nare or form persistent and mobile chemicals. \n\n\u2022 Sludge: nano- and microplastic fluoropolymers, fluorinated sidechain polymers in dispersion or \nadhering to particulate matter such as dust or textile and paper fibres, and long-chain PFAS (PFAAs \nand other PFAS) that have low or no water solubility will end up in the sludge. All neutral (nonionic) \nPFAS that are not volatile will partition to the sludge. \n\n6.3.1 Urban wastewater treatment plants \n\nPFAS from fluorinated polymers in urban wastewater treatment plants come from both households and \nfrom light industry. Which contributes the most varies depending on the number and type of smaller \nindustry in the catchment area using these chemicals. A study conducted in Sweden in 2014\u20132015 suggests \nthat levels of total organofluorine and unidentified PFAS in wastewater treatment plant sludge are more \nrelated to types of industry rather than the number of households connected to the plants in that area \n(Yeung et al., n.d.). A review summarising the occurrence of PFAS in water and wastewater environments \nshows very large differences in various PFAS concentrations in wastewater influents/effluents which was \nexplained by the origin of wastewater from either domestic, or PFAS non-intensive or intensive industrial \nwastewater (Phong Vo et al., 2020). Wastewater treatment plants downstream of the aqueous fire\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 52 \n\nfighting foam (AFFF) industry and firefighting training grounds, for example, receive high PFAS \nconcentrations. A monitoring study conducted in Italy in 2010\u20132013 investigating the occurrence of PFAA \nin the aqueous environment and drinking water concluded that wastewater treatment plants receiving \nindustrial wastes discharged up to 50 times the PFAA loads of plants receiving municipal wastes (Castiglioni \net al., 2015). \n\nWhile there are studies investigating release of PFAS from fluorinated sidechain polymers in textiles, there \ndo not seem to be studies specifically looking at how much fluorinated polymers contribute to PFAS levels \ncompared to fluorinated non-polymers. Examples of household sources are the release of PFAS from \nfluorinated sidechain polymers from washing textiles, dust and fibres on coated furniture, floor and \nsurface polishes and spreading agents in detergents and excretion after human ingestion. Another possible \nsource is recycled toilet paper, since recycled paper for food contact has been shown to contain PFAS from \nsizing and coatings, although there do not seem to be studies of toilet paper as a potential source of these \nchemicals. All types of fluorinated polymers used by light industry could be emitted (Gl\u00fcge et al., 2020). \nExamples of sources include textile, glass, wood and steel coating manufacturers; commercial printers; \nand paint and electronics manufacturers as well as the use of detergents and food companies. Another \nsource could be run-off from urban areas and roads into the water sewage system. Other sources could \nbe the result of abrasion of buildings, products and vehicles as well as from industrial uses and leaks, which \ncould contain both fluorinated polymers and fluoropolymer nano- and microplastics. \n\nUrban wastewater treatment plants are classified as having primary, secondary and tertiary watertreatment processes. The primary process is a simple sedimentation of particulate matter from the water; \nsecondary treatment involves sedimentation and filtration typically through sand or soil; while tertiary \ntreatment involves sedimentation, filtration and biological degradation. All processes can also involve \naeration of the water. None of these traditional wastewater treatments \u2013 coagulation, flocculation, \nsedimentation, micro/ultrafiltration, oxidation (chlorination, ozonation and advanced oxidation processes \n[AOPs]) and UV irradiation \u2013 however, are designed to degrade persistent chemicals, meaning that, \ntypically, urban wastewater treatment plants do not remove PFAS from water or sludge (CMD Smith, \n2020). Full-scale conventional treatment, including coagulation followed by physical separation processes, \nand chemical oxidation, aeration and disinfection, has, for example, been reported ineffective at removing \nPFAS such as PFSAs and PFCAs (Appleman et al., 2014). \n\nActivated carbon adsorption, ion exchange and high pressure membrane processes (nanofiltration and \nreverse osmosis) may be more effective treatment technologies for PFAS removal from water (CMD Smith, \n2020; Franke, 2020). These techniques have been shown effective for the removal of various PFAS in \ndrinking water production (Franke et al., 2021), however their implementation on wastewater effluents is \nchallenged due to the high total organic carbon content (CMD Smith, 2020). Advanced oxidation and \nreduction processes are also much researched for PFAS removal from water, but mostly at a laboratory \nscale and their full potential is yet to be evaluated (Ahmed, 2020). \n\nAs the removal of PFAS from the wastewater effluents and sewage sludge is poor, wastewater treatment \nplants are significant point sources for PFAS emissions to the environment. Studies from all over the world \nexist, in which PFAS levels are measured in wastewater effluents and sludge. In a recent study conducted \nin Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, for example, 99 \nconventional and emerging PFAS were screened in various environmental samples including wastewater \ntreatment plant effluents and sludge. Effluent samples contained a mix of PFAS classes including PFCAs, \nPFSAs, ultrashort PFAS (mainly perfluoropropionic acid [PFPrA]) and PFCA precursors in a concentration \nrange 34\u2013113 ng/l (K\u00e4rrman et al., 2019). Sludge samples, on the other hand, were dominated by PFCA \nprecursors, on average accounting for 75% of all identified PFAS, and mainly contributed by different \nisomers of polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters (diPAPs). The study highlighted the low level of \nidentified PFAS when compared to the total extractable organic fluorine (EOF) in wastewater treatment \nplant effluents and sludge. Another example is an Australian study which analysed 21 different PFAS in \naqueous and solid samples from nineteen treatment plants (Coggan et al., 2019). The mean concentration \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 53 \n\nof 21 PFAS measured in aqueous samples was 110 nanograms28 per litre (ng/l), which results in a rough \nestimate of 339 kg of PFAS discharged per year from Australian wastewater treatment plants in effluents. \nAs in many previous studies, concentrations of some compounds (perfluoropentanoic acid [PFPeA], \nperfluorohexanoic acid [PFHxA], perfluoroheptanoic acid [PFHpA], PFOA, PFNA, and perfluorodecanoic \nacid [PFDA]) increased significantly between influent and final effluent due to the degradation of \nprecursors to stable PFAAs. \n\nTable 6.2 presents an overview on findings of selected European monitoring studies for PFAS in \nwastewater treatment plant effluents/sludges conducted in 2008\u20132018. \n\nTable 6.2. Main findings of selected PFAS monitoring studies related to releases from wastewater treatment plants in \nEurope. \n\nLocation Main findings in the studies Reference \n\nNordic countries (Denmark, \nFaroe Islands, Finland, \nGreenland, Iceland, Norway \nand Sweden), 2016\u20132017 \n\n99 PFAS were screened in various environmental samples and \ncompared to the total extractable organic fluorine (EOF) content. \nDetected average total PFAS concentration were 34\u2013113 ng/l in \neffluents and 36.8\u2013142 ng/g in sludge samples. The target analysis \nof PFAS could explain 9 % of the measured EOF for plant sludge and \n11% for plant effluents, \n\n(K\u00e4rrman et al., \n2019) \n\nBelgium (Wallonia and the \nBrussels Capital Region), 2015\u2013\n2018 \n\nEnvironmental monitoring study in Wallonia and the Brussels Capital \nRegion on a multitude of hazardous substances, including several \nPFAS. For surface water measurements from wastewater treatment \nplants, PFHxS and PFOA were detected in all samples; PFHpA and \nPFOS were found in 95 % of all samples; and PFSHxs was found in \n60% of them. The sum of these PFAS on average did not exceed 50 \nng/l in the samples, with the exception of samples from Louvain-laNeuve treatment plant. \n\n(Frippiat et al., \n2018) \n\nNorway, 2017\u20132018 Organic pollutants including 22 PFAS were analysed in sludge \nsamples from 18 treatment plants. PFAS were detected in all \nsamples, the average value 40 \u03bcg/kg TS, while the mean was 25.2 \n\u03bcg/kg TS. Treatment plants receiving wastewater from airports had \nhigher values of PFAS than others. \n\n(Blytt and Stang, \n2018) \n\nSweden, 2012\u20132015 Samples from three treatment plants were analysed for PFAS and \nprecursor compounds. 41 PFAS compounds analysed: The \u03a3PFAS \nconcentrations were in the range 29.8\u201377.0 ng/l in the effluent \nwater. Precursor compounds made a significant contribution to the \ntotal amount of PFAS. \n\n(Eriksson et al., \nn.d.) \n\nSweden, 2018\u20132019 The presence of PFAS and their potential degradation/reduction in \nsludge in different treatments was studied. Decreasing trends for \nconcentrations could be observed in composted sludge over the \nstorage time while the non-composted showed variable time trends \nfor different substance classes. For PFAS, the sum concentrations of \ntarget analytes increased by almost an order of magnitude during 12 \nmonths of storage in the non-composted sludge. Furthermore, the \nresults from Total Oxidizable Precursors (TOP) and EOF analyses \nfurthermore suggested that the sludge from both treatment \nexperiments contained a significant fraction PFAS that could not be \nquantified by the targeted analysis. \n\n(Giovanoulis et al., \n2020) \n\nGermany, 2008\u20132013 4 981 sludge samples from 1 165 different treatment plants were \nanalysed between 2008 and 2013 for 11 PFAA compounds. \nContamination of analysed PFAAs in sewage sludge clearly \ndecreased due to phase out of long chain PFAAs, but the decrease of \ntotal flux of PFAS was not verified. Very high PFAA concentrations in \nsewage sludge were detected related to firefighting foams \ncontaining PFAAs or emissions from industries using PFAAs. \n\n(Ulrich et al., 2016) \n\n \n\n \n28 nanogram (10\u22129 grams) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 54 \n\nSewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants may be applied to agricultural fields, incinerated, or \nsent to landfills for disposal (Stoiber et al., 2020). In the majority of European countries, sludge is used as \na fertiliser on soil, indeed in some Member States more than 80% of urban wastewater treatment plant \nsludge ends up on the land. Currently there are no EU criteria for organic contaminants in fertilisers or in \nsoil, and hence no limit values for PFAS or legal obligation to monitor for them in urban wastewater \ntreatment plant sludge. EU Member States may have set their own criteria, in Denmark, for instance the \namount of 12 PFAS in soil is limited to 400 \u00b5g/kg dry matter soil (DK EPA, 2015). In Europe and the United \nStates urban wastewater treatment plant sludge has caused contamination of soil, water and crops. In \nEurope this has been documented in the EU research project PERFOOD (2008\u20132012) (29), and in later \nresearch and national publications from, amongst others the Netherlands and Sweden. The EU also funded \nthe NonHazCities (30) regional study on PFAS emissions from cities to the Baltic Sea which demonstrated \nthat these chemicals are released from households to urban wastewater treatment plants. \n\nOnce PFAS containing sludge is applied on soil, these compounds may bioaccumulate in plants. The plant \nuptake depends on various factors, but particularly shorter chain PFAS seem to accumulate in leaves and \nfruit, whereas higher chain PFAS tend to be more concentrated in roots (Costello and Lee, 2020; Ghisi et \nal., 2019). Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and PFPeA have been detected in lettuce and tomatoes grown in \nsoil to which biosolids had been applied (Blaine et al., 2013). It is difficult to treat wastewater sludge and \nremove PFAS due to its complex nature. Information on treatment of PFAS contaminated soils is scarce, \nwhereas numerous reviews on PFAS removal from aqueous environments are available. Currently \navailable methods for remediation of PFAS contaminated soils seem to be expensive, impractical for in situ \ntreatment, use high pressure and temperatures, and/or result in toxic waste (Shahsavari et al., 2021). A \nvariety of remediation technologies have been introduced at a laboratory scale such as chemical oxidation, \nball milling, and electron beams, however, additional research is needed to make them feasible, costeffective and applicable in the field. \n\n6.3.2 Industrial wastewater treatment plants \n\nDetection of volatile PFAS in air above industrial effluent wastewaters show that they are emitted in the \nproduction/manufacturing processes (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). This is also confirmed, for example, by the \nFood Contact Substance Notifications which reported that United States Food and Drug Administration \nhas approved fluorinated acrylic polymers for use in coating food-contact paper and board (EDF, 2018) \nand noted that 88% was retained on the paper with 4% going to wastewater and 8% to sludge. Compared \nto their urban equivalents, industrial wastewater treatment plants typically have more developed \ntreatments for the removal chemicals from water, with the sludge going for incineration or landfilling. \nThere are, however, several instances in both Europe and the United States of widespread pollution from \ntreatment plants, the most well known of which concern fluoropolymer facilities in the United States such \nas DuPont (now Chemours) and 3M manufacturing sites. Here PFOA used as a dispersion agent (polymer \nproduction aid) in PTFE was emitted to lakes, rivers, soil and groundwater through wastewater treatment \nplants, landfills and emissions to the air. The contamination led to widespread pollution of the surrounding \ncommunities and livestock as well as the wider environment resulting in court cases that were settled by \npayments totalling more than US$ 700 million. Both in the United States and Europe sludge mixed into \nbiosolids as soil improvers have been spread on farmland and has thereby contaminated the environment, \ncrops, drinking water, people and livestock. The best-documented case concerned the German district of \nRastatt where papermill sludge contaminated with PFAS was mixed into a soil improver \u2013 the exact type \nof chemical and whether a polymeric or non-polymeric PFAS was used remains uncertain. Contamination \nfrom a paper factory was also recently discovery in Tyrifjord, Norway (Langberg et al., 2021). In both cases \nthe presence of PFOS indicates that non-polymeric surfactants might have been used, but the exact PFAS \ntype and its source remains unknown. \n\n \n29 PERFOOD: https://ibed.fnwi.uva.nl/perfood/index.html \n30 NonHazCity: https://thinkbefore.eu/en/ \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 55 \n\nIn summary, studies are scarce on both the fraction of PFAS from fluorinated polymers that are released \nto air, water and sludge and the extent to which they have and are contaminating soil, water and crops \nthrough the application of urban wastewater treatment plant sludge. \n\nThe EU Chemical Strategy for Sustainability and its European Commission\u2019s supporting PFAS Staff Working \nDocument call for the inclusion of PFAS in the recast of the Fertiliser Directive. This may provide an option \nto determine the amounts of both specific and total PFAS in wastewater treatment plant sludge from both \nurban and industrial sources. The recommended inclusion of these chemicals in the revision of the \nEuropean Pollutant Release and Transfer Register may also provide more information and better control \nof PFAS emitted from industrial and urban wastewater treatment plants. Given the diversity of these \nchemicals, effective control may require limit values and monitoring of all PFAS as well as specific ones. \nThe comprehensive screening of PFAS is challenging due to the large number of different PFAS. One \nmethod proposed to investigate unknown PFAS is to measure the total EOF in addition to targeted PFAS \nin a sample (K\u00e4rrman et al., 2019). \n\n6.4 Landfilling of wastes from fluorinated polymer production and end-of-life products \n\n6.4.1 Management of waste from fluorinated polymer production and products \n\nIn the production of fluorinated polymers, wastes containing PFAS are generated but very little \ninformation is available in scientific literature about their management. A Dutch study (Gebbink and van \nLeeuwen, 2020) mentions that at the Chemour plant in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, 50% of GenX ends up \nin the waste streams and is sent to a nearby incineration plant. In Europe, waste containing PFAS are \nclassified as hazardous if their PFAS content exceeds a substance specific limit value (Box 6.1). According \nto Council Decision 2003/33/EC, hazardous wastes may only be disposed of at hazardous waste landfills if \nthe waste acceptance criteria are met; for example, low organic content measured as loss of ignition not \nexceeding 10% at 550 oC. Since the landfill legislation came into force, organic hazardous process residues \nare incinerated rather than disposed of in landfills. \n\nIn the past, wastes from organofluorine industries were disposed of in landfills resulting in associated \nreleases (Oliaei et al. 2013). These old landfill sites need particular assessment. In Switzerland, for example, \nlandfills in which the pharmaceutical and pesticide industries disposed of their waste for decades have \nbeen excavated and, according to an internet source (31), the materials removed sent for further treatment \nand destruction. \n\n6.4.2 Emissions of PFAS from the landfilling of end-of-life products \n\nSince 2016, most European countries have introduced restrictions on landfilling waste which have \ngenerally been implemented in Member States as bans on landfilling specific waste streams such as plastic, \ntextiles and carpet wastes, and these wastes are increasingly incinerated. Furthermore, the revised Waste \nFramework Directive has set a target for reducing the amount of municipal waste sent to landfills of 10% \nof total waste by 2035. According to Eurostat data, in the member and cooperating countries of the \nEuropean Environment Agency in 2006, 44% of municipal waste was disposed of in landfills, but by 2017 \nthis had fallen to 23%. Nonetheless, in 18 of the 38 countries, corresponding to 33% of the European \npopulation, landfill rates were more than 50% in 2017 (Figure 6.1). \n\n \n31 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfol; accessed May 28, 2021 \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfol\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 56 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Landfill rates in member and cooperating countries of the European Environment Agency, 2006 and 2017, \n%. \n\nSource: EEA (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/municipal-waste-landfill-rates-in#tab-chart_1) \n\nIn landfill conditions, waste containing PFAS will decompose and release them (Lang et al., 2017; 2016a). \nMany of these substances occur in soluble form; anionic PFOA, for example, is highly soluble, and are \ntherefore likely to be released into the percolating water in the landfill as leachate. As discussed in Chapter \n4, neutral, volatile PFAS, such as FTOH, can be released by sidechain fluorinated polymers as breakdown \nproducts. As only a few articles on release behaviour of PFAS from specific waste types in landfill conditions \nare available, there is still lack of information on the release mechanism and factors influencing their \nbehaviour and potential transformation in landfill conditions. One study showed that in an anaerobic \nlandfill reactor a contact time of more than 100 days was needed before PFAS are released in measurable \nconcentrations from carpet and clothing (Lang et al., 2016b). The results indicate that carpet and clothing \nare likely sources of PFAS in landfill leachate in the United States (Knutsen et al., 2019; Lang et al. 2017; \n2016). \n\nLeachates and sediments from a Norwegian landfill were analysed for PFAS (Eggen et al., 2010). Results \nindicated a potential for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to facilitate transport of fluorinated compounds. \nPFCA substances up to perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDcA) have been detected in the water phase, while \nPFDcA, perfluoroundecanic (PFUnA), perfluorododecanic (PFDoA) and perfluorotridecanic acids (PFTrA) \nwhere detected in sludge; this has also been reported elsewhere including in a Danish study by Bossi et al. \n(2008). Leachate, particularly from organic waste at municipal landfills, contains high concentrations of \nDOC due to the degradation of organic matter. \n\nIn the Norwegian study (Eggen et al., 2010), particular concern was raised about the high concentrations \nof PFAS, up to 6 231 ng/l, in the leachate from landfills. Furthermore, several PFAS, such as long-chained \nPFCAs not detected in either water or particle phases in leachates, were in some cases found in relatively \nhigh concentrations in sediments taken from treatment systems of landfill leachates. A potential \nexplanation is that they were formed during the transformation of perfluorinated precursors. Precursors \nare compounds, both known and unknown, which have the potential to form perfluorinated compounds \n(PFCAs and PFSAs) (Houtz and Sedlak, 2012) at degradation. \n\nIn an Australian study (Gallen et al., 2017), some general trends in leachate characteristics were observed: \nhigher concentrations were found in operating landfills for municipal waste compared to closed ones. \nLandfills that also accepted construction and demolition waste generated higher concentrations of PFHxA \nand PFHpA than purely municipal waste landfills. Both PFHxA and PFHpA are minor impurities in \ncommercial PFOS and PFOA formulations, and potentially precursor chemicals released in landfill \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/municipal-waste-landfill-rates-in#tab-chart_1\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 57 \n\nconditions or PFOA alternatives. Also elevated DOC content and increased acidity in leachate were linked \nto higher leachate concentrations. \n\nThe released PFAS are transported in water to the bottom of the landfill from where leachates are \ncollected and typically sent to wastewater treatment plants prior to their discharge into surface water \nbodies. Part of the leachate may however escape to groundwater without undergoing treatment, \nespecially from old, unlined landfills. Articles on leachate composition from landfills still in operation are \navailable in the literature, although PFAS compounds are also released from closed landfills, even if the \namount of leachate is reduced. \n\nThe discharge of PFAS to the environment can be roughly estimated based on total leachate volumes and \naverage concentration in the leachate. Table 6.3 summarises PFAS discharges reported in some recent \nstudies, with further calculations showing discharges per person and per year. Contrary to expectation, \nthe release reported from landfills in Spain, which has a high landfill rate, was significantly lower than in \nNorway and Sweden. The specific substances and the number of substances measured should, however, \nbe taken into account in the comparison of the data \u2013 the sum results from German study, for example, \ncannot be directly compared to results from other countries. Furthermore, there might be differences in \nanalytical procedures \u2013 for example, threshold values for analysis or filtration of samples prior to analysis \nthat might reduce the concentration. Furthermore, PFAS precursors and their degradation products should \nbe included in the analytical programme in order to avoid their underestimation and comparisons ideally \nmade on substance basis. According to a Norwegian study (Knutsen et al., 2019), 3.5% of PFOA is estimated \nto be released from municipal landfills. \n\nA total yearly release of PFAS from municipal landfills in Europe can be roughly calculated assuming that \nall countries\u2019 annual releases per person are of the same magnitude as Spain, which has higher landfill \nrates than most European countries. This would suggest total annual releases of 430 kg of PFAS from \nmunicipal landfills in 37 European countries (calculated based on population in the countries included in \nFig. 6.132). If, however, all countries have releases similar to Sweden\u2019s, then Europe\u2019s total annual releases \nfrom landfills would increase significantly to 3.7 tonnes. \n\nIt needs to be stressed that this does not include releases from landfills in which the organofluorine \nindustry (Oliaei et al., 2013) or such users of PFAS as the plating or paper industries dispose of their waste. \nThe release from such landfills are likely higher (Oliaei et al., 2013). \n\nTable 6.3 Discharge to the environment of PFAS by landfill leachate reported in some studies. \n\nNote: the table also includes information on landfill rates per country \n\nCountry  \n(source) \n\nLandfill rate \n(year) \n\nEstimated \ndischarge per \n\nyear \n\nCalculated \nannual \n\ndischarge per \nperson (mg) \n\nComment \n\nGermany  \n(Busch et al., \n2010) \n\n< 1 % \n(2006, 2017) \n\nAround 90 \nkg/year for 55 \nPFAS (calculated \namount in treated \nleachate from \nabout 1 700 \nlandfills) \n\n \n\n1 000 \n\nSamples of treated and untreated leachate from \n22 landfill sites in Germany were analysed for 43 \nPFAS.

(2019); Busch et al. (2010) \n\nThe need for further information on emissions of semi-volatile PFAS compounds from landfills has been \nbrought up in Canada (Hamid et al., 2018). In Europe, municipal landfills are generally covered by sealing \nlayers after closure and therefore emissions to air from these semi-volatile PFAS compounds are assumed \nnot to be significant in closed European landfills. \n\nLandfill sites, at least in those studied in Ireland (Harrad et al., 2020), had similar atmospheric \nconcentrations of PFOA and related compounds both up- and downwind suggesting these landfill sites are \nnot a significant source of these compounds to the atmosphere. This corroborates information obtained \nin Germany where only the volatile non-ionic per- and polyfluorinated compounds were found to be \nenriched in the atmosphere near landfills (Weinberg et al., 2011). General German domestic waste \ncontains 0.01\u20130.035% fluorine (Aleksandrov et al., 2019). In samples collected at Chinese landfill sites, \nhowever, Wang et al. (2020) were able to detect concentrations of ionic per- and polyfluorinated \ncompounds in the picogram (33) per cubic metre range. \n\nIn their study of emissions from landfill sites in Germany (Weinberg et al., 2019), a wide range of volatile \nand semi-volatile compounds were detected at the sites and also at lower concentrations at the reference \nsites. The enhancement above ambient concentrations was between 1.5 and 3 times. The greatest \nenrichment at the landfill sites was derived from the fluorotelomer alcohols. \n\n \n33 Picogram: 1 trillionth of a gram (10-12) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 60 \n\n Recent laboratory studies (Hamid et al., 2020) have shown the potential for fluorotelomer alcohols and \nsulfonates to produce PFOA and other carboxylic acids in landfill aqueous leachates albeit with a long halflife of greater than a year. It is possible that this slow process may be responsible for some future emissions \nfrom landfills, although the long half-life coupled with the low incidence of the precursors in landfill waste \nmake these emissions hard to detect in ambient air. \n\n6.5 Emissions of PFAS to air from the incineration of fluorinated polymers \n\nThe Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) requires that waste incineration plants must be designed \nto ensure the flue gases reach a temperature of at least 850 \u00b0C for 2 seconds to ensure the complete \nbreakdown of toxic organic substances. If hazardous waste with a content of more than 1% of halogenated \norganic substances (34) is incinerated or co-incinerated, the temperature should be at least 1 100 \u00b0C with \na minimum residence time of 2 seconds in order to mineralise all organic compounds. Lemieux et al., \n(2000), however, showed that peak temperatures in backyard open burning systems reached only 250\u2013\n620 \u00b0C. \n\nThis the following section on incineration therefore describes the thermal degradation at temperature \nranges of 250\u20131400 \u00b0C. \n\n6.5.1 Thermal degradation of fluorinated polymers, demonstrated theoretically or in \nlaboratories \n\nAs with pyrolysis, incineration or combustion is the decomposition of chemicals at high temperatures. The \ndifference lies in the presence of oxygen that is part of the reaction in incineration but not in pyrolysis. \nDepending on the temperature, incineration can result in very different end products. Ellis et al. (2001) \ndifferentiate incineration from thermolysis because of the presence of a fuel source in incineration that \nensures complete combustion of the material being incinerated. Thermolysis, with no fuel source, can run \nat lower temperatures, but enables the emission of different fluorocarbons in the process. It must be \nnoted, however, that the definition of the term thermolysis in Ellis et al. (2001) is not definitive; other \nsources define it as thermal decomposition without the presence of any oxygen, even less than in pyrolysis \n( 35 ,36 ) For the purpose of this report, incineration means thermal decomposition of chemicals in the \npresence of oxygen, irrespective of the temperature range. \n\nThe thermal decomposition of wastes is a multistage process and may additionally use a post-combustion \nfuel to raise the flue gas temperature above critical thresholds to ensure complete degradation of \nrecalcitrant compounds including halogenated materials. The flue gas is likely to be washed and filtered \nbefore release to the environment. The 2017 European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register lists 171 \nfacilities that annually discharged more than 5.0 tonnes the reporting threshold of inorganic fluorine \ncompounds as HF. The top 10 discharge facilities are a mixture of aluminium smelters, thermal power \nstations and ceramics producers. There are no waste and wastewater management facilities that report \nHF discharges. \n\nStudies on the behaviour of PTFE during thermal degradation showed that the process involved random \nchain cleavage, depolymerisation and disproportionation (Garcia et al., 2007). Slow decomposition occurs \nat 260 \u00b0C (Simon and Kaminsky, 1998) although there is a notable threshold at 400 \u00b0C above which the rate \nincreases significantly. Decomposition is essentially complete by 650 \u00b0C. At 800 \u00b0C, the half-life of PTFE is \n0.1 seconds and so 1 second at this temperature is equivalent to 10 half-lives. Yamada et al., (2005), for \nexample, showed that there were no detectable emissions of PFOA during the combustion of fabrics or \npaper treated with fluorotelomer-based acrylic polymers in municipal incinerators as the temperature \nwere likely to have been high enough to ensure complete conversion to HF.

(2001) summarised the combustion of PTFE after conducting experiments in an oven up to \n500 \u00b0C. They also identified difluorocarbene molecules as part of the major thermal degradation pathway \nleading to the formation of TFE. This may also lead to the formation of cyclo-octafluorobutane (c-OFB, cC4F8), a potent greenhouse gas with a GWP of 9 540, and, in the presence of oxygen, epoxides, ethers and \ncarboxylic acids including TFA. TFE, c-OFB, HFP, CF3(CF2)1-12COOH (PFCA), CF3O(CF2)1-7COOH, TFA, \nmonofluoroethane (MFA) and difluoroethane (DCM) were all experimentally identified by Ellis et al. (2001) \nin the thermal decomposition of PTFE at 500 \u00b0C and 360 \u00b0C. \n\nThe process, as proposed by Ellis et al. (2001), is shown, simplified, in Figure 6.3. In this scheme, TFA is one \nof the final products. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 62 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2. The proposed thermal degradation pathway summarises many of the pathways and products proposed \nby Garcia et al. (2007), Koch (2002) and Simon and Kaminsky (1998). The primary route is to the right indicated by \nthe thicker arrow. When percentages are given, the species was also quantified. PFAs were not identified in \nexperiments, while TFE, HFP and c-OFB were the major gases produced. \n\nSource: modified from Ellis et al. (2001) \n\nWith respect to the formation of ODS, during incineration of general household waste containing \nfluorinated polymers or the incineration of fluorinated polymers on their own, the ubiquitous presence of \nchlorine can cause their formation. \n\nAny fluorinated compound containing the C-CF3 group may degrade to TFA under certain circumstances \nand TFA can be a significant stable product in the mineralisation of certain fluorinated polymers such as \n1,1,1-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a, CF3CH2F), 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124, CF3CHFCl) \nand 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HCFC-123, CF3CHCl2) \u2013 note: all have the C-CF3 group. \n\nTFA is water soluble and readily washed out of the atmosphere by rain into the sea, rivers, lakes and \nground water. Due to its characteristics as a very strong acid, it is likely to exist in its ionic-free formiate \nform (CF3COO-). An additional source that causes natural enrichment in seawater was long suggested to \nbe TFA formation near hydrothermal systems with an estimated 6 000 kg annual input (Scott et al., 2005). \nIt must be noted, however, that most of the TFA in surface waters likely comes from anthropogenic \nsources. Further, Joudan et al., (2021) suggest that there is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that \nTFA occurs naturally at all and that there exists no reasonable mechanism of natural formation of TFA. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 63 \n\nBox 6.2 Sources of TFA \n\nOne major anthropogenic source of TFA is the degradation of HCFCs, HFCs, HFOs and HCFOs that are \nmainly used as refrigerants and foam-blowing agents. The most relevant substances in this context are \n1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 2,3,3,3-terafluoropropylene (HFO-1234yf). While other gases, \nsuch as HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 are practically entirely converted to TFA during atmospheric degradation \n(Kotamarthi et al., 1998), they are much less used and consequently emitted than many HFCs and HFOs. \nHFC-134a was until recently the major refrigerant in air-conditioning systems of passenger cars and light \ncommercial vehicles. Following MAC-Directive (2006/40/EC), the gas contained in such systems may not \nexceed a GWP of 150. This applies to the use in all new vehicles in the EU, starting from 2017. Since HFC134a has a global warming potential of 1 300, it has been replaced by the unsaturated low GWP gas HFO1234yf. While HFC-134a has a molar yield of TFA in the course of its atmospheric degradation of around \n7\u201320% (Wallington et al., 1996), HFO-1234yf degrades entirely to TFA (Hurley et al., 2008). Other HFCs and \nHFOs show a varying degree of TFA-yield, ranging from zero to 100%, depending on the intermediate \ndegradation products. While trifluoroacetyl fluoride (CF3CFO) is converted entirely to TFA, \ntrifluoroacetaldehyde (CF3CHO) is estimated to yield TFA of up to 10% on a molar basis (WMO, 2010). \n\nFor halogenated propylenes, the intermediate is determined by the atom that is bound to the central \ncarbon (WMO, 2014). If fluorine is bound to it, then CF3CFO and consequently TFA are the degradation \nproducts. This applies to HFO-1234yf. On the other hand, if hydrogen is bound to the central carbon, then \nCF3CHO is the intermediate product and the TFA yield will be much smaller. This applies to 1,1,1-3tetrafluoropropylene (HFO-1234ze) and 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (HCFC-1233zd), both gases that \nare marketed by industry as replacements of HFCs as refrigerants and foam-blowing agents. \n\nModelling studies of future deposition rates of TFA mostly focused on HFO-1234yf as it is a key precursor \ngas of TFA and limited their studies to its emissions from mobile air-conditioning systems in passenger \ncars. Across the United States, assuming all passenger cars in 2017 were equipped with HFO-1234yf \u2013 \nwhich is not the case since many older cars with HFC-134a are still in use but to gauge the effect once this \nconversion is completed \u2013 a fallout of 0.24 kg/km\u00b2 of TFA was modelled (Luecken et al., 2010). For Europe, \nHenne et al., (2012) also assumed a complete conversion from HFC-134a to HFO-1234yf in passenger cars \nin 2020 \u2013 which is also not the case but, again, intended to assess the future effect \u2013 and estimated an \naverage TFA deposition rate of 0.65\u20130.76 kg/km\u00b2 per year. Maxima of up to 2 kg/km\u00b2 per year were \nestimated for northern Italy. \n\nOther major sources for TFA include the metabolic and environmental degradation of pesticides and \npharmaceuticals carrying CF3-groups, more than 1 million chemicals, mostly found in sludge and rural \neffluents. The total contribution to existing amounts of TFA in the ocean as a result of the continued use \nof HCFCs, HFCs and HFOs up to 2050 is estimated to be a small fraction, <7.5% of the approximately 0.2 \n\u03bcg acid equivalents/L estimated to be present at the start of the millennium, indicating the presence of \nmajor additional sources (Solomon et al., 2016). The replacement of perfluorinated compounds with \npolyfluorinated ethers may, for example, induce enhanced UV degradability although with significant -CF3 \nproduction (Bentel et al., 2020). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3. Structure of TFA. \n\nSource: Own illustration \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 64 \n\ncont. \n\nFreeling et al. (2020) carried out a nationwide measuring programme of trifluoroacetate in precipitation \nin Germany. They concluded that in February 2018\u2013January 2019, the precipitation-weighted average \nconcentration of trifluoroacetate in wet deposition was 0.335 \u00b5g/l, which corresponds to an annual flux \nof 190 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 or around 68 tonnes (Freeling et al., 2020). Given the exceptionally dry conditions in 2018, \nthe wet deposition flux would amount to around 98 tonnes based on the average precipitation for 1981\u2013\n2010. This exceeds previously measured trifluoroacetate concentrations in Bayreuth, Germany in 1995\u2013\n1996 (Jordan and Frank, 1999) and Switzerland in 1996\u20131997 (Berg et al., 2000) by a factor of three to \nfive. Given the strong seasonality of the annual trifluoroacetate concentration and flux measured by \nFreelin g et al. (2020), precursors of TFA and trifluoroacetate are likely volatile compounds, such as HFCs \nand HFOs. \n\n \n\nSeveral studies on the ecotoxicity of TFA in water media, as well as some risk assessment studies of TFA \nhave been conducted. Box 6.2 summarises that TFA readily dissociates upon contact with water and builds \nhighly stable and unreactive salts (Solomon et al., 2016). Tests on different species found a generally low \ntoxicity of TFA salts, with the most sensitive species being the freshwater microalgae Raphidocelis \nsubcapitata (formerly Selenastrum capricornutum and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Adverse growth \neffects were detected at concentrations above 0.12 mg/L (Boutonnet et al., 1999). A new study performed \nby INERIS in 2017, however, found a no-effect concentration (NOEC) of 2.5 mg/L, which subsequently led \nto the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 0.56 mg/L TFA in freshwater according to ECHA (2020). \n\nDue to its complete water miscibility, TFA does not bioaccumulate or biomagnify up the food chain. \n\n6.5.2 Municipal incineration of fluorinated polymers and other perfluoroalkyl chemicals wastes \n\nMunicipal waste containing fluorinated polymers, such as end-of-life consumer products, is often \nincinerated in Europe (Table 6.4). Only limited amounts of fluorinated polymer waste can be incinerated \nin municipal waste incinerators due to the high corrosiveness of the hydrofluoric acid formed in \nincineration (Dams and Hintzer, 2017). There is, however, a lack of data concerning actual emissions of a \nvariety of volatile PFAS from municipal incinerators. Studies would be highly useful to get data, both when \nthe incinerators are operated at low-temperatures, such as during start-up or if energy consuming \nmaterials are added, and at optimal high-temperature conditions. \n\nAleksandrov et al. (2019) found that German municipal waste contained 0.01\u20130.035% fluorine. If, \nhowever, it is assumed that a fluorine content of 0.01% is a conservative estimate and that it is all PTFE, \nestimates of PFAS emissions are challenged by concerns on the usability of the data from this study (37). \nFurther, alternative, more volatile PFAS formation, as shown in Figure 6.2, is not taken into account. \n\nA review on PFAS emissions from waste incinerators has been published by RIVM (Bakker et al 2021). There \nis a lack of measurement data of PFAS in the recovered carbon dioxide and in cleaned flue gases. \nMeasurements of PFAS in these streams are recommended in the review for better understanding of the \nrisks of transmission of PFAS from incinerators.  \n\nThe household waste produced by European countries is shown in Table 6.5, with the countries ranked by \nthe volume of waste produced per person. The Scandinavian countries, with the exception of Iceland, \nshow the highest incineration/energy recovery rates at 48\u201353%. \n\n \n\n \n37 In the study by Aleksandrov et al., (2019) the level of PFOA in the blanks exceeded the levels of PFOA in the samples, which \n\nwere apparently not corrected for the background levels. This questions the reliability of the conclusions of the Aleksandrov et \nal. (2019) study. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 65 \n\nTable 6.5.

This may include devices and tubing along with \ncontainers for drugs and solutions. All medical waste is considered hazardous and in Europe is disposed of \nthrough licensed high temperature incinerators in which the temperature should ensure the complete \nmineralisation of the polymers to HF. \n\nThe overall picture on the incineration of waste containing fluorinated polymers is as follows. \n- There is a high risk that fluorinated polymers degrade to both highly volatile and ionic/water \n\nsoluble PFAS if the combustion temperature is not high enough to ensure the complete \nmineralisation of fluoropolymers to HF. Also, if degradation is incomplete, highly persistent TFA \nand HCFs with high GWPs may be formed. \n\n- The levels of volatiles formed in incineration depends on combustion/flue gas temperature, \noxygen and residence time. \n\n- It is likely that some fluorinated polymer containing wastes are sent to municipal waste \nincineration plants. However, there is lack of reliable information on amounts PFAS actually \nemitted in flue gases from municipal waste incineration plants. \n\n- No information is available on incineration conditions of waste treated outside EU \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 66 \n\n6.5.3 Kiln incineration of fluorinated polymers and other PFAS wastes \n\nThe Yamada and Taylor (2003) study was one of the first to assess the temperatures required for PFOS \ndestruction at more than 900 \u00baC. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) POPs guide on PFOS \nis a reference for destruction at 1100 \u00baC based on the work on PFOS in isolation cited by the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (US EPA). \n\nWang et al. (2015a) demonstrated that PFOS destruction catalysed by calcium could be at much lower \ntemperatures, possibly due to the calcium stripping of the fluorine shifting the reaction equilibrium. \n\nCement kilns are fairly criticised globally for their fossil fuel use, emissions of CO2 and nitrogen oxides \n(NOx), and the possible formation of chlorinated and brominated compounds (Karstensen, 2012). While \nfluorine is also a halogen, it behaves entirely differently simply due to the stripping effect of the high \nproportions of calcium and the permanent capture as calcium fluorine (Ca-F). (Patterson and Dastgheib, \n2020, Wang et al 2015a) \n\nOverall, cement kilns are seeking to improve their energy use and emissions, will be in operation for at \nleast some decades longer than society will need to dispose of PFAS waste, and represent the best \navailable technology for its destruction given: \n\n- very large safety margins of temperature and residence times in the normal cement clinker \nproduction process; \n\n- catalyses PFAS destruction at lower temperatures in all parts of the process; \n- fluorine stripping and permanent capture as inert CaF2. \n- no additional energy expenditure above normal operating conditions and possible energy savings; \n- no special modification of the kiln operation needed as fuel is introduced mixed into waste oil; \n- no effect on the quality of cement \u2013 fluorine has long been used to improve cement hardness. \n\nThere are some organisations that are philosophically strongly opposed to cement kilns but on a netbenefit analysis they cannot justify the alternative that has a much higher risk of PFAS emissions, large \nenergy expenditure of hazmat incineration and the cost of neutralising and disposing of the fluoride waste \nproduced. \n\nIn conclusion there may be new techniques that can increase the removal of PFAS from incineration \nexhaust, which would be beneficial to investigate further also in Europe. \n\n6.5.4 Uncontrolled burning of wastes \n\nSome electronic and electrical components such as wire is insulated with PTFE and PVDF. In less developed \ncountries4, the recovery of the copper from this wire, using low-technology methods such as burning, may \nrelease PFAS into the atmosphere (Figure 6.4). \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 67 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4. Low temperature combustion of polymers associated with wire and printed circuit boards along with other \ne-waste at Agbogbloshie, Ghana, 2018. \n\nPhoto: S.Mudge \n\nStudies conducted on backyard burning systems by Lemieux et al. (2000) only observed temperatures in \nexcess of 500 \u00b0C on one occasion, suggesting that temperatures will usually be lower. Additionally, there \nis no information on the emission rates of any fluorinated compounds in their study. Oxygen may be a \nlimiting factor in such systems as well and there may be a wider range of compounds formed than \nindicated in a study by Aleksandrov et al. (2019). In the absence of further information, this probably \nrepresents a conservative estimate of the PFOA and of other volatile PFAS emissions in low temperature \ncombustion conditions, as shown in Figure 6.2. \n\n6.6 Knowledge gaps \n\nFollowing knowledge gaps have been identified: \n\n\u2022 lack of information on actual handling and management of fluorinated polymer-containing \nproducts used in many applications, such as in vehicles and electronics, in the production of \nchemicals and use in renewable energy applications; \n\n\u2022 detection limits used in the literature for analysis of emissions; \n\n\u2022 number of substances included varies in studies; \n\n\u2022 standardisation of monitoring of emissions \u2013 sampling and analytics; \n\n\u2022 no data available on the current recycling rates of products; \n\n\u2022 lack of information on release mechanisms of PFAS from landfills, degradation/transformation in \nlandfill conditions and the fate of leachates; \n\n\u2022 lack of information on cost efficient wastewater treatment systems for landfill leachate; \n\n\u2022 assessment of past and present sludge/waste management and the disposal practices of users of \nfluorinated polymers, such as paper factories, carpet factories or factories producing Tefloncoated kitchenware, bearing the large-scale contamination in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany in \nmind (Goldenman et al., 2019); \n\n\u2022 situation of landfills where the organofluorine and fluorinated polymer industries have disposed \nof their waste over the last 50 years; \n\n\u2022 situation of landfills where users of fluorinated polymers, such as paper factories, carpet factories \nor factories producing Teflon-coated kitchenware, have disposed of their production wastes; \n\n\u2022 potential export beyond Europe of end-of-life products containing critical raw materials outside \nfor metal recovery. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 68 \n\n7 Overall impacts along the lifecycles \n\nMain authors: Margareta Wahlstr\u00f6m and Xenia Trier \nContributors: Dorte Herzke, Barbara Gschrey and Peder Gabrielsen \n\nKey messages: \n\n\u2022 Potential impacts along the lifecycle of fluorinated polymers that support or conflict with the goals \nof EU strategies were identified. \n\n\u2022 Circular economy: \n\u25aa support: durable, longevity, miniaturisation of products generating less waste; \n\u25aa conflict: fluorspar on list of critical raw materials, no information on recycling, \n\nminimal recycling identified. \n\n\u2022 Low carbon economy: \n\u25aa support: use in renewable energy applications, reduced energy need \u2013 lighter \n\nvehicles, etc.; \n\u25aa conflict: feedstocks with the potential to emit GHG used in production. \n\n\u2022 Zero Pollution Ambition/toxic-free environment \n\u25aa support: longevity; \n\u25aa conflict: use of toxic feedstocks potentially emitted in production, use and end of \n\nlife. \n\n\u2022 Other considerations may include benefits to human health such as high performing medical \nutensils and diagnostic instruments, protective clothing for occupational use, or use of \nprotective textiles to minimise risks for medical staff and patients from exposure of infectious \nagents in medical treatment. \n\n7.1  Approach \n\nIn this chapter impacts are analysed in the light of EU policies, which were introduced with the European \nGreen Deal in 2019 by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. As a consequence of the \nEuropean Green Deal, a number of strategies and action plans to reduce human and environmental health \ndegradation have been launched, including on the CE, resource efficiency and raw materials, the lowcarbon economy and the Zero Pollution Ambition for a toxic free environment. \n\n\u2022 The CE aims to foster an economy that retains as much of the value of materials as possible, for as \nlong as possible (EEA, 2016). To achieve a transition to a CE, action needs to address all products\u2019 \nlifecycle stages, and therefore needs to go beyond waste management and improved recycling. \nAlso the growing waste generation from renewable energy sets need to implement CE principles \nby applying circular business models to maintain producer responsibility and facilitating reuse and \nmaterial recovery from renewable energy applications after use .(EEA, 2021) \n\n\u2022 The low-carbon economy aims to minimise emissions of GHG to the atmosphere. Focus areas \ninclude shifting from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, \nand promotion of energy efficient products and processes. \n\n\u2022 The Zero Pollution Ambition for a toxic-free environment, and the Chemicals Strategy for \nSustainability towards a toxic-free environment (CSS) (EC, 2020), both aim to avoid harm from \npollution to people and the environment. The CSS emphasises the need to prevent further \npollution by substances of concern, particularly for those that accumulate or cause effects that \naccumulate in people or the environment. Persistent chemicals such as PFAS (EC, 2020b), bioactive \nchemicals, such as endocrine disrupters, and mixtures of chemicals (EC, 2020c) are highlighted \nexamples. \n\nThe New Circular Economy Action Plan was launched in 2020 and focusses on sustainable resource use, \nespecially in resource-intensive and high impact sectors such as electronics and information and \ncommunications technology (ICT); batteries and vehicles; packaging; plastics; textiles; construction and \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 69 \n\nbuildings; food; water and nutrients. Fluorinated polymers are, with the exception of the food, packaging, \nwater and nutrients sectors, relevant to these sectors. Examples of measures mentioned are as follows: \n\n\u2022 make sustainable products, with a focus on the safety of consumers and the environment; \n\n\u2022 ensure less waste; \n\n\u2022 make circularity work for people, regions and cities; \n\n\u2022 assess potential impacts of recycling practises; \n\n\u2022 lead global efforts on the circular economy. \n\nThe New Circular Economy Action plan contains a legislative initiative proposal to widen the Eco-Design \nDirective to the broadest possible range of products rather than just energy-related ones. The new Action \nPlan announces initiatives along the entire lifecycle of products, targeting, for example, their safe and \nsustainable design, promoting CE processes, fostering sustainable consumption, and aiming to ensure that \nresources used are kept within the EU economy for as long as possible. It introduces legislative and nonlegislative measures targeting areas in which action at the EU level brings real added value. \n\nIn relation to the EU raw materials initiative, the European Commission has created a list of critical raw \nmaterials that are important to the European economy but are also associated with supply risks (European \nCommission, 2020). One of the listed materials is fluorspar, which is used as input in the production of \nfluorinated polymers. Increased recycling would be one way of reducing dependence on imports, as well \nas improving material efficiency and reducing the lifecycle environmental impacts of applications. \nCurrently, fluorspar is recycled but only to a small extent since it is transformed to other chemicals when \nused, and recycling is currently complex (British Geological Survey, 2010). \n\nThis chapter builds on findings presented in previous chapters. The outcome of the analysis is presented \nfor different stages of the fluorinated polymer lifecycle. Benefits and challenges related to the circular \neconomy and resource efficiency, climate effects and toxic-free environment are assessed qualitatively. \n\n7.2 Focus on the circular economy, resource efficiency and the EU raw material strategy \n\nFluorinated polymers can provide useful properties to products used in various sectors. According to \ninformation presented in literature (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, 2018; WOOD, 2020), fluorinated polymers can, for \ninstance, contribute to material or energy savings, while some of their uses can be considered essential \nfor society with regard to protecting human or environmental health. In this context, a use that is essential \nto society providing, for example, important health functions, is one for which the fluorinated polymer \ncannot be substituted by other materials, products or services delivering comparable performance at the \ntime of assessment. Conversely, a non-essential use, whether beneficial or not, is one that can be replaced \nwith a non-fluorinated product or service with a comparable performance. With time, innovation of \nalternatives may render previously essential uses, non-essential. Some examples of fluorinated polymer \nmaterials which have a range of non-essential to essential uses are provided in Cousins et al. (2019) while \na wider list of fluorinated polymers uses is provided in Gl\u00fcge et al. (2020). Some examples of useful \nfluorinated polymers \u2013 but not necessarily essential ones \u2013 are presented below. \n\n- Electronics: dielectric properties of fluorinated polymers have enabled the miniaturization of \ncomponents and final products, and hence to savings in raw materials. Fluorinated polymers can \nalso provide fire safety; high transmission speeds; and ease of installation and reliability of wires, \nas well as optical and data transmission cables. As an example, a report published by the United \nStates fluoropolymer industry (WOOD, 2020) states that the use of fluorinated polymers in \nelectronic applications may prolong their lifetimes by up to three times. The calculations and \nboundary conditions for this statement have not, however, been evaluated in this report. \n\n- Transport: prolonging component/product lifetimes in the automotive and aerospace industries \ndue to fluorinated polymers having high resistance against heat, cold, fire, smoke, aggressive \nfluids, fuels, humidity, vibrations and compressions. Improved functionality due to high reliability, \nengine efficiency, weight reduction and emission control, and fuel efficiency. The report published \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 70 \n\nby the United States fluoropolymer industry (WOOD, 2020) presents the following examples of \nbenefits in two applications: in cars, the use of fluorinated polymers contributed to a 48% increase \nin fuel efficiency, calculated on the average fuel use per kilometre travelled in American cars in \n1980\u20132016 (WOOD, 2020). In aerospace, a 93% corrosion reduction in cargo bays and avoided \nfriction damage in helicopters has been demonstrated for the use of a specific product (WOOD, \n2020). Again, the calculations and the boundary conditions used for these benefits have not been \nevaluated in this report. \n\n- Medical utensils: prolonging lifetimes of surgical implantable devices, the reduction in \ncomplications and failures due to clogging of medical pumps and catheters. Fluorinated polymer \ntextiles protect medical staff and patients from exposure to infectious agents. Use of fluorinated \npolymers provides improved reliability in the use of such medical appliances as X-rays, and \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) equipment (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, \n2018; WOOD, 2020). \n\n- Chemical industry: reduction of corrosion and leaks, lower maintenance, safety (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, \n2018; WOOD, 2020). \n\n- Building sector: durable materials that prolong lifetimes, increase fire safety and reduce \nmaintenance needs (Am\u00e9duri, 2020, 2018; WOOD, 2020). \n\nIn Table 7.1 measures or actions for achieving CE solutions listed in the new Circular Economy Action Plan \nare analysed for different lifecycle stages based on the information gathered in Chapters 3\u20136. Circular \neconomy solutions identified in the use phase were mainly related to material and energy savings due to \nhigh functionality, safety and miniaturisation, the last of which also leads to the generation of less waste. \nFluorspar is, however, a critical raw material and the recycling rate is low due to the dispersed use of \nfluorinated polymers in applications. For many CE measures or actions no information was available. The \ncurrent practice of recycling of PTFE into microplastic (micro powder) needs detailed assessment in \nparticular since most uses are dispersive, releasing the PTFE microplastic into the indoor or wider \nenvironment. \n\nThe expected impact was categorised on the basis of expert judgement (Table 7.1). The reasoning for the \ncategorisation is explained within the table. Where there is uncertainty associated with the lack of \ninformation about supporting circular economy solutions, this is mentioned. \n\nTable 7.1.

As an \nexample, the worldwide market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow from 78 gigawatt hours \n(GWh) in 2016 to 210 GWh at a compound annual growth rate of plus 13% between 2016 and 2025, with \nthe highest growth expected in electric vehicles and industrial applications (Pillot, 2017). As the demand \nfor electric vehicles has grown rapidly in recent years and the lifespan of their batteries is roughly 10 years, \ngrowing lithium-ion battery waste streams are expected in the near future. \n\nChallenges related to the expected growth of these markets are related to several aspects along the \nlifecycle: \n\n\u2022 raw material production; \n\n\u2022 GHG emissions during the production process; \n\n\u2022 GHG emissions at the end of a product\u2019s life. \n\nIn the production phase, there are risks of emissions of GHG and ODS (Chapter 4.1). In the literature, there \nis no information on measured or calculated emissions related to different fluorinated polymer production \nprocesses. Accurate and transparent reporting of emissions from production processes is widely lacking \nand thus does not allow for the monitoring and verification of reduction targets. \n\nReporting of GHG emissions at the end of life is often neither accurate nor transparent. Furthermore, \nexports of end-of-life products for further (re-)use and/or extraction of materials to areas without \nstringent environmental policies and standards put efforts for reductions of the carbon footprint at risk. \n\n7.4 Focus on safety \n\nSafety is a term used to describe either the potential risks or the observed impacts of a stressor on human \nor environmental health. In this context the stressor may be one or multiple chemicals. In addition, there \nmay be other kinds of hazard, such as physical, microbiological and elements of biosafety, but these are \nnot described here. In general terms the size of the risk/impact is determined by the hazard, how \ndangerous it is; and the exposure, the likelihood of being exposed to the danger: Risk = Hazard x Exposure. \n\nThere are different types of risks/impacts, since chemicals have different kinds of toxicity or hazards. \nExamples of hazards are carcinogenicity; mutagenicity; reproductive and developmental toxicity; \nsensitising and neurodevelopmental effects; metabolic; cardiovascular; and endocrine disruption. \nTypically, toxicological testing will determine which types of hazards chemicals have, and at which \nconcentration level the effects will start to occur. Different species, for example, humans and animals, or \nbetween biota in an ecosystem, may experience different effects; effectively the chemicals may have \ndifferent hazards for different species. The level at which the effects start to show can also differ between \nspecies and at different life stages \u2013 a developing child, for example, tends to be more vulnerable to \nchemical stressors than fully developed adults. People and ecosystems that are exposed to additional \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 72 \n\nstressors, including heat stress, may also be less resilient in coping with the chemical stress and therefore \nlower levels may create impacts. \n\nExposure says something about how much of a chemical a person or living organism is exposed to. \nExposure is a combination of the concentration levels and how frequent the exposure to the chemical(s) \nis(are). Chemicals that are persistent will accumulate either internally in the organism (bioaccumulative) \nor externally in the environment (persistent and mobile chemicals). Either will lead to increasing exposure, \nand thereby risk. Persistency is a combination of intrinsic properties of the molecule and the capacity of \nthe system it is dispersed in to degrade it. This capacity may change depending on physical conditions such \nas temperature/climate, light, access to oxygen, surfaces that bind the chemicals, mixing of a system due, \nfor example, to wind, and on biological conditions, such as microbes and other biota which may help to \ndegrade the chemicals. \n\nPFAS appearing as impurities or additives in, or as degradation products of fluorinated polymer products \nare examples of substances that have lately created high concern. This is due to a number of \nconsiderations and the characteristics of PFAS (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020): PFAS consist of more than 5 000 \nchemicals which are or form persistent degradation products; which accumulate in people and/or the \nenvironment; some PFAS are persistent and mobile in air and water; others stick to surfaces such as soil \nand bioaccumulate in people and biota. Furthermore, the large majority of tested PFAS are somewhat \ntoxic either to humans, biota or Earth systems and are difficult to remove from contaminated materials, \nsoil and water. \n\nIdentifying hazardous materials in waste streams is of great importance so that they can be removed prior \nto recycling. The Zero Pollution Ambition for a toxic-free environment calls for the risks posed by very \npersistent chemicals to be addressed rapidly. Potential hazards and their expected impacts are mainly \nanalysed qualitatively because data are lacking on both hazards and exposure to the majority of PFAS, and \nparticularly the risks to ecosystem health. \n\nIn the production of fluorinated polymers, feedstock chemicals containing PFAS and other substances of \nconcern are used, including carcinogens. Toxic degradation products and by-products are also formed \nduring the manufacturing process. Several chemicals with both high GWP and ODP are also used, but there \nis hardly any monitoring of these substances or reporting of emission data in the literature. \n\nEmissions to water, soil, air and the wider environment of a large number of poly- and perfluorinated \nhighly volatile and water-soluble by-products have been reported at sites close to fluorinated polymer \nproduction plants. The fluorinated processing aids used also create concerns. Banned toxic chemicals, such \nas PFOA, have been replaced to ensure decreased persistency and bioaccumulation. However, the \nmodified molecular design, with higher volatility and higher KAW values, lead to higher emissions to the \natmosphere. \n\nDuring fluorinated polymer production, PFAS emissions of PFOA and PFNA substitutes to air, water and \nsoil are estimated to be about 120 t/year for Europe. The environmental degradation of fluorinated \nproduction aids, emitted during fluorinated polymer production, can lead to the formation of PFCAs and \nPFSAs, unstable intermediates, all forming a complex mixture of potentially harmful chemicals emitted to \nthe environment. Biological uptake has been shown in both flora and fauna, further endangering wildlife \nand human health through food production. Drinking water can be polluted when some of the very watersoluble alternatives to PFOA enter the soil and water systems. \n\nMoreover, occupational health and safety is important to consider due to the potentially toxic feedstocks \nand end-products, and degradation products and by-products formed during the polymer production, \nmanufacturing and use. Inhalation of pyrolysis products of PTFE has been reported to lead to serious toxic \nimpacts such as pulmonary edema and pneumonitis, and flu-like symptoms, sometimes called polymer \nfume fever (Johnson, 2018a). In animal studies, several other effects are seen such as tumors and higher \nmortality. In addition, studies have reported cases of pulmonary injury, for example in workers in the \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 73 \n\nbuilding industry exposed to waterproofing spray products containing fluorinated polymers (Scheepers et \nal., 2017; Lazor-Blanchet et al., 2004). In some cases, polymers contain a large proportion of oligomers, for \nexample, polychlorotrifluoroethylene may consist mainly of trimers (55%) and tetramers (45%) of \nchlorotrifluoroethylene (Johnson, 2018a). These are very small molecules consisting of only three and four \nrepeat-units, and thus oligomers which just qualify as polymers according to the ECHA definition (Section \n2.1). According to several animal studies, summarised by Johnson (2018a) these oligomers are taken up \non inhalation, bioaccumulate and form toxic degradation products. \n\nIn the use phase, the impacts are application specific. At the end-of-life stage there is a lack of information \nabout impacts due to the dispersive use of fluorinated polymers in a variety of applications in transport \nand energy production as well as in, for example, coatings and insulation materials in buildings. \n\nThere is a dispersed use of products containing fluorinated polymers in numerous applications but the \nexposure of consumers during use is highly application specific. Examples of exposure routes from some \napplications include: \n\n\u2022 inhalation of volatiles/aerosols emitted from products: overheating of kitchen utensils, spaying of \nimpregnating agents containing fluorinated polymers, and indoor dust; \n\n\u2022 direct human exposure from PFAS in food-contact materials leaching into food; \n\n\u2022 dermal contact through textiles and cosmetics/personal care products but this exposure route is \nconsidered minor compared to dietary exposure and inhalation of indoor dust; \n\n\u2022 emissions to the environment: intentional use of fluorinated microplastics, such as teflon used to \nlower friction in, for example, bicycles, other metal lubricants, and personal care products such as \nshaving foams (DK EPA, 2018), may contribute to emissions of non-degradable, persistent \nmicroplastics to the environment. Degradation of fluorinated polymers during use includes, for \nexample, the release of fibres containing them from textiles during washing, and these end up in \nwastewater. \n\nFurthermore, the risk of the dispersive use of micro-PTFE (micropowder), which amounted to about 10 000 \ntonnes of irradiated micropowder in 2010, also need to be assessed considering that PTFE does not \ndegrade in the environment for centuries and might accumulate. \n\nSome 8 300 tonnes of waste per year arise from consumer products containing fluorinated polymers, of \nwhich an estimated 1 280 tonnes is PTFE used in cooking and baking utensils (Chapter 4). Waste from \nconsumer products is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. \n\nWhen waste containing fluorinated polymers is incinerated there is a risk that under certain conditions \u2013 \nlow temperatures, low oxygen supply and short residence times in the burner \u2013 the polymers may degrade \nto TFA. This is a breakdown product of several HCFCs, regulated under the Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, as well as several saturated and unsaturated HFCs, which are \nregulated under the EU F-gas Regulation 517/2014 and, in the case of saturated HFCs, addressed by the \nKigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol at an international level. Trifluoroacetic acid is water soluble \nand is readily washed out of the atmosphere by rain and enters the sea, rivers, lakes and groundwater, but \ngenerally it has low toxicity for aquatic organisms. No estimates of the emissions of TFA, particularly from \nthe incineration of waste containing fluorinated polymers, has been reported in the literature as there are \nother sources of TFA emissions. No dedicated measurements of TFA and other small organofluorine \nmolecules have been reported from incineration experiments, which largely focus on PFOS and PFOA \nmonitoring. Considering that in pilot studies of co-incineration of PTFE, the fluorine mass balance from HF \nwas only 56% at 870 \u02daC and a 4 second residence time, and 78% at 1 020 \u02daC and a 2.7 second residence \ntime (Aleksandrov et al., 2019), other potential organofluorine releases like TFA and CF4 should be \nassessed in addition to the potential formation of other inorganic fluorides. \n\nFurthermore, chemical recycling, for example pyrolysis, of plastic is increasingly promoted and due to their \ndispersive uses, fluorinated polymers will likely end-up in chemical recycling processes. As a result, the \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 74 \n\nmaterial flow of fluorinated polymers entering plastic pyrolysis and chemical recycling and associated \nreleases of fluorinated GHG and ODS should be analysed. \n\nPFOA and other PFAS can be emitted from municipal waste incineration. No reliable European data have \nbeen found but incineration of waste has increased in Europe since the ban of the disposal of \nbiodegradable waste at landfills (EUROSTAT, 2020). Nonetheless, it can be assumed that PFOA and a broad \nrange of other PFAS are formed, with large differences in emission volumes between the European \ncountries, due to the burning of domestic waste with different emission factors. Additionally, the amount \nof fluorinated polymers present in burned waste may vary due to differences in the composition of waste \ncollected across European countries. \n\nThe landfilling rate of municipal waste in Europe has decreased from 44% in 2006 to 23% in 2017. Annual \nemissions of PFAS from consumer products disposed of in landfill are estimated to be 0.43\u20133.7 tonnes in \nEurope (calculated based on population in 37 European countries). However, for a reliable assessment of \nreleases from landfills more data from standardised monitoring programmes are needed. The emissions \nto air, soil and water from landfills depends on measures taken at the landfills to prevent rainwater \nentering the waste and minimising water transport and gas emission from the landfill body. In old landfills, \nseals are often missing, and leakage may occur. Waste from applications containing fluorinated polymers \nfrom the transport, chemicals and energy production sectors may, at end of life, end up in smelters if used \nas coatings or integrated parts in metals, or in shredder waste if used in wires or cables from, for example, \nvehicles. \n\nWastewater treatment plants are an important point source of PFAS to the surrounding environment; \nstudies show that treated wastewater contain some level of PFAS. There is, however, a lack of information \non fluorinated polymers influx to wastewater plants, and efflux of PFAS from fluorinated polymers in \nsludge, water and to air from wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, microplastics from the intentional \nuse of fluoropolymers in, for example, consumer products such as personal care products and bicycle \nlubricants, and from degradation and abrasion of fluorinated polymer materials and surfaces may end up \nin wastewater plants from where these pollutants can further end up in water, soil and air. The regulation \nof fluorinated polymers and intentional uses of microplastics are further described in Section 8.2. \n\n7.5 Examples of impact reductions from the replacement of fluorinated polymers \n\nIn many applications, the properties of fluorinated polymers make their replacement challenging in terms \nof equal performance of materials. Only a few studies have been found in literature of the reduction of \nenvironmental impacts as a result of replacing fluorinated polymers. Articles, such as on alternative \nmaterials for fluorinated polymers in fuel cells for the production of renewable energy, focus on their \nreplacement for cost reduction purposes. \n\nBox 7.1 provides an example of replacing materials containing fluorinated polymers in photovoltaic panels, \nthereby reducing their environmental impacts once they become waste. The fluorinated polymeric \nbacksheets are used to protect the panels from moisture and adverse weathering and lengthen their \noperational lives (Figure 7.1). In Section 8.4.1.5, the use of PTFE in photovoltaic panels in a circular and \nnon-toxic economy is discussed further. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 75 \n\nBox 7.1 Comparison of end-of-life treatment of photovoltaic panels containing fluorinated and nonfluorinated polymers \n\nThe production of solar energy using photovoltaic panels, which have a lifespan of 25\u201330 years is expected \nto increase significantly in coming years. In 2016, global photovoltaic waste for the year was estimated to \nbe 45 000 tonnes and it is likely that this will increase to 1.7 million tonnes by 2030 and 60 million tonnes \nby 2050 (Aryan et al., 2018). Fluorinated polymers are used as a protective layer in the backsheet of \nphotovoltaic panels, making up roughly 3% of the backsheet material\u2019s weight or approximately 0.2% of \nweight of the whole panel. \n\nA lifecycle analysis (Aryan et al., 2018) compared the environmental impacts of two potential end-of-life \nmanagement scenarios \u2013 incineration and pyrolysis \u2013 of fluorinated and non-fluorinated backsheets. In \nthe incineration scenario, the non-fluorinated backsheets showed environmental benefits in 11 of 12 \nimpact categories evaluated  \u2013 the exception being for GWP. The corresponding pyrolysis scenario showed \nbetter environmental performance for the non-fluorinated backsheets in 8 of 12 categoires. However, the \npyrolysis scenario revealed a high release of HF and the presence of significant amounts of fluorine both \nin the form of toxic halogenated hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis products. This \nsuggests that pyrolysis for the non-fluorinated backsheets is not as environmentally feasible as it is for of \nbackshees containing fluorinated polymers. Additionally, pyrolysis is generally less attractive from an \neconomic viewpoint. \n\nThe lifecycle study concludes that non-fluorinated backsheets containing bio- or polyethylene \nterephthalate-based alternative materials are to be recommended. For fluorinated backsheets, the \npreferred management option is incineration together with other waste materials in order to comply with \nenvironmental emission requirements. In addition, it is proposed that the producers should provide \ninformation on the materials in the backsheet, using, for example, ecolabels, to ensure the waste receives \nappropriate end-of-life treatment. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1.

Using PTFE \ncould hamper circular potential and is not line with the ambitions of the Commission in the \nChemicals Strategy for Sustainability. \n\n\u2022 Within the overall process of risk governance, there are different options to implement criteria for \nessential use. \n\n\u2022 There is a need to unambiguously define criteria or considerations for essential use to enable \napplication of the concept in decision making processes. \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\nThis chapter examines to what extent the main elements in current risk governance of fluorinated \npolymers are in line with a CE, a low carbon economy and a toxic-free environment strategy, with a specific \nfocus on the circular economy, using a systematic approach based on the International Risk Governance \nCouncil (IRGC) risk governance framework. More specifically, it is discussed the question whether changes \nare needed in the governance of substances of (potential) concern, and specifically for fluorinated \npolymers. Risk governance marks out institutional structures and sociopolitical processes that guide and \nrestrain collective activities of a group, society, or international community to influence or direct the \ncourse of events or people\u2019s behaviour when dealing with risk issues (IRGC, 2017; Renn and Klinke, 2016; \nKlinke and Renn, 2012), Further, the concept of essential use has been introduced in the CSS. In this \nchapter, no difference is made between the various types of fluorinated polymers, and for illustrative \npurposes some examples are added. \n\nThe risk governance of fluorinated polymers in a circular economy should be seen as part of the broader \ndiscussion on the European Green Deal. As mentioned in Chapter 1, a set of policy objectives have been \nformulated in the European Green Deal by the European Commission with the overarching goal of making \nEurope climate neutral by 2050 (Commission, 2019). It provides an action plan to: \n\n1. boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean CE and; \n2. restore biodiversity and prevent pollution from being generated. \n\nIn a CE the amount of harmful substances will preferably be lower and no harmful substances will be \nreleased from the technosphere (production, consumption and end-of-life). Both a chemical of interest \nand the related product come with their own lifecycles. Chemical lifecycles span the entire supply chain \nfor harvesting resources, synthesising, and processing a chemical, and related waste handling. Product \nlifecycles do not only cover the considered and other chemicals included in the same product with their \nrespective supply chains, but also include resources used and emissions related to energy converted \nduring, for example, product manufacturing, use, and end-of-life handling including recycling (Fantke et \nal., 2020). \n\nIn Section 8.2 an overview of challenges in the regulation of fluorinated polymers is given, and in Section \n8.3 a short introduction to the IRGC framework is presented. This is continued with a discussion of whether \nfluorinated polymers fit in a CE (Section 8.4) and in what way the concept of essential use may support \nrisk governance of fluorinated polymers and the consequences of specific implementations of the concept \n(Section 8.5). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 77 \n\n8.2 Challenges in the regulation of fluorinated polymers \n\nPFAS have become a matter of regulatory and public concern due to their persistency, bioaccumulation, \nand possible ecological and human health effects. To date, there is both vertical and horizontal legislation \nthat apply to PFAS. Vertical regulations are those that address part of a lifecycle, including work-place \nexposure, emissions during production, risks during use, or the waste-management and end-of-life phases. \nThe vertical regulations should comply with the REACH requirements which is a horizontal legislation. \n\nA (non-exhaustive) summary of different international and European regulations on PFAS is presented in \nthe Annex 3. \n\nFluorinated polymers are known to be extremely persistent and there is evidence that they do not degrade \nunder environmental conditions (Ameduri, 2020). In addition, the use of the different fluorinated polymers \nmight cause several environmental and human health risks throughout their lifecycle(s). First, the \nproduction of some fluorinated polymers, such as fine powder PTFE and PVDF, is intimately linked to the \nuse of legacy and novel PFAS, for example, ether-based PFAS as emulsifiers during emulsion \npolymerization process. Most of PFAS-based processing aids are considered environmental toxicants of \npotential concern, of which some have been classified as SVHCs (Gebreab et al., 2020, Rice et al., 2021). \nSecond, a variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomer impurities (unintentional non-polymer \nPFAS by-products) are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of \nfluorinated polymers. In general, polymer products contain residual monomers, oligomers, impurities, \ntransformation products and often their properties drive the overall hazard of the polymer products \n(Chapter 4). In addition, intentionally used fluorinated polymer microplastics (PTFE microparticles) \n(Sections 5.5 and 5.6) may generate nanoplastics as (bio)degradation products of these microplastics that \nmay have higher bioaccumulation potential inducing potentially adverse health effects. There are further \nconcerns regarding the safe disposal of fluorinated polymers and their associated products and articles at \nthe end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluorinated polymers is performed on some \nindustrial waste repositories, only limited options exist for their recycling from consumer articles (Sections \n6.1 and 6.2) (Lohmann et al., 2020). Regulating fluorinated polymers is a complex task because it needs to \naddress all phases in the lifecycle of these chemicals. \n\nRecently, under the REACH regulation the national authorities of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, \nNorway and Sweden have started preparing a joint REACH restriction proposal on PFAS as a group to limit \nthe risks to the environment and human health from their manufacture and use. These authorities prefer \na broad restriction covering all different PFAS substances and uses, instead of separate legislation on \nspecific PFAS or specific uses. The broad restriction would limit as many (non-essential) uses as practically \npossible. This would have the greatest impact on preventing and thereby minimising human and \nenvironmental exposure to PFAS. It would also include currently unknown PFAS and uses as well as \nfluorinated polymers and would prevent regrettable substitution of restricted PFAS by other PFAS (RMOA, \n2021 (38)). \n\nMore specifically on fluoropolymers, while polymers are exempted from registration and evaluation in the \nEU under Article 2(9) of the REACH Regulation (EP and Council, 2006) they are not exempted from \nrestriction or authorisation, and the monomers from which a polymer is formed must be registered \n(REACH Article 6(3)). Overall, the REACH Regulation does not exclude the future possibility of a \nrequirement to register polymers. The Regulation has laid down that the European Commission may \npresent criteria to characterise \u2018polymers of concern (PLC)\u2019, justify the selected criteria and may also \npresent criteria for polymers of high concern (PHC); to propose solutions for their grouping as well as \nregistration requirements (PRR) under REACH; and to estimate the potential risks posed by such PLCs in \ncomparison to other chemicals based on available scientific evidence on their hazards and exposure \n\n \n38 Assessment of regulatory needs list - ECHA (europa.eu) \n\nhttps://echa.europa.eu/en/rmoa/-/dislist/details/0b0236e184db2d36\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 78 \n\n(European Commission, 2018). In addition, the derogation from labelling of polymers implemented in the \nCLP based on a lack of bioavailability as an essential determinant for the lack of hazard concerns. \n\nPolymers are also regulated (directly as the final product and indirectly via the monomers, additives and \nprocessing aids) by their use in specific products, such as food-contact materials (FCM) legislation EC \n10/2011 for plastics. Meanwhile any other chemical in the polymer or in the finished material or article \nshould comply with the FCM framework regulation (EC 2004/1935) which sets out the general principles \nof safety and inertness for all FCMs. This includes all FCMs in which fluorinated polymers may be used, \nsuch as food plastics, processing equipment, coatings, paper and board, waxes, inks, and elastomers. Other \nregulations which address products in which fluorinated polymers may be used include medical devices \n(EU Regulation on Medical Devices (MDR) (2017/745) and Regulation on In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) \n(2017/746)), cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and toys. \n\nTo date, there is no regulation under REACH directly on fluorinated polymers. Intentionally used \nfluorinated polymer microplastics are, however, covered in the REACH microplastics restriction if they are \nplaced on the market in a physical form consistent with the microplastics definition, i.e. solid particles \n<5mm in size. A restriction dossier concerning the use of intentionally added microplastic particles to \nconsumer or professional products of any kind is submitted and reviewed by the Committee for Risk \nAssessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC). Currently the proposed \nmicroplastic restriction is awaiting adoption by the European Commission. All uses of polymers with these \nproperties are considered to pose a risk that is not adequately controlled if they are inevitably released to \nthe environment when used. A much greater share of microplastics, however, is from unintentional \nreleases. The microplastics dossier does not differentiate between different plastics/polymers in this \nanalysis. \n\nAt an international level, fluorinated polymers are not eligible for PLC exemption from the premanufacture notification (PMN) review process (US EPA, 2019). In Japan, fluoro groups are designated as \nreactive functional groups (RFGs) preventing a polymer from being a PLC. \n\nRisk assessment of chemicals under REACH can be performed in several ways, depending on the hazardous \nproperties of the substance. Fluorinated polymer products can change their form during different lifecycle \nstages. For these reasons, conventional risk assessment approaches for chemicals may need to be \nmodified for polymers. As the hazardous properties of fluorinated polymers are complex and, in many \ninstances, uncertain, for example, issues surrounding physical availability, bioavailability, persistence, and \ndegradation, a range of risk assessment paradigms could be considered, such as PBT/vPvB perspectives \n(non-threshold approach) and a case-by-case approach. \n\nThe hazardous potential of fluorinated polymers needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into \naccount all relevant physical, chemical, and fate properties. In a case-by-case approach for risk assessment \nof fluorinated polymers, the question is what can be referred to as their extreme persistence in the \nenvironment and the potential for this to result in a non-reversible pollution stock associated with \npotential for environmental and/or human health risks. Overall, substantial data gaps with respect to \nexposure to as well as toxicity of fluorinated polymers impede risk assessments. \n\nCurrently, most studies on the potential risks of fluorinated polymers are limited to the use phase. The \nlack of provisions covering the whole lifecycle assessment (production/use/waste management) of \nfluorinated polymers and/or their feedstocks leads to insufficient regulation as shown in previous chapters \nof this report. Therefore, in the case of fluorinated polymers, the application of a risk governance strategy \nfor the entire lifecycle, from development to end-of-life, is necessary to prevent potential risks. \n\n8.3 The IRGC risk governance framework \n\nThe IRGC Framework recommends an holistic, multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder approach to \nsupport the identification, assessment and management of risks. Furthermore, it supports processes that \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 79 \n\naim to provide and structure scientific evidence about a risk in a societal context. It helps decision makers \nanalyse the major ambiguities and controversies that may affect the management of such risks (IRGC, \n2017). \n\nFigure 8.1 shows the IRGC risk governance framework. There is a clear division between understanding a \nrisk, generating and evaluating knowledge, and deciding about a risk, decision making and management \n(IRGC, 2017, Renn, 2009). The risk governance process is structured into four distinct phases as follows: \n\n1. The first phase is the pre-assessment of a risk. This captures and describes the various perspectives \nof stakeholders and society, regarding, for instance, the use of fluorinated polymers, including \ncurrent approaches to the regulation of these substances. Moreover, this phase includes \ndetermining scientific conventions, looking for information through an early warning system and \nscreening information. \n\n2. The second phase comprises risk and concern assessment. The concern assessment includes an \nassessment of socio-economic impacts, an analysis of risk perceptions and of wider societal \nconcerns. \n\n3. The third phase focusses on knowledge characterisation and risk evaluation. In particular, risk \ninformation can be characterised as simple, complex, uncertain or ambiguous, or, most likely, a \ncombination of these. This has implications for stakeholder participation and risk management \nstrategies. \n\n4. Finally, the fourth phase of the framework focusses on risk management decision making \u2013 taking \naction to reduce and control risks. Risk management includes the generation, assessment, \nevaluation and selection of appropriate management strategies, decisions about a specific \nstrategy and alternative options, and the implementation and enforcement of such strategies. \nCross cutting issues in the framework are stakeholder participation and communication. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 80 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.1. The IRGC risk governance framework. \n\nSource: International Risk Governance Council (2017) \n\n8.4 Assessing PTFE in the risk governance process in the context of a circular economy \n\nAs fluorinated polymers are diverse to assess, this section considers PTFE, the most used fluorinated \npolymer, as an example. The first focus is on PTFE in a CE. In Section 4.1.5 the entanglement between using \nPTFE in a CE and a low-carbon and toxic-free economy is described. These concepts are obviously linked, \nas one of the main drivers for a CE is to drastically cut GHG emissions, driving Europe towards the goals \nset by the IPCC Paris Agreement (Foundation, 2019). Additionally, a toxic free/zero pollution approach is \nnecessary for achieving a truly sustainable CE. \n\nImportant characteristics for realising a CE are also found at the heart of the IRGC framework: \ncommunication, stakeholder engagement and context (Figure 8.1). \n\n8.4.1 Pre-assessment phase \n\nPTFE is first assessed using criteria suggested by the working group on identifying polymers requiring \nregistration under REACH (DG Environment (COM), 2020). This assessment is for the use of the polymer \nonly, the (circular) system or lifecycle of the polymer is not considered. Next a short evaluation of PTFE in \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 81 \n\na CE is described. This is set out against the different parts of the IRGC framework. The link with a lowcarbon toxic-free economy is described subsequently. \n\n8.4.2 Appraisal phase \n\nThe assessment of PTFE by the suggested criteria identifying polymers requiring registration (\u2018polymers of \nconcern\u2019) is shown in Figure 8.2. From this assessment it follows that PTFE is not a polymer requiring \nregistration when being considered in the use phase only. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.2. PTFE assessment for polymer requiring registration by the criteria from the (European Commission. \nDirectorate General for Environment. et al., 2020) \n\n* The exact criteria can be found in the referred report. \n\nSource: ETC/CME  \n\nThis approach for PTFE as a specific polymer indicates that it is not sufficiently risky to be of concern. As \ndescribed in the next chapter, PTFE is, however, considered to be of concern in a CE. \n\n8.4.3 Characterization and evaluation phase \n\nFrom a system perspective of a CE, PTFE appears to be of concern \u2013 see, for example, Section 7.4 in which \nthe environmental impacts of the waste stage of PTFE are described). That comes apparent when the \nwhole life cycle of PTFE is considered. The lifecycle of fluorinated polymers, including emissions, is shown \nin Figure 1.2 and a more general lifecycle of material flows in a CE is shown in the Figure 8.3 below. The \nfollowing areas of concern are identified. \n\n\u2022 Production: in the production of PTFE hazardous processing aids are used, such as Gen-X, which \ncan be released during the production, formulation or use phase (down-the-drain release from \nconsumer products) or during incineration (Section 4.9). \n\n\u2022 Use and biosphere recovery of products in the biological cycle: in a CE products are developed for \ncirculating either in a biological cycle (consumption products) or a technical cycle (service \nproducts). Consumption products in this context are those at are literally consumed during their \nlifecycle through (physical) degradation or abrasion. Examples of biological-cycle products which \nmay contain PTFE include lubricants, cosmetics and paper products. The use of PTFE in these \ncauses the release of PTFE to the environment and thus does not allow its safe degradation and \nnutrient recovery (biosphere recovery). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 82 \n\n\u2022 End-of-life treatment and recycling (technical cycle). First of all, the PTFE polymer has very strong \nchemical bonds which are not easily broken when heated. Recycling techniques used for \nconventional thermosetting plastics such as polyethylene cannot, therefore, be applied for PTFE. \nThere are some innovations to tackle this issue, for example, the university of Bayreuth has \ndeveloped a depolymerization process in cooperation with InVerTec and the 3M Dyneon company \n( 39 ). It uses pyrolysis to decompose perfluorinated polymers into gaseous monomers. After \ncleaning the latter, they are then fed back into the manufacture of new materials; a pilot plant \nwas built in 2015, however its current status is unclear. To the best knowledge of the authors of \nthis chapter, there are no other industrial recycling facilities for PTFE in operation. \n\n\u2022 The collection of PTFE polymers is challenging because it is widely used as part of a multi-layered \ncomplex products such as seals, membranes and films. Another widespread application of PTFE is \nas surface treatment or coating in which it is irreversibly connected with the base material, such \nas textile fibres. This could also hinder the recycling of the base material. Heating PTFE causes toxic \nfumes, therefore recycling techniques using higher temperatures may result in increased risks for \nworkers. \n\n\u2022 The incineration of fluoropolymers has great GHG emissions potential. \n\nIn Figure 8.3 so-called R-strategies are shown along the material flows, R1 to R6. These are developed to \nreduce the consumption of resources and materials in product chains and make the economy more \ncircular. The R-strategies typically present a range of strategies ordered from high circularity (low Rnumbers) to low circularity (high R-numbers), as a rule of thumb. These elaborate on the Ladder van \nLansink, a tool for the priority setting of waste treatment methods (Potting et al., 2017). A more detailed \nexplanation can be found in the report by Kishna et al. (2018) (only in Dutch) or for example in the study \nconducted by Morseletto et al. examining which targets can facilitate the transition to a CE (Morseletto, \n2020). Since PTFE is difficult and costly to either recycle (R5) or repair/remanufacture (R4), using this \nmaterial could hamper circular potential, as shown in Figure 8.3. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.3. A schematic view of possible flows of materials in a circular economy. \n\nSource: van Bruggen et al. (2021) \n\n \n39 https://www.plasteurope.com/news/DYNEON_t230856/ (accessed July 2021) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 83 \n\nThese above mentioned considerations and R-strategies are not part of the framework for the criteria to \nidentify and group polymers for registration/evaluation under REACH and their impact assessment \n(European Commission. Directorate General for Environment. et al., 2020), but should be taken in account \nwhen the use of PTFE is assessed in a CE. For a low carbon and toxic-free economy the R-strategies could \nalso provide valuable insights. \n\n8.4.4 Risk management phase \n\nIn a recent report by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) several \nrecommendations for the management of SVHCs in a CE have been made (van Bruggen et al., 2021; \nBeekman et al., 2020). These recommendations could also apply in a more general sense to other \nsubstances of concern including polymers. The Institute acknowledges that the economy is still \npredominantly linear and that a transition to a CE is needed. This transition provides opportunities for the \nmanagement of substances of concern and the monitoring of their use. There are three challenges. \n\nThe first is the need to share information about substances throughout the entire product chain. In a \ncircular economy products and materials, including the substances they contain, are used as inputs for a \ncircular loop. Consequently, it is crucial that there is access to information across the product chain about \nthe substances used and their safety. Currently, this information is available at the production phase of \nfluorinated polymers, but lost further down the chain. \n\nThe second challenge is for various parties in the chain to take responsibility for the safe use and re-use of \nsubstances in materials and products. Manufacturers have a responsibility for safe and sustainable design. \nThis implies that products are designed with the aim of safe use and re-use depending on their \npredetermined application. Moreover, users and companies further down the chain have a responsibility \nfor safe use and recycling and they must be enabled to take it. \n\nAs becomes clear from the description of the different phases of the IRGC Framework in the governance \nof substances in a CE, communication and stakeholder participation is needed in all phases of the process. \nThe description above shows that this also holds for the processes needed for risk management in a CE. \nAlthough the IRGC framework is not specifically designed for one, the communication and stakeholder \nparticipation in the framework support the challenges identified. \n\nThe third and final challenge concerns the responsible management of substances in a CE, when phasing \nout is impossible or no longer possible. Within these substances, a distinction is made between: \n\na. legacy substances: those that are no longer allowed in new products but are still present in \nproducts in circulation, such as the presence of PFOA in existing sprinkler installations; \n\nb. essential uses: for certain applications \u2013 certainly in the short and medium term \u2013 substances of \nconcern are necessary because of their specific functionality and therefore cannot be phased out \ncompletely; \n\nc. as yet unknown substances of concern: harmful effects usually only become clear (long) after the \nintroduction of new substances \u2013 as knowledge continues to develop, substances that are not yet \na cause for concern may, in the future, be classified as SVHCs; \n\nd. changes in the use of essential substances of concern due to developments in society: as a result \nof the rapid development of innovations, but also due to changing requirements imposed by \nsociety, there may be shifts in the demand for and supply of substances. \n\nIn Beekman et al. (2020) several examples are given of the above mentioned categories (Beekman et al., \n2020). \n\nThe above mentioned RIVM report also provides an analysis of possible indicators and sources of \ninformation for monitoring SVHCs in a CE. A distinction is made between process indicators and effect \nindicators. Some of these may be operational in the short term because they are based on information \nwhich is currently available. Others call for the active collection of additional information that is currently \nnot available or only partially. To obtain a comprehensive picture of hazardous substances in a CE, it is \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 84 \n\nimportant to start monitoring wherever possible and, at the same time, work on obtaining additional \ninformation that is not yetavailable. In a sequel report, a method for the monitoring of hazardous \nsubstances (Dutch, ZZS) in a CE is proposed (van Bruggen et al., 2021). \n\nMonitoring fluoropolymers, or PFAS, in a CE is necessary because of environmental and possible human \nhazards as mentioned in Section 4.1.3, and because of related GHG emissions over their lifecycle as shown \nin this report. To make just considerations on their human and environmental impacts of material/product \nflows, transparent data is essential. Probably several indicators are needed and identified knowledge gaps \nalong the lifecycle of fluorinated polymers (Table 9.1) should be filled as soon as possible. \n\n8.4.5 PTFE use in solar photovoltaic panels \n\nPTFE has many applications including use in renewable energy applications (Sections 6.1; 7.3; and 7.5). For \nexample, many solar photovoltaic (PV) panels have a backsheet coated with PTFE. The PTFE on the \nbacksheet is difficult to recycle which hampers the circular possibilities of a solar PV panel. The backsheet \nmaterial can also be from glass or (bio)PET alternatives, which do not need a PTFE coating. Using glass \nmight initially be more expensive, but it improves the recyclability of the panel significantly, and thereby \nits circular potential, decreasing the overall environmental burden. Significant GHG are produced in the \nproduction and end-of-life treatment of the PTFE in solar PVs, just like in a linear economy. This does not \nfit well with the aim of a low carbon economy minimising emissions of GHG. Next to that, difficulties to \nproperly recycle or reuse the PTFE makes it difficult to keep it in different product cycles, without being \nwasted. And, as already mentioned, the widespread use of PTFE is a real challenge and difficult to justify \nin a toxic-free economy. The transition towards renewable energy is obviously necessary but the \nperspective of the whole system should be considered all along the way. Sustainable applications should \nbe able to be circular and toxic-free over their entire lifecycles. This holds especially for such non-crucial \nparts as a solar PV backsheet for which circular design is already an option (Contreras-Lisperguer et al., \n2021). \n\nTo realize the EU Green Deal ideals of a circular, low carbon and pollutant-free economy, renewable energy \nsolutions should be safe and sustainable by design (see the CSS) (EC, 2020). Using a material like PTFE in \nsolar PV solutions seems not to be in line with these ambitions. \n\nExamples of (truly) sustainable energy production provide a link between the concept of essential use and \nthe concepts of a low-carbon, circular and toxic-free economy. Benefits and burdens of PTFE use can only \nbe compared by performing an integrated assessment covering the environmental and human impacts \nduring the whole lifecycle. \n\n8.5 Applying the concept of essential use in the risk governance process \n\n8.5.1 The concept of essential use in the European Chemical Strategy for Sustainability towards \ntoxic free environment \n\nThe concept of essential use has been introduced in CSS, a document of the European Commission (EC, \n2020) providing a long-term vision for the EU chemicals policy. The CSS suggests the adoption of a generic \napproach to risk management of particularly harmful chemicals used in consumer products unless their \nuse is deemed to be essential. Specific attention is given to the use of PFAS due to their ubiquitous use \nand global exposure which is considered to lead to expected yearly health related costs of EUR 52-84 billion \n(Goldenman et al. 2019). \n\nIn the CSS, the European Commission proposes a ban of PFAS manufacture and use within Europe, \nexempting those uses that are considered essential from a societal perspective (EP, 2021). This, obviously, \npresupposes that criteria of essentiality can both be defined and operationalized in a non-ambiguous way. \nRegarding the definition of and possible criteria for defining essentiality, the CSS refers to the Montreal \nProtocol, a multilateral environmental agreement for phasing-out ozone-depleting substances, in which \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 85 \n\ncriteria for essential use have been specified and applied to a few exceptional cases (Protocol, 1987) (40). \nSpecifically, the Protocol states in Decision IV/25 that \u201ca use of a controlled substance should qualify as \n\u2018essential\u2019 if and only if (i) it is necessary for the health, safety or is critical for the functioning of society \n(encompassing cultural and intellectual aspects); and (ii) there are no available technically and \neconomically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment \nand health\u201d (Figure 8.4). \n\n \n\nFigure 8.4. Criteria for essential use of chemicals as specified in the Montreal Protocol. \n\nSource: Montreal Protocol (1987). \n\nThis implies that exemptions from control measures such as bans lead to societal benefits because of the \nessentiality and must be balanced against the consequences of such exemptions, in particular the costs of \nswitching to safe(r) chemicals or technologies and negative impacts due on-going emissions. Identifying \nthe use of a chemical of concern as essential is, therefore, a sufficient but not a necessary condition for its \nongoing use. The obvious need for balanced decision making has also been adopted in REACH (ECHA, 2011; \n2008), under which detailed information about alternative substances and technologies is mandatory in \norder to come to an informed decision about authorisation \u2013 the formal approval to continue one or \nseveral uses of a SVHC for a defined period) \u2013 and is used in the decision-process to assess the benefits \nand costs of the proposed restriction \u2013 the enforcement of control measures to eliminate the risks from \nproducing, manufacturing or marketing a substance \u2013 of chemicals. \n\nFor PFAS in particular, Cousins et al. (2019) suggested to distinguish essential from substitutable and nonessential uses. While the first two categories differ only with regard to the availability or lack of alternative \nsubstances and technologies, the latter category denotes uses that are \u201cpurely driven by market \nopportunity\u201d (Cousins et al., 2019). Similar to the Montreal Protocol, they assume chemical uses \ncontributing to health and safety, for example occupational medical clothing, are likely to be essential. \nDental floss or ski waxes, on the contrary, are considered non-essential because these uses do not \ncontribute to health and safety purposes. In contrast to the Montreal Protocol, Cousins et al. (2019) do \nnot consider the economic and technical feasibility (functionality) of alternatives, and the potential \nenvironmental implications of alternative chemicals or technologies. \n\nSo far, there is no consensus on the criteria for determining essential use, and how to distinguish essential \nfrom non-essential ones of chemicals in consumer products. While criteria such as health and safety have \nalready been adopted in the Montreal Protocol and are also likely to receive broad acceptance for risk \ngovernance of harmful chemicals in consumer products, it is largely unclear whether there are other \ncriteria reflecting societal preferences or values considered essential. In addition, it is unclear what criteria \ncould identify uses that are critical for the functioning of society. Other relevant questions are who should \ndecide on these criteria, and how to assess whether or not one or several criteria are met. Moreover, it \nhas been recognised that societal opinions about what defines the use of a harmful chemical as essential \n\n \n40 https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol/ \n\n\u2022 It is necessary for health\n\n\u2022 It is necessary for safety\n\u2022 It is necessary for other highly relevant \n\npurposes\n\n\u2022 It is critical for the functioning of society\n\n\u2022 There are no technical and economically \n\nfeasible alternatives\n\u2022 There are no alternatives/substitutes \n\nwhich are acceptable from the standpoint \n\nof environment and health\n\u2022 There are no alternatives/substitutes that \n\nprovide the necessary technical function \nand performance\n\nAND\n\nBenefits side of chemical use Cost side of chemical use\n\nhttps://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol/meetings/fourth-meeting-parties-montreal-protocol/decisions/decision-4\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 86 \n\nor critical are probably not static but can change over time and are influenced by culture (Bouman et al., \n2021, EuropeanCommission, 2020). Addressing these issues is, therefore, not trivial because, obviously, \nthe identification of criteria is value-driven and the consequences of an implementation of any criteria can \nhave substantial impacts on society. Note that these challenges are not new, and different scientific \ndisciplines, including social psychology and economics, have proposed methodologies of how the \nunderlying challenge of value, preference elicitation and prioritization, can be approached (Schwartz, \n2017; Schwartz, 2012; Dietz et al., 2005; Cameron et al., 2002; Fischhoff, 1996). \n\nWhile discussing the practical implementation of the concept of essential use for risk governance of \nfluorinated polymers does not seem not meaningful in the absence of relevant criteria, it is possible to \ndiscuss possible implications of using the concept in the risk governance process using the risk governance \nframework suggested by the IRGC as reference. In particular, the implications of essential use \nconsiderations implemented early or late in the risk governance process are included. \n\nOne possible option for improving current risk governance and legislation, such as REACH, of fluorinated \npolymers is the implementation of the essential use concept in the risk management procedure. The IRGC \nframework could be used as a reference with the aim of providing a balanced overview of the implications \nof applying the concept of essential use. \n\n8.5.1.1 Pre-assessment phase \n\nAn inventory of the uses of fluorinated polymers can be conducted during the pre-assessment phase. \nAssuming that criteria reflecting a societal consensus on essential uses of fluorinated polymers can be \ndefined, and that these are based on a societal consensus, the uses which are, according to these criteria, \nnot essential, can be identified. Defining non-essential uses early in the risk governance process implies \nthat time- and resource-demanding follow-up steps such as hazard identification, exposure/vulnerability \nassessment and risk characterisation (first part of the appraisal phase) may no longer be required for these \nuses. Furthermore, an assessment of impacts could become redundant. The expectation is that this will \nsimplify and accelerate the risk governance process. Hence, filtering out some uses of fluorinated polymers \nearly in the risk governance process may be resource saving and accelerate risk management decision \nmaking about these substances. It should be noted, however, that considering uses of fluorinated \npolymers to be non-essential could also imply that possible benefits of these uses will be lost. This, \nhowever, occurs at the expense of in-depth insights into positive and negative impacts of such uses. In \nother words: non-essentiality criteria define a use to be socially irrelevant from the outset. This implies \nthat the spheres of understanding and deciding (Figure 8.2) that are traditionally well delineated will \nbecome entangled. \n\n8.5.1.2 Appraisal phase \n\nIf non-essential uses are excluded in the pre-assessment phase, a detailed assessment of concerns would \nthen focus on essential uses only in the appraisal phase of risk governance. A concern is a multidimensional concept and includes a proper understanding of stakeholder perceptions and a systematic \nanalysis of socio-economic impacts of the use of fluorinated polymers. It is important to note that impacts \ndo not only arise from an on-going use of fluorinated polymers, but can also emerge from implementing \nrisk management measures, for example through the use of alternative substances or technologies. \nConsequently, identifying fluorinated polymer uses that are deemed to be essential does not overcome \nthe need to assess and balance different types of impacts in order to approve a continued use. In \nparticular, essentiality is not a cutoff criterion for unbound continued use. Rather, acknowledging that \ncriteria of essentiality reflect the benefits side of chemical use (i.e. the societal goals or values to which a \ncertain use contributes), these benefits must be contrasted with the negative impacts of a use on human \nhealth, the environment or the economy. Likewise, assessing costs and impacts of potential alternative \nsubstances and technologies remains crucial to stimulate innovation towards safe(r) alternatives on one \nhand, and to prevent regrettable substitution on the other. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 87 \n\nAnother option is to introduce criteria of essential use slightly later in the risk governance process; in the \nappraisal phase. The question is, then, in what way criteria of essential use can complement or support \nthe assessment of concerns and socio-economic impacts. Under REACH, socio-economic analysis (SEA) has \nbecome a well-established toolbox for conducting such assessments for REACH authorisation and \nrestriction procedures, but also beyond (Garc\u00eda-Ayll\u00f3n, 2019; Georgiou et al., 2018; Pery et al., 2013). \nAdopting a social welfare perspective, SEA is a comprehensive and comprehensible assessment toolbox \nthat seeks to assess and compare all impacts with an expected welfare effect. In applications for \nauthorisation, SEA is informed by an analysis of alternatives (AoA), in which applicants have to identify \navailable alternatives and provide an assessment of their technical and economic feasibility and the time \nscale for the implementation of possible alternatives (ECHA, 2021). In reality, however, impacts have not \nalways been straightforward to quantify and to monetise. Specifically, environmental impacts have often \nbeen assessed qualitatively only due to a lack of data and a lack of methodological integration of the \navailable information about chemical properties into economic methods (Gabbert and Hilber, 2020). While \nin the absence of quantitative data the use of qualitative reasoning is a legitimate way forward, it still \nrequires that the key characteristics of a concern, such as high or extreme persistence, are appropriately \ntransported in the overall balancing of impacts. Similarly, the quality of AoA\u2019s have often been a matter of \ndebate since applicants have not always been able to convincingly show that alternatives were lacking, or \nnot feasible from a technical or economic point of view (Navin-Jones, 2019). This led to criticism of some \ndecisions on granting authorisation to chemicals, and of exemptions from restrictions (Tickner and Jacobs, \n2016), as it was argued that these uses were not necessary for social health and safety. This implies that \nthere is probably scope for improvement of specific components in SEAs. Environmental impact \nassessment in SEAs, for example, could be strengthened by developing integrated methods linking \nenvironmental data and assessments using economic methods (Gabbert and Hilber, 2020). This requires, \nfirst and foremost, close interdisciplinary collaboration. \n\nWhere it is possible to address all relevant impacts quantitatively, for example, by means of a cost-benefit \nanalysis, it is debatable whether the underlying efficiency argument of welfare economics is always the \nbest or only argument for deciding about chemicals\u2019 use. In law and ordinary moral reasoning, the \navoidance of harm, the benefits of risk management measures, can have priority over the provision of \ncosts (Geistfeld, 2019; Keating, 2018,). Within the welfare economic SEA approach such preferences can \nbe reflected by attaching higher weight to the benefits compared to the costs involved in taking measures \nto avoid risks and, ultimately, damage. \n\nPrioritising the avoidance of harm may be regarded as the added value of essential use in comparison to \nexisting regulatory frameworks. This holds predominantly for those regulatory frameworks which lack a \ntransparent, method-based approach for assessing and balancing impacts such as a SEA, for example the \nEuropean Biocidal Products Regulation (41). It can also reflect different normative perspectives on how to \nmanage the risks arising from chemicals\u2019 use. Research on expert roles in policy advice illustrates that \nthere exist different interpretations of precaution, and can therefore also reach different conclusions on \nhow to deal with risk and uncertainty (Spruijt et al., 2016; Silva and Jenkins\u2010Smith, 2007; Weiss, 2003). This \ndepends on the decision context and the specific problem at hand. By including the concept of essential \nuse in regulatory frameworks, in particular for most hazardous substances in a CE, the (societal) voice of \nthose who prefer to act on the side of caution may be strengthened. \n\n8.5.1.3 Characterization and evaluation phase \n\nIn the risk evaluation phase, the evidence based on the risk and concern assessment is combined with a \nthorough evaluation of other factors which have not already been included in the analysis of concern. Such \nfactors can include societal values, economic and political considerations provided that they have not \nexplicitly been addressed in the assessment of concerns. Risks can be acceptable (no risk reduction \nneeded), tolerable (because of benefits, but risk reduction measures are needed) or intolerable (risks \nshould simply be avoided). Again, criteria of essential use can provide information about basic, \n\n \n41 EUR-Lex - 32012R0528 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu) \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012R0528\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 88 \n\nundisputable social values. If applied in the evaluation phase of the risk governance process, the concept \nof essential use does not impact the hazard, risk or impact assessment process. Rather, it can provide an \nalert to policy-makers to explicitly consider these values when adopting risk management decisions. \n\n8.5.1.4 Risk management phase \n\nBased on the considerations above, Figure 8.5 illustrates two options for the implementation of the \nconcept of essential use. The first option (Figure 8.5a) requires an a priori definition of criteria, based on a \nsocietal consensus. If applied early in the risk governance process, this might help to reduce resources \nrequired for a hazard, risk or impact assessment, and might speed up decision making. At the same time, \nthis approach will lead to less information about hazardous effects, risks and impacts of chemicals. \nFurthermore, regular and EU-wide update-assessments of essentiality criteria will be needed to ensure \nobjectivity and relevance of the concept over time. \n\nIn Figure 8.5b criteria of essential use are defined after the regulatory assessments. The benefit of such an \napproach could be that the concept of essential use is only needed for uses without good alternatives; \nmany issues might already have been solved in the socio-economic assessment in the appraisal phase. This \nwill answer the needs of those who prefer precaution over the balancing of positive and negative impacts \nin risk management, as it corrects undesirable outcomes of a SEA. Moreover, with this order it is possible \nto keep the distinction between the understanding and deciding spheres in risk governance. The \ndisadvantage is that this is a case-by-case approach in which the assessment of hazards, risks and impacts \nis not accelerated. \n\nFigures 8.5a and b illustrate two possible options for the implementation of the concept of essential use. \nOther options, including parallel or iterative assessments, could be explored. As shown, the way the \nconcept of essential use is implemented, will affect other parts of the management of the risks of \n(hazardous) chemicals. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.5a.

Adding essential use (in yellow) after regulatory assessments. \n\n8.6 Discussion and Conclusion \n\nThis chapter discussed key elements of risk governance of fluorinated polymers in a CE and reflected on \npossible options for applying the concept of essential use. \n\nThe IRGC framework supports the idea that the inclusion of stakeholders during all phases of the \ngovernance process is needed in a CE. This need is amplified by the assessment of PTFE using the proposed \ncriteria for evaluation of polymers of concern. In there, only the possible hazards of the polymer during \nthe use phase are assessed. It shows that this is too shallow in the framework of a CE. Therefore, the whole \nlifecycle should be assessed, including, for example, persistency and leakage to the biosphere. To realise \nthe EU Green Deal ideals of a circular, low carbon and chemical pollution-free economy, the benefits and \nburdens of, for example, PTFE use could only be assessed using an integrated assessment. This should \ncover the environmental and human impacts of the chemical\u2019s entire lifecycle, including GHG potential.  \nAn integrated assessment also provides a link between the concept of essential use and the concepts of a \nlow-carbon, circular and toxic-free economy. \n\nLinking the concept of essential use to risk governance, it is concluded that there can be different options \nin implementing criteria of essential use, assuming that they have been defined unambiguously. \nSpecifically, criteria can be applied at an early stage, even prior to a case-by-case hazard, risk or impact \nassessment. This can help to reduce resources, time and, ultimately, costs because chemicals in nonessential uses can be removed from the market immediately. The assessment of hazards, risks and socioeconomic impacts will, then, focus on those chemicals which are part of essential uses. Well-defined \ncriteria of essential use could, therefore, provide more opportunities for risk governance of fluorinated \npolymers than are currently used in the EU. This also implies, however, less information and data about \nhazards, risks or impacts for chemicals in non-essential uses. There can, therefore, also be arguments in \nfavour of using criteria for essential use at a later stage of the risk governance process. Given this tradeoff, decision making on what route to take requires a thorough assessment of all impacts that can be \nexpected under either route. The discussion also highlights that criteria of essential use cannot not \novercome the need for assessing the impacts of possible regulatory decisions on harmful chemicals. \nFurthermore, while applying the concept of essential use may strengthen the inclusion of societal norms \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 90 \n\nand perspectives, its operationalisation largely depends on the specification of suitable criteria of \nessentiality or non-essentiality. Finally, assuming those criteria have been defined, regular and EU-wide \nupdates of societal preferences on essential uses are needed to ensure the objectivity and relevance of \nthe concept in the long-run. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 91 \n\n9 Key gaps in knowledge \n\nIn previous chapters the impacts of fluorinated polymers along their lifecycles have been evaluated mainly \nbased on data from literature. Fluorinated polymers may currently have important uses related to \nrenewable energy and increasing the durability and performance of products that create benefits for \nsociety. As illustrated in the report, however, the fluorinated polymer lifecycle also shows risks for the \nenvironment and human health, including some related to climate change impacts, which question their \noverall benefits. At this stage the information is rather limited on both the benefits and the risks, but the \nseverity of the potential impacts, including the immensely high GWP of fluorinated gases, warrants further \nstudies on lifecycle emissions. These would help to assess whether fluorinated polymers contribute or \nblock goals of a circular, toxic-free and low-carbon economy, and whether uses really can be considered \nessential. Reliable information is needed on flows, amounts, markets, exposures to human and the \nenvironment, replacement alternatives, and economic aspects related to different use areas for potential \naction on risk governance of fluorinated polymers at different stages. Knowledge gaps along the lifecycle \nhave been collated in Table 9.1. \n\nKey gaps in knowledge and regulations, and need for action were identified as follows. \n\n\u2022 Data streams on feedstock and intermediate chemicals at product or at least industry level in \nEurope, as well as for products imported into Europe. \n\n\u2022 Studies/research/monitoring on substances (feedstock, synthesis by-products, impurities and \ndegradation products) that are emitted from all types of activities along the lifecycle of fluorinated \npolymers (production, manufacturing of products, incineration/thermal degradation/wastewater \ntreatment, etc.). Key knowledge gaps are analyses of volatile fluorinated gases and oligomers. \n\n\u2022 Research on degradation pathways of these fluorinated substances, to assess to which extent \ndegradation products with high GWP are formed. Degradation during production, use, end-of-life \nand in the environment are relevant for such studies. \n\n\u2022 Studies to assess whether the GWP can be calculated based on the emissions along the lifecycle \nof a chemical and not only on the chemical itself, as it is done now. \n\n\u2022 More systematic studies on emissions of FTOHs and other PFAS from, for example, wastewater \ntreatment plants and manufacturing sites. \n\n\u2022 Research and demonstration of technologies to recycle fluorinated polymers from waste, both \nduring the production phases and from end-of-life products. Demonstrations would have to \nconsider how recycling is done in practice, including for wastes shipped outside Europe. \n\n\u2022 Systematic and in-depth analyses on benefits and risks associated with the use of fluorinated \npolymers in different applications. Potentially, tools and criteria, which currently are being \ndeveloped for ensuring safe and sustainable design, can be used in combination with a framework \nfor essential versus non-essential uses.

Supplementary information on production of HF and environmental \nrisks in fluorspar extraction \n\nA1.1 From acid-grade fluorspar to hydrofluoric acid \n\nThe excavated ore, either from open pit or underground mines, are concentrated by flotation techniques. \nThe ore is grounded to fine particles, for example below 150 \u00b5m. The process is conducted in a series of \ncells that successively concentrates the ore from the feed material (CaF2 concentrations in the feed \ndepends on the deposit, in the literature examples of 30\u201340% are mentioned) to a minimum of 97.0% CaF2 \nin the final concentrate. The water in the final product is then removed in a thickener and a rotary drum \nfilter. Tailings generated from flotation (non-recovered ore material remaining) are usually disposed of in \ntailings ponds as an aqueous slurry. In the tailing ponds the settled water is recycled to the plant for reuse. \n(Fluorine Forum 2019; Kiptanui, 2015). \n\nAs mined, fluorspar ore contains host rock and other inert impurities, together with varying amounts of \nlead, silver or zinc ores. The minerals that are not wanted together with impurities including also \nunextracted fluorine end up in the tailings ponds. An example of flows processed per operating days at \nCavendish Mill (Fluorine Forum 2019) are: \n\n- typically 1 310 tonnes per day of polymetallic fluorspar ore containing 28% CaF2 is processed \n(impurities: 1.79% lead); \n\n- 250 tonnes of acid grade fluorspar concentrate are produced per day (together with 20 tonnes of \nlead, 40 tonnes of barytes and 300 tonnes of crushed stone aggregate are formed as by-products); \n\n- about 700 tonnes of tailings are generated per day containing 5% CaF2 in coarse fraction (250 \ntonnes/day) and 12% CaF2 in fine fraction (450 tonnes/day). \n\nAfter flotation, the acid grade fluorspar is transported to plants for the production of HF. In the process, \nthe fluorspar is reacted with sulphuric acid (H2SO4) in an endothermic process to form HF. The hot solid \ncalcium sulphate residues are removed and neutralised at the opposite end of the HF reactor. Gypsum is \nsold to the building industry for use as a floor-levelling material, building blocks and as a retarder in the \ncement industry. (BUSS ChemTech, n.d.; Eurofluor, n.d.) \n\nA1.2 Environmental and health impacts from extraction of fluorspar \u2013 examples \n\nSustainable sourcing is recognised as important in the EU in the manufacture of products starting from \nraw material extraction and it takes into account environmental and health concerns as well as social and \neconomic issues. Uncontrolled mining activities, such as small-scale unregualted mining and a lack of use \nof tools for protecting of health and safety, are also linked to the lack of environmental protection \nmeasures. Google Maps\u2019 images of Mongolia show dust deposition ranging several kilometres downwind \nof mining areas, and also evidence of large animal herds using tailings ponds as their main source of \ndrinking water (Baatar and Grayson, 2009; Grayson, 2009). \n\nA special health impact relates to the intake of drinking water with ahigh fluoride content from the ion \nexchange processes and the weathering of the rock. At mining sites, dust formation related to mining \nactivities (for example, spillage and tailings) increase the exposure of human and animals, although, in the \nliterature, this is only reported for coal rather than fluorspar mining. For example, in Mongolia fluoride \nconcentrations around 2 mg/l in drinking water (42) occur in concentrations which cause health problems \nsuch as dental fluorosis \u2013 in several areas near deposits about half of the children have dental fluorosis \u2013 \nand skeletal fluorosis, which is not curable. Elevated fluoride may also lead to intellectual deficits that can \nbe considerable (Grandjean, 2019; Grayson et al., 2016). \n\n \n42 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends for fluoride concentration in drinking water should not exceed 1.5 mg/l \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 115 \n\nA special concern also relates to the stability of tailings. A few acciditents involving leackage from tailings \nponds have been reported. In 1985, a tailings dam of the Prestavel fluorite mine, near Tesero (Trento) in \nnorthern Italy, failed, causing a disastrous mudflow involving 180,000 m3 of semi-fluid tailings which \nrapidly flowed over 4.2 km along the Stava Valley until it reached the river. In this catastrophe, 268 lives \nwere lost and 20 people injuried (Luino et al., 2012; Chandler et al., 1995). Another, tailings pond accident \nhappened 2007 at the Derby fluorine mine in UK where a failure in a tailings dam caused a release of 20 \n000 m3 tailings, slightly increasing concetrations in soil immediately beneath the tailings deposit (Anon. \n2007). \n\nThe host rock of fluorspar may contain impurities, such as lead, arscenic and zinc, that ends up in the \ntailings, along with non-extractive fluorine remains. Tailings are disposed in tailings pond; typically tailings \nare pumped as a slurry to huge tailings ponds from which leaks may occur into the surrounding \nenvironment. It is also possible that the tailings from fluorspar are acid generating (43) which affects the \naquatic ecosystem and produce contamination and even health effects on humans and livestock. It is \nimportant that ponds are covered when they are full to avoid risk of dust spreading into the environment. \n\nUnderground fluorite mining produces a relatively large volume of polluted water that need to be removed \nfrom the mines during the extraction operation. If these effluents are discharged into a water body \nuntreated, the water body may become polluted with heavy metals and fluoride. In Asturias situated in \nnorthwest Spain each year, for example, approximately 200 000 m3 of wastewater from a fluorspar mine \nis discharged into a nearby stream, which results in fluoride concentrations of up to 4.8 mg/l (Roque\u00f1\u00ed et \nal, 2005). \n\nThe faulty exploitation of some Chinese deposits that has caused some mine closures due to \nenvironmental concerns is mentioned in the SCRREEN report (Karhu et al., 2018), but without further \ndetails. \n\nThe following are examples of environmental and health impacts connected with heavy metal pollution \npresented in recent literature. \n\n\u2022 Spain: Forj\u00e1n et al. (2019) found that the former and current fluorspar mining on the northern \ncoast of Spain has resulted in increased levels of mercury in soils and sediments near the mine as \na result of the inappropriate disposal of processing waste. \n\n\u2022 Kenya: increased levels of fluoride have been found in animal meat and plants around a fluorspar \nmine in Kenya \u2013 the exposure was assumed to result from poorly treated wastewater from the \nmine (Kibet et al., 2019). Fluorite mining there has had major impacts on the physical environment \nwith changes in topography and vegetation cover. \n\n\u2022 Tunisia: an old fluorite (CaF2) and barite (BaSO4) mine is located in Hammam Zriba, northern \nTunisia. As a result of the wind erosion of the tailings and their subsequent wind transport, \nextreme concentrations were measured in soils near to the tailings dumps: 5% barium, 4% \nstrontium, 7% sulphur, 1% fluorine, 0.8 % zinc and 0.2% lead. Concentrations of the major \npollutants decrease with distance, but they were high even in the farthest samples, situated 2 km \ndownstream from the mining wastes dumping area (Djebbi et al., 2017). \n\n\u2022 Pakistan: Rashid et al. (2018) concluded that the groundwater in villages near a fluorspar mine was \nnot fit to drink. Of analysed groundwater samples, 62.2 % exceeded the WHO limit value of 1.5 \nmg/l for drinking water. The elevated concentrations, typically 1.5\u20133 mg/l, were due to the \nweathering of rock and ion exchange processes. \n\n \n43 Acid generation occur when sulphides in the tailings are oxides to sulphuric acid and there is a lack of neutralising minerals. Acid \n\nmining drainage (AMD) is produced when sulphide-bearing material is exposed to oxygen and water. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 116 \n\nAnnex 2.

A non-exhaustive list of of different international and European \nregulations on PFAS \n\nInternational and EU legislation provides a means of controlling PFAS pollution and protecting the \nenvironment and human health. Table A10 provides a (non-exhaustive) summary of different international \nand European legislation on PFAS. Since the detection of PFAS in human and environmental samples in the \n1970s, European Directives and Regulations have provided indirect protective measures by establishing \ngeneral rules for a range of PFAS, particularly PFOA and PFOS. These include the 1986 Sewage Sludge \nDirective (86/278/EEC); the 1998 Drinking Water Directive (DWD) (98/83/EC); the 2000 Water Framework \nDirective (WFD) (2000/60/EC); the 2004 Food Contact Materials Regulation (No. 1935/2004); the 2004 \nPersistent Organic Pollutants Regulation (No850/2004 in 2004); and the 2006 Groundwater Directive \n(2006/118/EC). \n\nFurthermore, the EU legislative restrictions, including amendments of previous frameworks as well as \nfuture strategies, specifically mention PFAS. The main legislative documents are the following. \n\n- In 2008, EC No 1272/2008 Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and \nmixtures (the CLP Regulation), the WFD (2008/98/EC) and Environmental Quality Standards \nDirective (EQSD) (2008/105/EC). \n\n- In 2010, the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) (Directive 2010/75/EU), covering the \nmanagement of the PFAS emissions from industrial sources. \n\n- In 2011, the Plastic Materials Regulation (No 10/2011). \n- In 2013, the Directive 2013/39/EU, which amended the WFD and the EQSD, provided harmonised \n\nguidelines for risk assessment and monitoring of priority substances. \n- In 2017, first REACH restriction on PFOA. \n\nTable A10. Overview of some of European Economic Area legislation covering PFAS. \n\nRegulation Description How PFAS are regulated \n\nEuropean Regulation (EC) No. \n1272/2008 on classification, \nlabelling and packaging of \nsubstances and mixtures (the CLP \nRegulation) \n\nThe CLP Regulation harmonises the \ncriteria for classification (CLH) of \nsubstances and mixtures, and the rules \nfor labelling and packaging of these \nhazardous substances and mixtures. The \nclassification of a substance can also \ndetermine how substances are covered \nunder other \u2018downstream\u2019 legislation.  \n\nA few PFAS (e.g. PFOA, PFDA, PFNA) \nare subject to harmonised \nclassification under the CLP.  \n\nThe Public Activities Coordination \nTool (PACT) \n\nProvides an overview of the substancespecific activities being undertaken by \nauthorities under the REACH Regulation \nand the CLP Regulation. \n\n21 different PFAS species are listed \non the PACT list.  \n\nCouncil Directive 98/24/EC on the \nprotection of the health and safety \nof workers from the risks related to \nchemical agents at work (the \nChemical Agents Directive (CAD)) \n\nOutlines the minimum requirements for \nthe protection of workers\u2019 health and \nsafety arising, or likely to arise, from the \neffects of chemical agents in the \nworkplace or the use of chemical agents \nat work. Indicative occupational \nexposure limit values (IOELVs) are set at \na European Economic Area (EEA) level.  \n\n10 individual PFAS are covered by \nthe CAD. \n\nPlant Protection Products \nRegulation (EC) No 1107/2009 \n\n Several PFAS (approximately 37) for \nactive substances in plant protection \nproducts for which the CLH process \nhas been finished or is still ongoing. \nThree of those 37 are listed as being \nactive substances in plant protection \nas well as biocidal products.  \n\nBiocidal Product Regulation (EU) No \n528/2012 and amendments \n\n 11 biocidal active substances \ncontain an aliphatic CF2- or CF3- unit \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 121 \n\nRegulation Description How PFAS are regulated \n\n(PFAS). Nine of these substances are \ncurrently approved as biocidal active \nsubstances and include the product \ntypes PT18 (insecticides), PT08 \n(wood preservatives), PT14 \n(rodenticides), PT07 (film \npreservatives), PT09 (fibre, leather, \nrubber and polymer preservatives) \nand PT10 (building material \npreservatives) and/or PT 21 \n(antifouling agents). \n\nDirective 2008/98/EC \n(the Waste Framework Directive) \n\nLays down the measures to prevent or \nreduce the adverse impacts of the \ngeneration and management of waste \nby reducing resource use and improving \nefficiency of use. The properties of \nwaste which render it hazardous are \noutlined in Annex III. \n\nSeveral PFAS (including PFHxS, PFBA, \nPFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA and PFBS) \nmeet the criteria for properties of \nwaste which render it hazardous \nunder Annex III of the WFD. \n\nDirective 2013/39/EEA as regards \npriority substances in the field of \nwater policy (the Water Framework \nDirective) \n\nSets environmental quality standards \n(EQS) for priority substances listed \nunder the WFD. \n\nPFOS and PFOA are listed as priority \nhazardous substances and have set \nEQS values. \n\nDirective 98/83/EC on the quality of \nwater intended for human \nconsumption (the Drinking Water \nDirective) \n\nEU Member States to set quality \nstandard values for the parameters that \nare set in Annex I, be that microbial or \nchemical. Regular monitoring is a \nrequirement of this Directive, as is \nremedial action. \n\n>70 individual PFAS species covered \nby the DWD. \n\n \n\nREACH: Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \n\nThe European chemicals legislation REACH includes two complementary regulatory instruments for \nmanaging the risks of hazardous chemicals: (a) authorisation, which is a formal approval to continue a \nspecific use of a substance being classified as an SVHC (45) for a defined period, and (b) restriction, which \nis the adoption of measures to reduce or eliminate the risks from production, manufacture and marketing \nof a substance at an European-wide level. An authorisation is initiated by companies, who can apply for \npermission to continue using an SVHC beyond a pre-defined end date. Restriction procedures can be \ninitiated by Member States\u2019 regulatory authorities or by the ECHA at the request of the EC and can be \napplied to any substance, including, but not necessarily, SVHCs. For both regulatory instruments the \nEuropean Commission takes the final decision on adopting risk management measures, based on the \nwritten opinions of the ECHA\u2019s RAC and SEAC. \n\nThe EU restricted the industrial manufacture and use of PFOS and then PFOA under the REACH Regulation \n(No 1907/2006, No 522/2009; Commission Regulation 2017/1000). On 4 July 2020, based on the SVHC \nCandidate List, restrictions on the use, import and production of PFOA, its salts and derivatives came into \neffect with thresholds specific to their applications (No 2019/1021, No 2020/784). \n\nThe SVHC Candidate List also includes other PFAS (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTDA) due \nto their vPvB or PBT properties. PFHxA and PFHxS, the latter used as alternative to PFOA, have been \nproposed as candidates for the list under the REACH restrictions. Two more PFAS were proposed for \neventual inclusion in the Restriction Annex XIV of REACH within the SVHC Candidate List: PFBS and 2,3,3,3- \ntetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propionic acid, its salts and acyl halides (HFPO-DA), which have been \nused as substitutes of PFOS and PFOA, respectively (ECHA, 2020; 2020b). Further safety measures to \n\n \n45 SVHCs are chemicals which are classified as one of the following (a) carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction; (b) \n\npersistent, bioaccumulative or toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB), (c) endocrine disrupters; or \nsubstances that (d) give \u201crise to an equivalent level of concern\u201d (EC 2006, Article 57). \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 122 \n\nprotect from hazardous substances, including PFOA, PFNA, PFDA and APFO, have been established by the \nCLP Regulation (No 1272/2008) that aligns the European system of classification and labelling rules to the \nGlobally Harmonised System (GHS). \n\nOther REACH restrictions on PFAS include the following. \n\n\u2022 In October 2017 the German and Swedish authorities proposed restricting the manufacture, \nmarketing and use of perfluorocarboxylic acids with 9\u201314 carbon atoms (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, \nPFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTeDA). This regulatory procedure is completed and the restriction will \nenter into force in February 2023. \n\n\u2022 A restriction proposal for PFHxS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, C6) was submitted by the \nNorwegian authorities in April 2019 and was discussed in ECHA\u2019s RAC and SEAC. The final \nRAC/SEAC Opinion was published in autumn 2020. \n\n\u2022 In December 2019, a German proposal to regulate PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid, C6) was \nsubmitted and was discussed in the ECHA committees. \n\n\u2022 ECHA has registered an intention to submit a restriction 1 October 2021 for the use PFAS in firefighting foams. \n\nThe POPs Regulation EC 850/2004 \n\nThe EU has implemented the POPs Regulation (EC 850/2004, recast under Regulation EC 2019/1021) which \nacts to implement the provisions of the Stockholm Convention across EEA Member States. \n\nPFOS was originally included in the restricted substances list of REACH. However, since its addition to the \nStockholm Convention in 2009, it has been regulated under the POPs Regulation. PFOS, its salts and \nperfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride (PFOSF) are listed under Annex I of the POPs Regulation, specifying the \nfollowing exemptions for unintentional trace contaminants (UTCs): \n\ni. substances or preparations (<10 mg/kg); \nii. semi-finished products or articles, or parts (<0.1 % by weight calculated with reference to the mass \n\nof structurally or micro-structurally distinct parts that contain PFOS or, for textiles or other coated \nmaterials, if the amount of PFOS is lower than 1 \u03bcg/m2 of the coated material). \n\nPFAS in sector-specific legislations \n\nEU Industrial Emissions Directive \nThe Industrial Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU) regulates pollutant emissions from large \nindustrial installations in the EU, including emissions of PFAS from sites where they are produced or used. \nIndustrial activities which exceed production thresholds listed in the IED\u2019s Annex I must obtain a permit \nfrom the competent authorities in the relevant Member State. Sector 4 of Annex I covers the chemical \nindustry (46), including the facilities that are currently producing fluorochemicals and fluorinated polymers. \nReleases of PFAS to the environment can also occur during the manufacture of products in which PFAS are \nused. Some of these activities are also listed in the IED\u2019s Annex I: for example, the production of textiles, \npulp, paper and cardboard. \n\nThe permits are based on the best available techniques (BATs) described in BAT Reference Documents \n(BREFs). The Commission adopts the BAT conclusions as Implementing Decisions and Member States use \nthem as a reference to define the permit conditions. In particular, the BAT associated emission levels (BAT\n \n46 The parts of Annex I Sector 4 that are relevant for PFAS are: \n4.1 Production of organic chemicals such as\u2026 \n\n(f) halogenic hydrocarbons,\u2026 \n(h) plastic materials (polymers, synthetic fibres and cellulose-based fibres), \u2026 \n(k) surface-active agents and surfactants. \n\n4.4 Production of plant protection products or of biocides. \n4.5. Production of pharmaceutical products including intermediates. \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010L0075\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 123 \n\nAELs) stated in BAT conclusions must not be exceeded when competent authorities set Emission Limits \nValues (ELVs) in permits. Annex II of the IED lists the polluting substances for which ELVs must be set in \nthe permits and it indirectly covers some PFAS (47). In addition, Article 14(1)a of the IED requires ELVs to \nbe set in permits \u201cfor other polluting substances, which are likely to be emitted from the installation \nconcerned in significant quantities, having regard to their nature and their potential to transfer pollution \nfrom one medium to another\u201d. \n\nWaste treatment facilities are covered by the IED and these can emit PFAS. The BAT conclusions for waste \ntreatment (48) address PFOA and PFOS, but not other PFAS. Permits are given to waste treatment plants \non condition that they implement the obligations within four years of the publication of a BAT conclusion. \nAuthorities can consider setting emissions limits for all other PFAS as well as for PFOS and PFOA. \n\nEU regulation on food-contact materials \nSeventeen categories of FCM exist and fluorinated polymers are relevant to at least food plastics, coatings, \npaper and board, waxes, inks and elastomers. Five of the 17 uses, including food plastics, have specific \nregulations. The 12 other materials are so-called non-harmonised materials. The EU Plastics Regulation on \nFood Contact Materials (EU 10/2011) is a positive list which covers monomers and polymer production \naids as well as migration from the final polymer article. This includes non-intentionally added substances \n(NIAS) at levels above the threshold of toxicological concern, which currently is set at 10 \u03bcg/kg food. These \nsubstances go through authorisation by the EFSA, based on hazard and risk criteria which are more than \n30 years old (Muncke et al. 2017). While CMR and persistent chemicals in general should be avoided in \nFCM, many are allowed due to old authorisations or if it can be shown to be likely, for example, by \nmigration modelling (Brandsch et al., 2015; Simoneau et al., 2011), that migration to food will not occur in \namounts of toxicological concern. Modelling can be applied if the assumptions are fulfilled, for instance, \nthat the substances in question are homogeneously distributed in the polymer, but in practice these \nassumptions may not be fulfilled. The FCM Regulation including the Framework Regulation (EC) No. \n1935/2004, the Good Manufacturing Practices Regulation (EC) No. 2023/2006, the Plastics Regulation (EU) \nNo. 10/2011 are currently being revised. Limit values related to either specific migration or total migration \nwill finally be set, or a limit of non-detectability is set \u2013 a default is currently defined as 10 \u00b5g/kg food. \n\nExamples of fluorinated polymers used in FCMs are metal coatings for non-stick pans, and baking and \nkitchen utensils used by consumers or in industrial food production. Fluorinated elastomers are typically \nused in tubing, membranes, baking trays and conveyor belts in industrial food production. Per- and \npolyfluorinated polyether polymers, according to the ECHA definition, are used in oil pumps and as \nlubricants in food production facilities. They, and fluorinated side-chain polymers, are also used as coatings \nand sizing agents in paper and board single-use food packaging and as food kitchen utensils such as bowls \n(Lohman et al., 2020; Dimzon et al., 2015; Trier et al., 2018; Trier et al. 2011, K\u00e4rrman et al., 2019). \n\nEU Regulation on cosmetics \nRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products lays out the rules that cosmetic products must comply \nwith if they are to be made available on the market. Annex II lists the substances that are prohibited for \nuse in cosmetics; PFOS and PFOA and their salts are prohibited, although they are found as impurities in \nsome products. All prohibited substances are included in Annex II of the Cosmetics Regulation: \nCosing_Annex II_v2 (49). \n\nDetergents \nDetergents are typically intentional mixtures of surfactants, consisting of a hydrophic (water repellent) tail \nand a hydrophilic (water soluble) polar head. These detergent mixtures are made up of so-called \nhomologue series which vary in the lengths of their hydrophobic tails. When the hydrophobic tail are \nchains of (monomer) repeat units, they qualify as polymers and are exempted from REACH (Krafft and \n\n \n47 Annex I includes PFAS identified as CMRs and PBTs. \n48 Commission Implementing Decision 2018/1147 of 10 August 2018. \n49 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/cosing/pdf/COSING_Annex%20II_v2.pdf \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 124 \n\nRiess, 2015). The Regulation on Detergents (EU 648/2004) and its amendments set requirements and \ndescribe methods to test detergents\u2019 ability to biodegrade initially (primary degradation) and ultimately \n(also called mineralisation). Since 2012, the Regulation also limits the content of phosphates, a nutrient \naffecting water systems, but the regulation neither assesses other impacts on human or environmental \nhealth, nor impacts along a detergent\u2019s lifecycle. \n\nFluorinated detergents/cleaning agents may be used as graffiti removers, and PFPEs have been used as \nspreading/wetting agents in floor detergents and waxes (Gl\u00fcge et al., 2020). \n\nEuropean-Pollutant Release and Transfer Register \nThe European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) (50) makes emission data reported by \nMember States on major industrial activities publicly accessible. It covers emissions from the activities \ndefined in Annex I of the E-PRTR Regulation (51), which largely equates to Annex I of the IED. Some of these \nactivities are sources of PFAS related to fluorinated polymers, for example, in the chemical industry, \nsurface treatment of metals, waste and waste water management, and the production of textiles and \nleather. \n\nEU Regulations on waste \nWaste are classified as hazardous or non-hazardous (52). The waste classification has several implications. \nThere are numerous EU Regulations setting special requirements for waste defined as hazardous, for \nexample, the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) requires permits for the export/import of hazardous \nwaste both within EU and between EU and OECD countries beyond the EU. Waste classified as hazardous \ncan only be disposed of in hazardous waste landfills meeting the acceptance criteria. Furthermore, the IED \nand the Environmental and Impact Assessment Directive concern the management of hazardous waste. \n\nF-gas Regulation \nThere is a specific regulation on fluorinated GHGs (EU) No 517/2014). Since the mid-1990s ODS have been \nsubstituted by certain F-gases, in particular HFCs. Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014 aims to reduce 2030 \nindustrial emissions by 70% compared to 1990. This reduction is to be realised by three means. \n\n1. The gradual phase-down of the quantities of HFCs used by means of quotas. The phase-down only \napplies to HFCs and not to perfluorocarbons (PFCs) or SF6. \n\n2. Prohibitions on use and placement on the market of F-gases, insofar as is technically feasible and \nmore climate-friendly alternatives are available. \n\n3. Continuation and expansion of the scope of regulations concerning leak tests, certification, \ndisposal and labelling. \n\nAnnex I Section I of the F-gas Regulation lists a number of HFCs, whereas Section 2 lists a number of PFCs \nthat may overlap with the current restriction proposal under development. \n\nSpecifically, HFC-23 is a known by-product from fluoropolymer production (HCFC-22), as also described in \nChapter 4. Twenty-seven fluorinated ethers and one perfluorinated polyether are also listed as GHGs \nwhich potentially could be used or formed during the lifecycle of fluorinated ether polymers, such as the \nPFPEs. \n\nChemicals Strategy for Sustainability \nTaking a forward-looking perspective, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability towards toxic-free \nenvironments under the European Green Deal pays special attention to PFAS, considering numerous cases \n\n \n50 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/industry/stationary/eper/legislation.htm \n    https://prtr.eea.europa.eu/#/home \n51 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1583400375088&uri=CELEX:32006R0166 \n52 Hazardous waste is a waste that due to its (intrinsic) chemical or other properties poses a risk to the environment and/or human \n\nhealth. The classification is primarily based on the European List of Waste (2014/955/EU) or on its hazardous properties. The \nEuropean Commission Regulations Nos. 1357/2014 and 2017/997 define the properties for hazardous waste classification \nreferring to assessment methods developed in CLP. \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=LEGISSUM:l32025\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 125 \n\nof environmental contamination (COM(2020) 667 final). Therefore, the strategy adopted a PFAS group \napproach under relevant legislation for water as well as banning them in fire-fighting foams and other nonessential uses. Further aims include enhanced policy dialogues and international forums, support for the \ndevelopment of innovative remediation methodologies and safe PFAS substitutes. \n\nGLOBAL LEGISLATION AND MAJOR LEGISLATION OUTSIDE EUROPE \n\nhis section covers the most relevant global-scale legislation on PFAS. \n\nStockholm Convention and Persistant Organic Pollutants Regulation \n\nThe Stockholm Convention on Persistant Organic Pollutants is an international treaty that aims to \neliminate or restrict the production and use of these substances in order to protect human health and the \nenvironment. \n\nThe POP Regulation (EC 2019/1021) transfers the resolutions of the Stockholm Convention into EU \nmeasures/law. \n\nCurrently, the most horizontal and widest legally-binding PFAS regulations of are in the Stockholm \nConvention. At global level, the Convention imposed restrictions (Annex B) on the use of PFOS (53), its salts \nand PFOSF in specific products (Decision SC-4/17) in 2009, and in 2019 included PFOA (54), its salts and \nrelated compounds for elimination from specific uses (IISD, 2019). After being placed on the POPs list in \n2009, there was an increase in the number of countries that put legal and administrative measures in place \nto control PFOS production, import, export and use. Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid(PFHxS), its salts and \nrelated compounds have been proposed for listing in the Annex A of the Convention without specific \nexemptions (Stockholm Convention, 2019). Potential toxicity of PFAS precursors has also been highlighted \nby the OECD (OECD, 2007). \n\nMontreal protocol \n\nThe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is the landmark multilateral \nenvironmental agreement transferred in Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 that regulates nearly 100 manmade chemicals referred to as ODS. The protocol regulates production, import, export, placing on the \nmarket, use, recovery, recycling, reclamation and destruction of ODS. Adopted on 15 September 1987, the \nProtocol is to date the only UN treaty that has been ratified by all UN Member States. \n\nPredominantly CFCs and HCFCs are covered by the Montreal Protocol, ranging from C1-C3 as core, partly \nor fully halogenated. HCFCs are gases used worldwide in refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam \napplications, but they are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. They are both ODS and powerful \nGHGs: the most commonly used HCFC is nearly 2,000 times more potent than CO2 in terms of its GWP. \n\nThe quantitative limits and allocating quotas for substances controlled under EC Regulation No 1005/2009 \nare updated yearly by means of a decision which lists the amounts, the addressees and the quota per \ngroup of companies. The latest ones are Decisions (EU) Nos. 2019/2079 and 2018/2029. A number of \nsubstances that are used as process agents are derogated from the restrictions. Thus, substances such as \nchlorofluorocarbon 113 (CFC113) and HCFC22, which are used as intermediates in the production of \nfluoropolymers, are not phased out. \n\n \n53  The Stockholm Convention covers PFOS, salts and PFOSF. In the EU POPs Regulation, the definition of the scope is \n\n\"Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives (PFOS) C8F17SO2X (X = OH, metal salt (O-M+), halide, amide, and other \nderivatives including polymers)\". \n\n54 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/784 of 8 April 2020 amending Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. \n\nhttps://www.unenvironment.org/ozonaction/what-we-do/refrigeration-and-air-conditioning\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 126 \n\nThe Montreal Protocol also makes important contributions to the realisation of the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. \n\nOverall, the Montreal Protocol phased out the use of ozone-depleting CFCs except for certain essential \nuses, and also defined the concept of essential use in Decision IV/25 (55). As a result, the Montreal \nProtocol's concept of essential use has been put forward as an approach for reducing exposure to PFAS by \nphasing out all non-essential uses. \n\nUnited States \n\nUntil very recently, PFAS have been largely unregulated at the federal level. Several US states have, \nhowever, set their own drinking-water guideline levels for PFOA and PFOS (56). The Interstate Technology \nand Regulatory Council (ITRC) indicated the significant variation in PFAS regulations by identifying the \nstates that have different guideline for PFOA and/or PFOS levels in drinking- and groundwater from US \nEPA\u2019s health advisories (HAs) (57). From 2006 to 2015, the US EPA worked with eight major chemical \nmanufacturers to voluntarily phase out production and use of so-called long-chain PFAS and their \nprecursors (PFOA Stewardship Program) (U.S. EPA 2020a). The eight companies participating in the PFOA \nStewardship Program met its goals (58; 59) At the federal level, the US EPA set a non-enforceable lifetime \nHA level for PFOA and PFOS, individually or combined, of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water in \n2016, (US EPA 2020b). This lifetime HA is based on the latest information on health effects for cancer and \nother diseases. The HA is not a legally enforceable federal standard and is subject to change as new \ninformation becomes available. That action was criticised for having no enforcement mechanism, for only \naddressing two compounds and for promulgating a maximum PFAS concentration that does not \nadequately protect human health. Some states have decided to set lower advisory levels while others have \nimplemented enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) at the state level for specific PFAS \nchemicals. \n\nIn 2019, US EPA released its National PFAS Action Plan to provide both short-term solutions and long-term \nstrategies to address this important issue. This Plan is designed to support the Safe Drinking Water Act \n(SDWA), which addresses PFAS in drinking water. In addition, the PFAS Action Act of 2019 requires the US \nEPA to establish destruction and disposal guidance for a range of materials, including landfill leachate, \nbiosolids, and \u201csolid, liquid, or gas waste streams\u201d from facilities that manufacture or use PFAS (60). The \nlegislation requires that, over a five-year period, the US EPA reviews all other PFAS chemicals and decides \nwhether to list them under Superfund. This is designed to investigate and clean-up sites contaminated \nwith hazardous substances (61). \n\nIn February 2020, the US EPA proposed regulating PFOA and PFOS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In \nJune 2020, a PFAS Significant New Use rule (SNUR) issued under Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) came \ninto force affecting the importation of PFAS. \n\n \n55 United Nations, Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Montreal, Canada, 1987 \n56  Abunada, Z., Alazaiza, M.Y. and Bashir, M.J. 2020. \u2018An Overview of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the \n\nEnvironment: Source, Fate, Risk and Regulations\u2019.

The \nidea behind the P-sufficient approach is that the persistence of PFAS is a sufficient basis to warrant \nregulation regardless of other hazard traits such as the chemicals\u2019 bioaccumulation potential or toxicity. \n\nCanada \n\nCanada has implemented a combination of regulatory and voluntary actions to reduce the risks from \ncertain PFAS. The Canadian Government has been involved in developing regulations and guidance for \ncertain PFAS since the early 2000s. Several federal departments are involved in different aspects of this \nwork. Significant PFAS work is carried out under the Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan (FCSAP) which \nis largely related to the PFAS resulting from aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) use. The FCSAP program \ndevelops guidelines and guidance to assess and manage federal PFAS-contaminated sites. \n\nThe Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) is another program with significant involvement in the assessment \nand management of certain PFAS. The CMP has an environmental monitoring and surveillance program \nfor air, water, sediment and biota that provides data on certain PFAS to support risk assessment and risk \nmanagement tools. \n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Health Canada (HC) are jointly responsible for \nassessing chemical substances in Canada to determine their risks to the environment and human health, \nand develop risk management instruments to address the identified risks, including through regulation. \nHealth Canada recently published maximum acceptable concentrations (MACs) for PFOS (63) and PFOA (64) \nas well as drinking water screening values (DWSV) for other PFAS. \n\nIn 2006, Canada launched their Action Plan for the Assessment and Management of Perfluorinated \nCarboxylic Acids and their Precursors. For their regulatory approaches, Canada has prohibited the \nmanufacture, importation, use, sale, and offer for sale (65) of four fluorotelomer-based substances and \nPFOS with some exemptions. \n\nIn 2008, the Government of Canada published regulations for PFOS and its salts that prohibit the \nmanufacture, importation, sale, offer for sale and use of PFOS or products containing PFOS. At the time, \nthere were some exemptions for their continued use by selected sectors at reduced concentrations.

These regulations are under review with the objective of removing or further limiting \nexemptions for specific uses. \n\nIn 2018, the Canadian Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water and the FederalProvincial-Territorial Committee on Health and the Environment released a technical guideline document, \nwhich reviewed and assessed all identified health risks associated with PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. \nIt incorporated available studies and approaches and took into consideration the availability of appropriate \ntreatment technology. Based on the review, the drinking water guideline for PFOS and PFOA was set at a \nMAC of 0.6 \u00b5g/l (600 ppt) and 0.2 \u00b5g/l (200 ppt) based on the general population. \n\nIn June 2019 Transport Canada allowed airports to use PFAS-free firefighting foam, which shows a more \nprecautionary approach as it targets the whole class of PFAS. \n\nCanadian federal guidelines or screening values to protect human health are now available for 11 PFAS, \nwhile values to protect ecological receptors are available for PFOS. \n\nAustralia \n\nPFAS are not manufactured in Australia. The country\u2019s approach to risk reduction is a combination of \nregulatory, policy and voluntary approaches focused on reducing the importation and use of some PFAS, \nsuch as long-chain non-polymer PFAS, and on preventing and responding to PFAS contamination \nconsistently, using best practice. \n\nThe PFAS National Environmental Management Plan (NEMP), January 2020, from the National Chemicals \nWorking Group of the Heads of EPAs Australia and New Zealand (HEPA) and Australia\u2019s Department of the \nEnvironment and Energy (DoEE), provides nationally agreed guidance on the management of PFAS \ncontamination in the environment. The NEMP is an appendix to the Intergovernmental Agreement on a \nNational Framework Responding to PFAS Contamination and is designed to achieve a clear, effective \ncoherent and nationally consistent approach to the environmental regulation of PFAS. \n\nThe NEMP reflects the current state of knowledge and is updated regularly to provide an evidence-based \napproach that will be adapted to reflect increasing scientific knowledge relevant to environmental \nregulation of PFAS. The plan mainly provides guidance about PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and their direct and \nindirect precursors, as these are the most widely studied and recognise them as primary indicators of a \nbroad range of PFAS, including short-chain and other long-chain PFCA and PFSA. \n\nAustralia will continue to participate in the Stockholm Convention\u2019s processes and to address any domestic \nimplementation requirements that may result if PFHxS or other PFAS are listed.

In countries such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, PFAS are essentially unregulated \nand not monitored. Japan has taken measures to regulate PFOA, PFHxA, PFHxS and PFOS in manufacturing \nwith no maximum levels for any PFAS set for drinking water water in the country. Additionally, PFOS and \nits salts are listed in Class I Specified Chemical Substances under the Chemical Substances Control Law \n(CSCL). \n\nIn 2008, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in China released Substances listed under the \nHigh Pollution, High Environmental risk Product Catalogue, which includes high temperature melting \nmembrane fluorine resin coating used on non-stick cookware, kitchenware and food processing \nmachinery, based on the potential residual PFOA in the products to establish financial and environmental \nprotection priorities. \n\nIn 2011, the National Development and Reform Commission in China issued an Industrial Reconstructing \nGuide Directory Restriction on the production of PFOS and PFOA and support for research and \ndevelopment on alternatives to these substances. In 2014, the MEP issued Announcement No.[2014]21, \nbanning production, transportation, application, imports and exports of PFOS, its salts and PFOSF, except \nfor specific exemptions and acceptable uses. \n\nSince 2013, South Korea addressed PFOS, its salts and PFOSF as restricted substances under the Persistent \nOrganic Pollutants Control Act. Under the Act, any manufacture, import, export and use of PFOS, its salts \nand PFOSF are restricted except for specific exemptions and acceptable uses defined in the Stockholm \nConvention. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2021/9 130 \n\nAnnex 4.

New and legacy chemicals continue to be released into Europe\u2019s environment, adding to the total chemical burden on Europe\u2019s citizens and ecosystems. Early identification of emerging risks is one of the activities of the European Environment Agency (EEA). This briefing summarises the known and potential risks to human health and the environment in Europe posed by a group of very persistent chemicals, the per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS).\nPFAS are a group of more than 4 700 man-made chemicals (OECD, 2018), the two most well-known of which are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (Box 1). PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique chemical and physical properties, including oil and water repellence, temperature and chemical resistance, and surfactant properties. PFAS have been used in firefighting foams, non-stick metal coatings for frying pans, paper food packaging, creams and cosmetics, textiles for furniture and outdoor clothing, paints and photography, chrome plating, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Very limited information is available regarding which specific PFAS are used in which applications and at what levels in Europe.\nPFAS are a group of organic chemicals that contain a stable (unreactive) fluoro-carbon segment. Polyfluorinated PFAS contain both fluoro-carbon and hydro-carbon segments where the non-fluorinated part can degrade and ultimately form perfluorinated PFAS acids, such as PFOA and PFOS. While the long-chain PFAS accumulate in humans, animals and sediment/soil, the short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment (German EPA, 2017, 2018) due to their persistency and high mobility in air and water. The OECD provides further information on groups of PFAS.\nPFAS either are, or degrade to, persistent chemicals that accumulate in humans, animals and the environment. This adds to the total burden of chemicals to which people are exposed (Evans et al., 2016) and increases the risk of health impacts. Of the relatively few well-studied PFAS, most are considered moderately to highly toxic, particularly for children\u2019s development. Figure 1 summarises current knowledge of the health impacts of PFAS.\nSources: US National Toxicology Program, (2016); C8 Health Project Reports, (2012); WHO IARC, (2017); Barry et al., (2013); Fenton et al., (2009); and White et al., (2011).\nPeople most at risk of adverse health impacts are those exposed to high levels of PFAS, and vulnerable population groups such as children and the elderly. Fewer studies have investigated effects on biota (Land et al., 2018). Throughout life, people and animals accumulate PFAS in their bodies. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated the multiple lines of evidence of PFOA and PFOS toxicities, which resulted in significantly lower provisional \u2018safe\u2019 limits, known as the \u2018tolerable weekly intake\u2019 (TWI) (EFSA, 2018). The assessment concluded that a considerable proportion of the European population is expected to exceed the TWI due to intake of PFAS from food and drinking water.\nCosts to society arising from PFAS exposure are high, with the annual health-related costs estimated to be EUR 52-84 billion across Europe in a recent study (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019). The study notes that these costs are likely underestimated, as only a limited range of health effects (high cholesterol, decreased immune system and cancer) linked to exposure to a few specific PFAS were included in the estimates. In addition, PFAS pollution also affects ecosystems and generates costs through the need for remediation of polluted soil and water. Such costs are currently difficult to assess since information on the number and scale of sites contaminated with PFAS in Europe and on how PFAS impact ecosystems is lacking.\nPFAS are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and organisms (Valsecchi et al., 2013) across Europe, and have been detected in air, soil, plants and biota (Houde et al., 2006). Areas around industrial production, manufacturing and application sites have been found to be particularly contaminated by PFAS. This has led to contaminated drinking water around factories in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, and around airports and military bases in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom (IPEN, 2018; Hu et al., 2016). The total number of sites potentially emitting PFAS is estimated to be in the order of 100 000 in Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019).\nGenerally, regulated PFAS have been substituted with other short-chain and polymeric PFAS. Regrettably, several of these \u2018novel\u2019 PFAS and their short chain degradation products are also persistent. In particular, short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment and have been found to contaminate surface, ground- and drinking water (Eschauzier et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016; Gebbink et al., 2017), and accumulate in plants (Ghisi et al., 2019), which may lead to increases in human dietary exposure.\nNovel PFAS are increasingly detected (Xiao, 2017) in European surface waters. PFAS water pollution has been identified in countries across Europe, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as outside the EU. Several PFAS are sufficiently volatile to be considered long-range transboundary air pollutants, implying that emissions outside Europe are transported into Europe where they may accumulate in cold areas such as the Arctic (EEA, 2017). The well-known and regularly monitored PFAS (mainly perfluorinated acids) account only for a fraction of the chemical burden from PFAS present in human blood, the environment and wildlife (Koch et al., 2019).\nWhile both well-known and novel PFAS have been detected in drinking water in non-EU countries (Xiao, 2017; Kabor\u00e9 et al., 2018; Dauchy, 2019), at present there is little monitoring data available in the EU for drinking water. A case study by the World Health Organization (WHO) documents the story of PFAS contamination of the drinking water of 21 municipalities in the Veneto region of Italy. Industrial activity in the area had polluted both surface waters and ground water, as well as the drinking water of approximately 127 000 citizens (WHO, 2017). Monitoring conducted by the authorities of the Veneto Region found PFOS in 63-100 % of the locations sampled and PFOA in 100 % of the sites.\nFor comparison, the European Commission proposed a limit value of 0.1 \u00b5g/L for each individual PFAS in the 2018 recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive. This draft limit value was exceeded by a factor of 130 for PFOS and 66 for PFOA in samples taken in the Veneto Region.\nPFOS and their derivatives are included as a priority hazardous substance under the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2013), with a much lower Environmental Quality Standard (AA-EQS) limit value of 0.65 ng/L (0.00065 \u00b5g/L) in inland surface waters and 0.13 ng/L in seawater. Member States are due to report on compliance with the PFOS EQS by 2021. Samples taken in 2013 in Northern Europe exceeded this EQS in 27 % of river sites and 94 % of Baltic Sea and Kattegat seawater (Nguyen et al., 2017).\nThe main exposure pathways for human and environmental exposures are shown in Figure 2. For the general population, PFAS sources include drinking water, food, consumer products and dust (EFSA, 2018). In food, fish species at the top of the food chain and shellfish are significant sources of PFAS exposure. Livestock raised on contaminated land can accumulate PFAS in their meat, milk and eggs (Ingelido et al., 2018; Numata et al., 2014). Direct exposure may also come via skin creams and cosmetics (Danish EPA, 2018; Schultes et al., 2018) or via air from sprays and dust from PFAS-coated textiles. There is little knowledge on uptake via skin and the lungs, which can be severely affected by PFAS (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 2010; S\u00f8rli et al., 2020). Consumer exposure may also occur via other routes such as via floor, wood, stone, and car polishing and cleaning products. Groups that may be exposed to high concentrations of PFAS include workers and people eating or drinking water and foods contaminated via PFAS treated food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019). Though PFAS are used in drugs and medical equipment, there is little information on exposure via these routes.\nPFAS are transferred in the womb from mother to child and unless exposure decreases with age, the PFAS body burden increases due to bioaccumulation (Koponen et al., 2018). Evidence of internal PFAS exposure in humans is available from several national human biomonitoring studies conducted inside and outside Europe. Men generally have higher PFAS body burdens and serum levels (Ingelido et al., 2018) because they excrete fewer PFAS. For the most regulated PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS, consistent declines have been observed over the past 10-20 years in Europe (e.g. in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden). This decrease in levels in humans is likely to result from reduced exposure as a result of regulatory and non-regulatory action on consumer products, such as food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019) and textiles (Greenpeace, 2017).\nDespite the decreases in long-chain PFAS levels in human blood, concentrations of PFOA and PFOS measured in human blood still exceed the EFSA benchmark dose levels (known as BMDL5). This is particularly true for children and highly exposed sections of the European population (Buekers et al., 2018). The BMDL5 reflect the concentration in blood at which critical effects occur (cholesterol effects for adults and immune-toxicity for children) and are the basis for the provisional TWIs for PFOA and PFOS (EFSA, 2018).\nThe above mentioned human biomonitoring study in the Veneto Region investigated human exposure to PFOA and PFOS in the period 2015-2016 among 257 Italian residents of contaminated areas and 250 residents of background areas (Ingelido et al., 2018). The PFOA blood concentrations of residents of contaminated areas were 9-64 times higher than those of the background population. For PFOS, the levels were 1.4-1.6 times higher. Levels of PFOA in the highly exposed population were 0.2 to 26 times greater than the EFSA BDML5, while for PFOS, the figure was 0.3-1.3 times. EU research projects, such as Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) (Box 2), are currently working to produce a representative picture of PFAS exposure for the European population, as well as investigating links between exposure and health effects.\nIt is difficult for citizens to totally avoid exposure to PFAS. Using PFAS-free personal care products and cooking materials and avoiding direct contact with PFAS-containing products helps to reduce exposure. Decreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS. General and specific guidance to consumers and business on how to find PFAS-free alternatives is provided by consumer organisations and some national institutions (see Danish EPA, German EPA and Swedish KEMI).\nDecreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS\n\u00a9 Engin_Akyurt / Pixabay\nMeasures to reduce PFAS pollution are in place, mainly addressing well-known PFAS substances and their precursors. PFOS and PFOA are listed under Annex A of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), implying that parties to the Convention should \u2018eliminate the production and use\u2019 of the chemicals.\nAt EU level, PFOS is restricted under the EU POPs Regulation (EU, 2019). PFOA and its precursors are currently restricted under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (EU, 2006), including their presence in products made or imported into the EU. This will soon be replaced by a new restriction under the POPs Regulation, which will have more limited derogations, following a decision taken at the Stockholm Convention.\nA number of other PFAS are on the REACH list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs). In June 2019, GenX (a short-chain PFAS substitute for PFOA in fluoropolymer production) was the first chemical added to the SVHC list on the basis of its persistent, mobile and toxic properties posing a threat to drinking water and the environment. Several PFAS are on the Community Rolling Action Plan for evaluation over the coming years. As mentioned above, PFOA and PFOS are priority hazardous substances under the Water Framework Directive (EC, 2017; EU, 2000).\nAcross Europe, several countries have been active in monitoring PFAS in environmental media as well as in humans and products. Some countries have set national limit values for water and soil (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), for textiles (Norway) and for food contact materials (Denmark). Several EU Member States have set drinking water limits for specific PFAS and for groups of PFAS (Dauchy, 2019). In June 2019, Denmark announced a ban on PFAS-treated food contact materials, to enter into force in 2020.\nWith more than 4 700 known PFAS, undertaking substance-by-substance risk assessments and comprehensive environmental monitoring to understand exposure would be an extremely lengthy and resource-intensive process. As a result, complementary and precautionary approaches to managing PFAS are being explored.\nThis includes the regulation of PFAS as a class, or as subgroups, based on toxicity or chemical similarities. The proposal to establish a new \u2018group limit\u2019 value for PFAS of 0.5 \u00b5g/L, in addition to limits for 16 individual PFAS of 0.1 \u00b5g/L in drinking water under the recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive is currently under consideration at EU level. Such measures can be supported by cost-effective and targeted monitoring of PFAS in the environment to provide early warning signals of pollution.\nIn June 2019, the European Council of Ministers (EC, 2019) highlighted the widespread occurrence of PFAS in the environment, products and people, and called for an action plan to eliminate all non-essential uses of PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019).\nThe move towards zero pollution requires that product life cycles are made safer from the start (Warner and Ludwig, 2016), based on the concept of safe-and-circular-by-design (van der Waals et al., 2019). This approach offers opportunities to protect the health of Europe\u2019s citizens and environment at the same time as driving innovation for safer chemicals.\nKissa, E., 2001, \u2018Fluorinated Surfactants and Repellents: Second Edition, Revised and Expanded Surfactant Science Series.

New and legacy chemicals continue to be released into Europe\u2019s environment, adding to the total chemical burden on Europe\u2019s citizens and ecosystems. Early identification of emerging risks is one of the activities of the European Environment Agency (EEA). This briefing summarises the known and potential risks to human health and the environment in Europe posed by a group of very persistent chemicals, the per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS).\nPFAS are a group of more than 4 700 man-made chemicals (OECD, 2018), the two most well-known of which are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (Box 1). PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique chemical and physical properties, including oil and water repellence, temperature and chemical resistance, and surfactant properties. PFAS have been used in firefighting foams, non-stick metal coatings for frying pans, paper food packaging, creams and cosmetics, textiles for furniture and outdoor clothing, paints and photography, chrome plating, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Very limited information is available regarding which specific PFAS are used in which applications and at what levels in Europe.\nPFAS are a group of organic chemicals that contain a stable (unreactive) fluoro-carbon segment. Polyfluorinated PFAS contain both fluoro-carbon and hydro-carbon segments where the non-fluorinated part can degrade and ultimately form perfluorinated PFAS acids, such as PFOA and PFOS. While the long-chain PFAS accumulate in humans, animals and sediment/soil, the short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment (German EPA, 2017, 2018) due to their persistency and high mobility in air and water. The OECD provides further information on groups of PFAS.\nPFAS either are, or degrade to, persistent chemicals that accumulate in humans, animals and the environment. This adds to the total burden of chemicals to which people are exposed (Evans et al., 2016) and increases the risk of health impacts. Of the relatively few well-studied PFAS, most are considered moderately to highly toxic, particularly for children\u2019s development. Figure 1 summarises current knowledge of the health impacts of PFAS.\nSources: US National Toxicology Program, (2016); C8 Health Project Reports, (2012); WHO IARC, (2017); Barry et al., (2013); Fenton et al., (2009); and White et al., (2011).\nPeople most at risk of adverse health impacts are those exposed to high levels of PFAS, and vulnerable population groups such as children and the elderly. Fewer studies have investigated effects on biota (Land et al., 2018). Throughout life, people and animals accumulate PFAS in their bodies. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated the multiple lines of evidence of PFOA and PFOS toxicities, which resulted in significantly lower provisional \u2018safe\u2019 limits, known as the \u2018tolerable weekly intake\u2019 (TWI) (EFSA, 2018). The assessment concluded that a considerable proportion of the European population is expected to exceed the TWI due to intake of PFAS from food and drinking water.\nCosts to society arising from PFAS exposure are high, with the annual health-related costs estimated to be EUR 52-84 billion across Europe in a recent study (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019). The study notes that these costs are likely underestimated, as only a limited range of health effects (high cholesterol, decreased immune system and cancer) linked to exposure to a few specific PFAS were included in the estimates. In addition, PFAS pollution also affects ecosystems and generates costs through the need for remediation of polluted soil and water. Such costs are currently difficult to assess since information on the number and scale of sites contaminated with PFAS in Europe and on how PFAS impact ecosystems is lacking.\nPFAS are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and organisms (Valsecchi et al., 2013) across Europe, and have been detected in air, soil, plants and biota (Houde et al., 2006). Areas around industrial production, manufacturing and application sites have been found to be particularly contaminated by PFAS. This has led to contaminated drinking water around factories in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, and around airports and military bases in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom (IPEN, 2018; Hu et al., 2016). The total number of sites potentially emitting PFAS is estimated to be in the order of 100 000 in Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019).\nGenerally, regulated PFAS have been substituted with other short-chain and polymeric PFAS. Regrettably, several of these \u2018novel\u2019 PFAS and their short chain degradation products are also persistent. In particular, short-chain PFAS accumulate in the environment and have been found to contaminate surface, ground- and drinking water (Eschauzier et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016; Gebbink et al., 2017), and accumulate in plants (Ghisi et al., 2019), which may lead to increases in human dietary exposure.\nNovel PFAS are increasingly detected (Xiao, 2017) in European surface waters. PFAS water pollution has been identified in countries across Europe, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as outside the EU. Several PFAS are sufficiently volatile to be considered long-range transboundary air pollutants, implying that emissions outside Europe are transported into Europe where they may accumulate in cold areas such as the Arctic (EEA, 2017). The well-known and regularly monitored PFAS (mainly perfluorinated acids) account only for a fraction of the chemical burden from PFAS present in human blood, the environment and wildlife (Koch et al., 2019).\nWhile both well-known and novel PFAS have been detected in drinking water in non-EU countries (Xiao, 2017; Kabor\u00e9 et al., 2018; Dauchy, 2019), at present there is little monitoring data available in the EU for drinking water. A case study by the World Health Organization (WHO) documents the story of PFAS contamination of the drinking water of 21 municipalities in the Veneto region of Italy. Industrial activity in the area had polluted both surface waters and ground water, as well as the drinking water of approximately 127 000 citizens (WHO, 2017). Monitoring conducted by the authorities of the Veneto Region found PFOS in 63-100 % of the locations sampled and PFOA in 100 % of the sites.\nFor comparison, the European Commission proposed a limit value of 0.1 \u00b5g/L for each individual PFAS in the 2018 recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive. This draft limit value was exceeded by a factor of 130 for PFOS and 66 for PFOA in samples taken in the Veneto Region.\nPFOS and their derivatives are included as a priority hazardous substance under the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2013), with a much lower Environmental Quality Standard (AA-EQS) limit value of 0.65 ng/L (0.00065 \u00b5g/L) in inland surface waters and 0.13 ng/L in seawater. Member States are due to report on compliance with the PFOS EQS by 2021. Samples taken in 2013 in Northern Europe exceeded this EQS in 27 % of river sites and 94 % of Baltic Sea and Kattegat seawater (Nguyen et al., 2017).\nThe main exposure pathways for human and environmental exposures are shown in Figure 2. For the general population, PFAS sources include drinking water, food, consumer products and dust (EFSA, 2018). In food, fish species at the top of the food chain and shellfish are significant sources of PFAS exposure. Livestock raised on contaminated land can accumulate PFAS in their meat, milk and eggs (Ingelido et al., 2018; Numata et al., 2014). Direct exposure may also come via skin creams and cosmetics (Danish EPA, 2018; Schultes et al., 2018) or via air from sprays and dust from PFAS-coated textiles. There is little knowledge on uptake via skin and the lungs, which can be severely affected by PFAS (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 2010; S\u00f8rli et al., 2020). Consumer exposure may also occur via other routes such as via floor, wood, stone, and car polishing and cleaning products. Groups that may be exposed to high concentrations of PFAS include workers and people eating or drinking water and foods contaminated via PFAS treated food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019). Though PFAS are used in drugs and medical equipment, there is little information on exposure via these routes.\nPFAS are transferred in the womb from mother to child and unless exposure decreases with age, the PFAS body burden increases due to bioaccumulation (Koponen et al., 2018). Evidence of internal PFAS exposure in humans is available from several national human biomonitoring studies conducted inside and outside Europe. Men generally have higher PFAS body burdens and serum levels (Ingelido et al., 2018) because they excrete fewer PFAS. For the most regulated PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS, consistent declines have been observed over the past 10-20 years in Europe (e.g. in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden). This decrease in levels in humans is likely to result from reduced exposure as a result of regulatory and non-regulatory action on consumer products, such as food contact materials (Susmann et al., 2019) and textiles (Greenpeace, 2017).\nDespite the decreases in long-chain PFAS levels in human blood, concentrations of PFOA and PFOS measured in human blood still exceed the EFSA benchmark dose levels (known as BMDL5). This is particularly true for children and highly exposed sections of the European population (Buekers et al., 2018). The BMDL5 reflect the concentration in blood at which critical effects occur (cholesterol effects for adults and immune-toxicity for children) and are the basis for the provisional TWIs for PFOA and PFOS (EFSA, 2018).\nThe above mentioned human biomonitoring study in the Veneto Region investigated human exposure to PFOA and PFOS in the period 2015-2016 among 257 Italian residents of contaminated areas and 250 residents of background areas (Ingelido et al., 2018). The PFOA blood concentrations of residents of contaminated areas were 9-64 times higher than those of the background population. For PFOS, the levels were 1.4-1.6 times higher. Levels of PFOA in the highly exposed population were 0.2 to 26 times greater than the EFSA BDML5, while for PFOS, the figure was 0.3-1.3 times. EU research projects, such as Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) (Box 2), are currently working to produce a representative picture of PFAS exposure for the European population, as well as investigating links between exposure and health effects.\nIt is difficult for citizens to totally avoid exposure to PFAS. Using PFAS-free personal care products and cooking materials and avoiding direct contact with PFAS-containing products helps to reduce exposure. Decreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS. General and specific guidance to consumers and business on how to find PFAS-free alternatives is provided by consumer organisations and some national institutions (see Danish EPA, German EPA and Swedish KEMI).\nDecreased exposure to PFAS may be achieved by using consumer products from green labels and buying brands free from PFAS\n\u00a9 Engin_Akyurt / Pixabay\nMeasures to reduce PFAS pollution are in place, mainly addressing well-known PFAS substances and their precursors. PFOS and PFOA are listed under Annex A of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), implying that parties to the Convention should \u2018eliminate the production and use\u2019 of the chemicals.\nAt EU level, PFOS is restricted under the EU POPs Regulation (EU, 2019). PFOA and its precursors are currently restricted under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (EU, 2006), including their presence in products made or imported into the EU. This will soon be replaced by a new restriction under the POPs Regulation, which will have more limited derogations, following a decision taken at the Stockholm Convention.\nA number of other PFAS are on the REACH list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs). In June 2019, GenX (a short-chain PFAS substitute for PFOA in fluoropolymer production) was the first chemical added to the SVHC list on the basis of its persistent, mobile and toxic properties posing a threat to drinking water and the environment. Several PFAS are on the Community Rolling Action Plan for evaluation over the coming years. As mentioned above, PFOA and PFOS are priority hazardous substances under the Water Framework Directive (EC, 2017; EU, 2000).\nAcross Europe, several countries have been active in monitoring PFAS in environmental media as well as in humans and products. Some countries have set national limit values for water and soil (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), for textiles (Norway) and for food contact materials (Denmark). Several EU Member States have set drinking water limits for specific PFAS and for groups of PFAS (Dauchy, 2019). In June 2019, Denmark announced a ban on PFAS-treated food contact materials, to enter into force in 2020.\nWith more than 4 700 known PFAS, undertaking substance-by-substance risk assessments and comprehensive environmental monitoring to understand exposure would be an extremely lengthy and resource-intensive process. As a result, complementary and precautionary approaches to managing PFAS are being explored.\nThis includes the regulation of PFAS as a class, or as subgroups, based on toxicity or chemical similarities. The proposal to establish a new \u2018group limit\u2019 value for PFAS of 0.5 \u00b5g/L, in addition to limits for 16 individual PFAS of 0.1 \u00b5g/L in drinking water under the recast of the EU Drinking Water Directive is currently under consideration at EU level. Such measures can be supported by cost-effective and targeted monitoring of PFAS in the environment to provide early warning signals of pollution.\nIn June 2019, the European Council of Ministers (EC, 2019) highlighted the widespread occurrence of PFAS in the environment, products and people, and called for an action plan to eliminate all non-essential uses of PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019).\nThe move towards zero pollution requires that product life cycles are made safer from the start (Warner and Ludwig, 2016), based on the concept of safe-and-circular-by-design (van der Waals et al., 2019). This approach offers opportunities to protect the health of Europe\u2019s citizens and environment at the same time as driving innovation for safer chemicals.\nKissa, E., 2001, \u2018Fluorinated Surfactants and Repellents: Second Edition, Revised and Expanded Surfactant Science Series.

A briefing by the European Environment Agency, published today, presents an overview of these chemicals, which continue to accumulate in people and the environment.\nThe EEA briefing \u2018Emerging chemical risks in Europe \u2014 PFAS\u2019 presents an overview of the known and potential risks to human health and the environment in Europe posed by per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). These extremely persistent and man-made chemicals are used in a variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique properties, for example, to increase oil and water repellence, reduce surface tension, or resist high temperatures and chemicals. Currently more than 4 700 different PFAS exist, which, due to their extreme persistence, accumulate in people and the environment.\nAlthough there is a lack of systematic mapping and monitoring of potentially polluted sites in Europe, national monitoring activities have detected PFAS in the environment across Europe, and the production and use of PFAS have also resulted in the contamination of drinking water supplies in several European countries. Human biomonitoring has also detected a range of PFAS in the blood of European citizens.\nThe EEA briefing warns that, due to the large number of PFAS, it is a difficult and time-consuming task to assess and manage risks for these substances individually, which may lead to widespread and irreversible pollution. The costs to society due to harm to human health and remediation in Europe have been estimated to be tens of billions of EUR annually. People are mainly exposed to PFAS through drinking water, food and food packaging, dust, creams and cosmetics, PFAS-coated textiles or other consumer products. Taking precautionary actions to limit non-essential uses and promoting the use of chemicals that are \u2018safe-and-circular-by-design\u2019 could help limit future pollution, the briefing notes.\nThe European Commission published yesterday its communication on the European Green Deal, which includes a zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment. The Commission\u2019s communication foresees a chemicals strategy for sustainability that \u201cwill both help to protect citizens and the environment better against hazardous chemicals and encourage innovation for the development of safe and sustainable alternatives.\u201d The communication also states that \u201cthe regulatory framework will need to rapidly reflect scientific evidence on the risk posed by endocrine disruptors, hazardous chemicals in products including imports, combination effects of different chemicals and very persistent chemicals.\u201d\n2019\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/pfas-pollution-is-widespread-in or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 01:35 PM\nFiled under: environment and health chemicals chemical pollution pfas\nFiled under: environment and health, chemicals, chemical pollution, pfas\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Synthetic chemicals are all around us. Some of them, however, can also be very harmful to our health and the environment. How can we limit the negative effects of chemicals that have become a part of our current way of life?\nEvery day, we are surrounded by hundreds or thousands of synthetic chemicals. They are in our food, clothes, tools, furniture, toys, cosmetics and medicines. Our society would not be the same without these substances. However, despite their usefulness, we know many of these substances can have negative impacts on our health and the environment.\nAccording to some estimates, about 6 % of the world\u2019s disease burden \u2014 including chronic diseases, cancers, neurological and developmental disorders \u2014 and 8 % of deaths can be attributed to chemicals. Moreover, these numbers could be growing and they take into consideration only a small number of chemicals whose effect on health is well established.\nMore than 300 million tonnes of chemicals were consumed in the EU in 2018 and more than two thirds of this amount were chemicals that are classified as hazardous to health, according to Eurostat. Over 20 000 individual chemicals have been registered in the EU under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation.\nAs these numbers keep growing, it is increasingly difficult to assess all the effects that chemicals have on our health and the environment case by case. Most studies so far have investigated the effects of only single chemicals and their safe thresholds but people are constantly exposed to a mixture of chemicals. This combined exposure can lead to health effects, even if single substances in the mixture do not exceed safe levels.\nMoreover, persistent chemicals can accumulate in human tissues, causing negative health effects after long\u2011term exposure. For example,are a group of almost 5 000 widely used chemicals that can accumulate over time in humans and in the environment. They are an example of persistent organic pollutants \u2014 the so-called forever chemicals.\nPeople are mainly exposed to PFAS through drinking water, food and food packaging, dust, cosmetics, PFAS-coated textiles and other consumer products. The effects of human exposure to PFAS include kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, liver damage and a series of developmental effects affecting fetuses.\nUsing PFAS-free products and cooking materials helps to reduce exposure. General and specific guidance on how to find PFAS-free alternatives is often provided by consumer organisations and national institutions working on the environment, health or chemicals.\nThe \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 could be translated into everyday words as \u2018better safe than sorry\u2019. It means that, when scientific evidence about something is uncertain, and there are reasonable grounds for concern about harm, decision-makers should err on the side of caution and avoid risks. With chemicals, the development of new substances outpaces research on their negative impacts. This is why it is important to proceed with caution.\nRead more about the precautionary principle:\nCommunication from the Commission on the precautionary principle.\nEEA\u2019s.\nPer- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of extremely persistent chemicals that are used in many consumer products. PFAS are used in products because they can, for example, increase oil and water repellence or resist high temperatures. Currently, there are more than 4 700 different PFAS that accumulate in people and the environment.\nSources: US National Toxicology Program (2016); C8 Health Project Reports (2012); WHO IARC (2017); Barry et al. (2013); Fenton et al. (2009); and White et al. (2011) apud Emerging chemical risks in Europe \u2014 \u2018PFAS\u2019; EEA Infographic.\nSome chemicals interfere with the functioning of the body\u2019s hormone system. Exposure to these so-called endocrine disruptors can cause a wide variety of health problems, ranging from developmental disorders, obesity and diabetes to infertility in men and mortality associated with reduced testosterone levels. Fetuses, small children and teenagers are especially vulnerable to.\nApproximately 800 substances are known or suspected to be endocrine disruptors and many of them are present in everyday products, such as metal food cans,\nplastics, pesticides, food and cosmetics.\nEndocrine disruptors include bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and certain types of phthalates. Phthalates, for example, are used to soften plastic for use in a wide range of consumer goods, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, air fresheners, lubricating oils, food packaging, clothing, personal care products and toys.\nConsuming food and drinks from containers that include phthalates is one way to become exposed. Inhaling indoor dust contaminated with phthalates that are released from plastic products or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) furnishings is another. (This is one of the reasons why airing our rooms regularly is important.) Children playing with toys that contain these substances are also at risk and, since phthalates can also be found in consumer products, such as soaps and suntan lotions, exposure can also occur through the skin.\nThe EU has put in place measures to reduce people\u2019s exposure to phthalates by banning the use of some of these substances and restricting the use of others in toys, cosmetics and food containers. However, older products and furnishings may contain phthalates that are now banned, so they are still present in our everyday environment.\nChemicals found to be dangerous have sometimes been replaced by other substances, with a similar structure, only later proven to be just as toxic. These cases are called \u2018regrettable substitutions\u2019, such as in the case of substituting bisphenol-A, a chemical formerly used in many plastic items and in thermal printing paper, with bisphenol-S and bisphenol-F.\nMoreover, a recent inspection project by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) showed that products imported from non\u2011EU countries can still contain phthalates. China has in recent years put in place restrictions on certain phthalates in toys and food contact materials but restricted phthalates are still found in many products imported to the EU from China and other, sometimes unknown, origins.\nConcerted efforts have reduced the presence of persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins, PCBs and atrazine, in Europe\u2019s environment since the 1970s, but their persistence and the fact that they accumulate in the food chain, notably in animal fat, continues to cause concerns. Another concern is that some substances have been substituted for other, equally toxic chemicals.\nPesticides are another group of chemicals that can harm our health, mostly as a result of the consumption of vegetables and fruit that have been in contact with them. Children are especially vulnerable, partly because they eat proportionally more food per kilogram of body weight than adults do. Eating organic produce can decrease this pesticide burden but not everyone can afford that.\nThe EU regulates pesticides under the Regulation on Plant Protection Products and sets safe limits for pesticide residues in food and feed. The latest information from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) shows that 95.5 % of food samples collected across the EU in 2018 were within legal limits. Table grapes and bell peppers were among the food products that most frequently exceeded the legal levels of residue. Still, based on the samples analysed, containing both regular and organic produce, the probability of European citizens being exposed to dangerous levels of pesticide residue is considered low.\nNot all chemical substances harmful to our health are new. For example, mercury is naturally present in the environment and has been released in air and water by human activity for centuries. However, today we know that ingesting mercury can affect the nervous system, kidneys and lungs, and exposure during pregnancy can affect the development of the fetus.\nPeople are exposed to mercury mainly through eating large predatory fish, such as tuna, shark, swordfish, pike, zander, eel and marlin. This also means that exposure can be limited by dietary choices, which is important especially for vulnerable groups, such as expectant mothers and young children.\nFor a more complete picture of human exposure to chemicals, there is a need for data on what is in our bodies. This includes chemicals that we eat as well as those that enter through other exposure pathways. These types of human biomonitoring data can be used to improve chemical risk assessments by providing information on actual human exposure through multiple exposure pathways.\nHuman biomonitoring measures people\u2019s exposure to chemicals by analysing the substances themselves, their metabolites or markers of subsequent health effects in urine, blood, hair or tissue. Information on human exposure can be linked to data on sources and epidemiological surveys, in order to inform research on the exposure\u2011response relationships in humans.\nThe European human biomonitoring initiative, HBM4EU, launched in 2017 and co\u2011funded under Horizon 2020, is a joint effort of 30 countries, the EEAand the European Commission.\nThe main aim of the initiative is to coordinate and advance human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU will provide better evidence of the actual exposure of citizens to chemicals and the possible health effects to support policymaking. The project has also set up focus groups to understand EU citizen\u2019s perspectives on chemical exposure and human biomonitoring.\nUnder HBM4EU, efforts are under way to generate robust and coherent data sets on the exposure of the European population to chemicals of concern. This includes producing exposure data on 16 substance groups, mixtures of chemicals and emerging chemicals, as well as exploring exposure pathways and linking exposure to health effects.\nVisit: www.hbm4eu.eu\nThe EU has the strictest and most advanced rules in the world when it comes to chemicals. The REACH Regulation is the key piece of legislation that aims to protect human health and the environment, and the EU has put in place rules for the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals.\nSynthetic chemicals released into nature can affect plants and animals. For example, neonicotinoids are a type of insecticide used in agriculture to control pests that pose risks to bees, as bees are important pollinators supporting food production. Pesticides can also affect fish and bird populations and entire food chains. In 2013, the European Commission severely restricted the use of plant protection products and treated seeds containing certain neonicotinoids to protect honeybees.\nThe EU has a body of legislation to regulate chemicals in detergents, biocides, plant protection products and pharmaceuticals. Policies limit the use of hazardous chemicals in personal care products, cosmetics, textiles, electronic equipment and food contact materials. Limits are also in place for chemicals in the air, food and drinking water. Legislation addresses point source emissions from industrial installations and from urban waste water treatment plants.\nStill, there is room for improvement to create a less toxic environment, and the European Green Deal aims to further protect citizens against dangerous chemicals with a new chemicals strategy and by moving the EU towards the zero pollution ambition.\nThere are many chemicals on the market and only a small fraction of these have been extensively studied for their risks. Designing safe products with a smaller number of different chemicals is one way of reducing potential risks.\nSource: EEA report - The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020: EEA Infographic.\nChemicals: www.eea.europa.eu/themes/human/chemicals\nSOER 2020, Chapter 10 on chemical pollution: www.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer-2020/chapter-10_soer2020-chemical-pollution/view\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2020/articles/living-healthily-in-a-chemical-world or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 10:49 PM\nFiled under: signals signals2020\nFiled under: signals, signals2020\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Many of the things \nthat we had taken for granted were suddenly not available to us anymore. The pandemic \ncaught the world by surprise, but, if you had asked a scientist working in a field related to \ninfectious diseases, this was only a matter of time.\n\nOne cannot help drawing parallels between \nthe pandemic, the climate crisis and the \nbiodiversity crisis. Scientists had warned \nus about a pandemic \u2014 there were rather \naccurate scenarios \u2014 but nobody knew \nexactly how it would unfold.\n\nWe cannot paint an exact picture of a world \nthat is two or four degrees warmer. We do \nnot know exactly what the tipping points will \nbe for entire ecosystems. What we do know is \nthat, unless we take decisive action and aim \nfor systemic transitions, the outlook is not \npositive and time is running out. A\u00a0pandemic \ncan, we hope, be controlled in a relatively \nshort period of time. It might prove to be \nmuch more difficult to reverse any damage \ncaused by reaching a tipping point in climate \nchange or in the degradation of nature.\n\nThe links between these fast- and \nslow-moving crises and pollution are \nclear. Cutting air pollution and reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions almost always \ngo hand in hand. Curbing water and soil \npollution would benefit nature. Reducing \nresource use and moving to a circular \neconomy would also reduce pollution.\n\nMany health authorities have warned that \ncitizens with certain pre-existing conditions \nmay be more vulnerable to COVID-19. \nThese pre-existing conditions include \nrespiratory illnesses, which are, in some \ncases, a consequence of, or exacerbated \nby, poor air quality.\n\nAs a result of the harsh lockdown \nmeasures, the concentrations of some \nkey air pollutants dropped dramatically \nin many European cities. These shocks \nwere not wanted \u2014 they are not a model \nfor a well-managed transition \u2014 but \nthey showed that air quality in cities can \nbe improved dramatically by reducing \ncar traffic and changing our current \nmobility\u00a0patterns.\n\nHuman beings and the institutions we have \nbuilt are wired to deal efficiently with clear \nand present danger. Unclear, invisible or \nslow-moving catastrophes are harder for \nus to comprehend and tackle. Pollution is \none such challenge.\n\f\n6\n\nIn most places in Europe, air does not look, \nfeel, smell or taste dirty. Yet, every year, \npoor air quality causes the premature death \nof nearly half a million Europeans. Tap water \nin Europe is generally safe to drink. We can \nenjoy fishing and swimming in many of our \nrivers, lakes and coastal areas. Yet, many \nof Europe\u2019s water bodies are not in good \ncondition. Europe\u2019s soils still suffer from \npollution that was released decades or \ncenturies ago.\n\nThe problems are clear but we should also \nremember that actions and policies to \ntackle pollution have made a difference. \nThe\u00a0number of Europeans dying \nprematurely as a result of poor air quality is \nless than half of early 1990s levels. Europe\u2019s \nindustry is becoming cleaner, with fewer \nemissions to air and water. Advanced waste \nwater treatment covers more and more \ncommunities. Our agricultural practices are \nslowly evolving.\n\nYet, we can and should do much more. This \nwill require the better implementation of \nexisting policies and also ambitious targets \nthat show a path towards climate neutrality, \nzero pollution, circular economy, healthy \nnature, and social justice in this fundamental \nsustainability transition.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the \nEuropean Commission, has set an ambitious \nagenda for her team\u2019s political priorities \nfor the next 5 years. The European Green \nDeal and its zero pollution ambition outline \nactions that reflect European citizens\u2019 \n\ndemand for addressing the climate and \nbiodiversity crises, while ensuring a just \ntransition where people are not left behind. \nThis is an agenda that could have a lasting \nlegacy in Europe.\n\nThe European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) \nwork has shown that our unsustainable \nsystems of production and consumption \u2014 \nespecially those related to food, mobility and \nenergy \u2014 are at the core of our sustainability \nchallenges, including pollution. These \nsystems are deeply integrated into our way \nof life and cannot be changed overnight but \nwe must move in the right direction and our \nambition needs to match our capabilities.\n\nFor the first time in modern history, we have \nthe means to aspire to generating heat and \nelectricity, moving around and growing food \nwithout harmful pollution. We no longer \nneed to accept pollution that affects people \nand the environment as an inevitable side \nproduct of progress.\n\nEurope has shown that we can make \nprogress with strong and binding legislation. \nWhen harmful technologies are banned, we \nfind better ways of doing things. Increasing \nknowledge and putting a steep enough price \ntag on pollution has proven to work. There \nare many policy instruments to choose from \nand, as long as the ambition is right, people \nwill find ways to move in the right direction.\n\f\n\u00a9 Perry Wunderlich, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nThe EEA has a lot of knowledge and \nexpertise to offer on pollution and other \nenvironmental challenges as well as \nsolutions for them.

Yet, this \nconviction of not repeating past mistakes \nand not allowing the same tragedies to \nunfold has also led to movements and \ninstitutions, including the European Union, \nthat have protected individuals and made \nour societies stronger.\n\nThe \u2018Next Generation EU\u2019 recovery package \naims to repair the economic and social \ndamage brought by the coronavirus \npandemic.

EEA Signals 2020 \nlooks at pollution through different lenses related to the Agency\u2019s work and EU legislation.\n\f\n10\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s zero pollution ambition\n\nThe zero-pollution ambition for Europe was announced in the European Green \nDeal, part of the European Commission\u2019s strategy to implement the United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals agenda. Its key aim is to protect citizens and \necosystems by better monitoring, reporting, preventing and remedying pollution. \n\nThe zero-pollution ambition can help the EU further decouple prosperity from harmful \nlevels of pollution, while enhancing EU resilience and strategic autonomy. This \ncan also support a sustainable post-COVID-19 recovery by, for instance: helping to \nmainstream the zero-pollution ambition in recovery efforts; promoting adequate and \ntimely information on the health and economic benefits of acting on pollution; and \nexploring further development of business practices that reduce pollution, create job \nopportunities and reduce social inequalities, as pollution disproportionately affects the \nmost vulnerable\u00a0people. \n\nAs part of the wider zero-pollution ambition, the European Commission has already \nannounced actions to reduce pollution in several Green Deal initiatives, in particular the \nCircular Economy Action Plan, the Biodiversity Strategy and the Farm to Fork Strategy. \n\nForeseen to be published in 2020 and 2021, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability \nand the Zero-Pollution Action Plan will help boost cleaner products and technologies \nacross all relevant economic sectors, prioritising pollution prevention over remediation. \nFollowing an open public consultation, the Zero-Pollution Action Plan is foreseen for the \nfirst half of\u00a02021.\n\nThe Zero-Pollution Action Plan will, amongst other priorities, focus on enhancing \nimplementation of existing and new legislation, revising key pollution control \ninstruments, addressing pollutants of emerging concern, and setting up an integrated \nzero-pollution monitoring and outlook framework. The European Environment Agency \nwill be a key partner in these activities.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/\f\n11\u00a9 Jose Luis Mendez Fernandez, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 11\n\f\n\u00a9 Plamen Hristov, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA12\n\f\n13\n\nImproving air quality \nimproves people\u2019s health \nand\u00a0productivity\nEurope\u2019s air quality has improved significantly over recent decades but pollutants still \nharm our health and the environment. Measures to limit pollution would improve \nour quality of life, save money in healthcare, boost workers\u2019 productivity and protect \nthe\u00a0environment.\n\nEurope\u2019s air is a lot cleaner than it was when \nthe European Union (EU) and its Member \nStates started introducing air quality and \npollution prevention and control policies \nabout half a century ago. European and \nnational policies and local actions have \nbeen able to curb pollution from transport, \nindustry and the energy sector.\n\nDespite this progress, the EEA\u2019s annual Air \nquality in Europe5 assessments consistently \nshow that air pollution still poses a danger \nto human health and the environment. Air \npollution levels in many of Europe\u2019s cities \nstill exceed both the EU\u2019s legal limits and \nthe World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) \nguidelines for the protection of human \nhealth. The tragic consequence of this \nis that, according to the EEA\u2019s estimates, \nevery year about 400\u00a0000 Europeans die \nprematurely because of poor air quality.\n\nAir pollution is the number one cause of \npremature deaths from environmental \nfactors in Europe but it also has \nconsiderable economic impacts. It \nincreases medical costs and reduces \neconomic productivity due to the ill health \nof workers. Air pollution also harms soil, \ncrops, forests, lakes and rivers. Pollutants \neven damage our houses, bridges and \nother built infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, the negative impacts of poor air \nquality are not equally distributed across \nsociety. A recent EEA report6 showed \nthat air pollution, as well as extreme \ntemperatures and noise, disproportionately \naffect Europe\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, \nespecially in Europe\u2019s eastern and \nsouthern regions. In addition to overall \nimprovements, targeted action is needed to \nbetter protect vulnerable\u00a0groups.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/air-quality-in-europe-2019\f\n14\n\nCOVID-19 and air pollution\n\nA decrease in many societal and economic activities during the pandemic led to a \ndecrease in emissions and subsequent levels of certain air pollutants. For example, \nthe use of vehicles declined during lockdowns and this led to lower nitrogen dioxide \nconcentrations in many cities across Europe7.\n\nExposure to air pollution is associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases \n\u2014 both health conditions known to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 and negatively \ninfluence prognosis. Some non-peer-reviewed articles have suggested links between air \npollution and high COVID-19 mortality rates, for example in Italy and the United States, \nbut further epidemiological research is required to clarify possible causal associations.\n\nFind out more: www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore8.\n\nDeeply rooted, systemic problems\n\nParticulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide \n(NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) are the \npollutants that cause the greatest harm \nto human health and the environment \nin Europe. The main sources of these \npollutants are road transport, domestic \nheating, agriculture and industry.\n\nIn cities, where about three out of four \nEuropeans live, road transport is often the \nmain source of air pollution, especially because \ncars emit pollutants at the ground level, close \nto people. In parts of Europe, domestic heating \nwith wood and coal is the most important \nsource of harmful pollutants. Unfortunately, \nthese emissions also increase during winter \nmonths when weather conditions often \nprevent pollutants from dispersing.\n\nWhat is common to the sources of \nair pollutants is that they are deeply \nrooted in our societies\u2019 core systems of \nmobility, energy and food production and \nconsumption. These same systems are not \n\nonly the main sources of air pollutants, but \nalso the root causes of the climate crisis and \nthe rapid loss of biodiversity.\n\nHow we move people and goods around, how \nwe generate heat and electricity, and how we \nproduce and consume our food are, in many \nways, the foundations of our current way \nof life. This is why changing these systems \nis not easy. In many cases, it requires us to \nreconsider the way we have built our societies \nand the way in which we live our lives.\n\nWin-win solutions for cleaner air\n\nThe EEA has worked together with a \nnumber of European cities in a pilot \nproject9 to better understand the \nchallenges to improving air quality at the \nlocal level. The 10 cities that participated \nin the pilot project have, for example, \nexpanded district heating, promoted \ncycling, lowered speed limits and issued \ncongestion charges to improve local air \nquality. Other successful initiatives include \nrelocating industrial facilities, modernising \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-and-covid19/air-quality-and-covid19\f\n\u00a9 Javier Arcenillas, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nhousehold stoves and boilers, using \ncleaner fuels for heating, switching to \ncleaner buses and trams, and introducing \nlow-emission transport zones.\n\nThese measures reduce local air pollution \nand often noise, and they improve \nresidents\u2019 quality of life. Moreover, the \nsame actions cut greenhouse gas emissions \nand, in many cases, save money. Still, \nthe same cities also reported important \nchallenges, especially in engaging with \ncitizens and making the political case for \nmeasures to improve air\u00a0quality.\n\nFor best results, local and regional actions \ngo along with effective national and \nEU policies that often offer substantial \nco-benefits in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions and air pollution at the same \ntime. These co-benefits can be achieved by, \nfor example, improving energy efficiency \nand greening the mobility\u00a0system.\n\nPeople demand clean air\n\nA recent report by the European Court of \nAuditors10 noted that citizens can play a \nkey role in pushing for better air quality. \nTo inform citizens, the EEA gives access to \nnear-real time data and statistics about \nair quality. The EEA and the European \nCommission have also built an online tool, \nthe European Air Quality Index11, which \nallows citizens across Europe to check \ncurrent air quality where they live, work or \ntravel. The index is calculated with hourly \ndata from more than 2\u00a0000 air quality \nmonitoring stations across Europe and \nalso provides health-related information \nand\u00a0recommendations.\n\n15\n\nhttps://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR18_23/SR_AIR_QUALITY_EN.pdf\f\n16\n\nPeople are increasingly interested in the \nquality of the air they breathe, with some \ncitizens taking steps to measure their local air \nquality themselves through citizen science12. \nThe EEA is working together with the European \nNetwork of the Heads of Environmental \nProtection Agencies (EPA Network) on a \nproject called CleanAir@School13, which \ninvolves having children, parents and \nteachers measure pollutant concentrations \naround\u00a0schools.\n\nThe schools that participate in the project \nmeasure nitrogen dioxide concentrations \nwith simple low-cost devices, placing one \nsampler beside the road in front of the \nschool and one in a less polluted area, such \nas the grounds behind the school. The \nproject aims to raise awareness of traffic \nas a source of air pollution and encourage \nparents to shift away from bringing their \nchildren to school by car.\n\nTowards zero air pollution\n\nLocal-, regional-, national- and EU-level \nactions and policies with binding targets \nhave improved air quality in Europe for the \nbenefit of its citizens and the environment. \nMore and more people across the world \nare demanding similar progress. Reducing \nthe number of deaths and illnesses from \n\nair pollution is one of the targets of the \nSustainable Development Goals that aim to \nensure healthy lives and promote well-being. \nA similar target is included for sustainable \ncities and communities. Like the other goals, \nachieving this would bring massive global \nbenefits, including increased productivity \nand reduced medical costs.\n\nThe actions that are necessary to cut air \npollution, both in Europe and globally, are \nlargely the same actions that are necessary \nto address the climate crisis and stop \nthe degradation of nature. We need to \nfundamentally change and decarbonise our \nsystems of production and consumption, \nespecially those related to mobility, energy \nand food.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Air pollution: www.eea.europa.eu/\nthemes/air\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 8 on air pollution: \nwww.eea.europa.eu/publications/\nsoer-2020/chapter-08_soer2020-airpollution/view\n\n\u2022 European Air Quality Index: www.eea.\neuropa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-index\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/assessing-air-quality-through-citizen-science\f\n4-8 %\n\n13-17 %\n\n12-34 %\n\n4-7 %\n\n15-20 %\n\n< 1 %\n\nWHO guidelinesEU limit/target values\n\nPM2.5\n\nPM10\n\nO3\n\nNO2\n\nBaP\n\nSO2\n\n74-78 %\n\n43-48 %\n\n96-99 %\n\n4-7 %\n\n75-90 %\n\n19-31 %\n\nShare of the EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above EU and\nWHO reference values in 2016-2018\n\nMain air pollutants and their effects on human health\n\nParticulate matter (PM) is emitted from many \nsources and is one of the most harmful pollutants to \nhuman health. It penetrates sensitive regions of the \nrespiratory system and can cause or aggravate \ncardiovascular and lung diseases as well as cancers.\n\nGround-level ozone (O3) is an air pollutant that affects \nhuman health, vegetation and materials. Ozone is \nformed when other pollutants react with sunlight.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) are \nemitted from fuel combustion, such as from power \nplants and other industrial facilities. They contribute to \nacidification and eutrophication of waters and soils. In \nthe air, they can cause health problems, such as airway \ninflammation and reduced lung function.\n\nOrganic pollutants, such as Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), \nare emitted from fuel and waste combustion, industrial \nprocesses and solvent use. Substances such as \nhexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \ncan have a range of harmful effects on human health \nand ecosystems.\n\nHeavy metals, such as lead and mercury, are toxic to \necosystems. They are mainly emitted from combustion \nprocesses and industrial activities. As well as polluting \nthe air, they can build up in soils and sediments, and \nbio-accumulate in food chains.\n\nAmmonia (NH3) is emitted mainly from agriculture and \ncontributes to both eutrophication and acidification of \nwaters and soils.\n\nAir quality problems in Europe\u2019s cities\nAlmost all Europeans who live in cities are exposed to air pollution that exceeds the levels set in the \nWorld Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) guidelines for clean air. Air pollution is the greatest environmental \nhealth hazard in Europe and globally.\n\nSource: EEA report - Healthy environment, healthy lives14.\n\n17\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/healthy-environment-healthy-lives\f\n\u00a9 Jacob Kaptein, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA18\n\f\n19\n\nEnsuring clean waters for \npeople and nature\nWater covers more than 70\u00a0% of the Earth\u2019s surface and is essential to all life on our \nplanet. Of all the Earth\u2019s water, 96.5\u00a0% is contained within the oceans as salt water, \nwhereas the remaining 3.5\u00a0% is freshwater \u2014 lakes, rivers, groundwater and ice. Good \nmanagement of this limited and precious resource is indispensable for the well-being of \npeople and nature.\n\nThroughout history, people have settled \nclose to rivers, lakes and coastlines. Rivers \nand streams brought clean water and took \naway waste. As human settlements grew, so \ndid their use of clean water and discharge \nof polluted water. From the 18th century \nonwards, Europe\u2019s water bodies also started \nreceiving pollutants from industry.\n\nWith sewage systems, waste water \ntreatment facilities and the regulation of \npollutants from industry and agriculture, \nEurope has come a long way in reducing \nemissions to water bodies. Nevertheless, \nwater pollution continues to be a problem, \nwith over-exploitation, physical alterations \nand climate change continuing to affect the \nquality and the availability of water.\n\nA mixed picture \u2014 the state of \nEurope\u2019s water bodies\n\nAbout 88\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s freshwater use \ncomes from rivers and groundwater. The \nrest comes from reservoirs (about 10\u00a0%) \nand lakes (less than 2\u00a0%). Like any other vital \nresource or living organism, water can come \nunder pressure. This can happen when \ndemand for water exceeds its supply or \nwhen pollution reduces its quality.\n\nWaste water treatment and reductions \nin nitrogen and phosphorus losses \nfrom agriculture have led to significant \nimprovements in water quality. However, \naccording to the EEA\u2019s most recent data15, \nonly 44\u00a0% of surface waters in Europe \nachieve good or high ecological status, \npartly because of pollution. The situation of \nEurope\u2019s groundwater is somewhat better. \nAbout 75\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s groundwater areas \nhas a \u2018good chemical status\u201916.\n\nMarine environment\nunder threat\n\nThe current condition of Europe\u2019s seas \n\u2014 from the Baltic to the Mediterranean \u2014 \nis\u00a0generally poor, according to the EEA\u2019s \nMarine messages II17 assessment. Despite \nsome positive developments achieved \nthrough regional cooperation, a range of \npressures from historic and current human \nactivities could cause irreversible damage to \nmarine ecosystems.\n\nMoreover, the EEA\u2019s report on \ncontaminants in Europe\u2019s seas18 showed \nthat all four regional seas in Europe have \na large-scale contamination problem, \nranging from 96\u00a0% of the assessed area \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/european-waters/water-quality-and-water-assessment/water-assessments/ecological-status-of-surface-water-bodies\f\n20 \u00a9 Alberto Cob, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nin the Baltic Sea and 91\u00a0% in the Black \nSea to 87\u00a0% in the Mediterranean Sea and \n75\u00a0% in the North\u2011East Atlantic Ocean. The \ncontamination problem is mainly caused \nby synthetic chemicals and heavy metals \noriginating from human activities both on \nland and at\u00a0sea.\n\nSimilarly, the EEA\u2019s report on nutrient \nenrichment and eutrophication in Europe\u2019s \nseas19 showed that eutrophication as a \nconsequence of nutrient losses, mainly \nfrom agriculture, is another large-scale \nproblem, especially in the Baltic Sea and the \nBlack Sea.\n\nCoastal and maritime activities, such as \nfishing, shipping, tourism, aquaculture and \nthe extraction of oil and gas, cause multiple \npressures on the marine environment, \nincluding pollution. Marine litter is present in \nall marine ecosystems, with plastics, metals, \ncardboard and other waste accumulating \non shorelines, the seabed and surface \nwaters. Ships and offshore activities also \ncause underwater noise pollution, which can \nnegatively affect marine life.\n\nTackling water pollution \u2014 waste \nwater and diffuse pollution\n\nMuch has been done across Europe to \nenable the collection and treatment of \nurban waste water. According to EEA data20, \nmost European countries were collecting \nand treating sewage at the tertiary level \nfrom most of their population by 2017. \nStill, in a number of European countries \nless than 80\u00a0% of the population was \nconnected to public urban waste water \ntreatment\u00a0systems.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/nutrient-enrichment-and-eutrophication-in\f\n21\n\nMeanwhile, existing infrastructure \nrequires maintenance and new pressures \nrequire substantial investments, including \nadapting to climate change, providing \nimproved waste water facilities and \ntackling new concerns, such as medicines \nor the so-called mobile chemicals in \nwaste\u00a0water.\n\nIn addition to point source pollution from \nindustry and waste water treatment plants, \nwater bodies also suffer from diffuse \npollution, for example from transport, \nagriculture, forestry and rural dwellings. \nPollutants that are first released to air and \nsoil often also end up in water bodies.\n\nIntensive agriculture\n\nIntensive agriculture relies on fertilisers to \nincrease crop yields. These fertilisers often \nwork by introducing nitrogen, phosphorus \n\nand other chemicals into the soil. Nitrogen is \na chemical element abundant in nature and \nis essential for plant growth.\n\nHowever, some of the nitrogen intended for \ncrops is not taken up by plants. The amount of \nfertiliser applied may be more than the plant \ncan absorb or it may not be applied during the \nplant\u2019s growing period. This excess nitrogen \nfinds its way into water bodies and there it \nboosts the growth of certain water plants and \nalgae in a process known as eutrophication. \nThis extra growth depletes the oxygen in the \nwater, rendering it uninhabitable for other \nanimal and plant species.\n\nPesticides used in agriculture aim to protect \ncrops from invasive pests, ensuring crop \ngrowth. However, these effects can occur \nbeyond the intended target, harming other \nspecies and reducing biodiversity. Often, \nthese chemicals end up in water bodies.\n\nCOVID-19 and water pollution\n\nLower economic activity during lockdowns is likely to lead to lower emissions to water \nfrom industry, while emissions from schools and workplaces are likely to shift towards \nhouseholds. There may be less water stress in specific areas in Europe, depending on \nthe impacts on agriculture and energy production. Reduced tourism is also likely to lead \nto lower emissions to water along European coasts and in other tourist destinations.\n\nFind out more: www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore21.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore/\f\n\u00a9 Erik Mclean, Unsplash\n\nPlastics in the water \u2014 \nsize\u00a0matters\n\nPlastics have become integral to almost \nevery aspect of our lives, and the issue of \nplastics entering our waterways, lakes and \nseas is dramatic and well documented.\n\nClearing visible plastic litter from rivers, \nbeaches and even the sea might still be \npossible but, with time and exposure to \nsunlight, plastic waste fragments into \never-smaller pieces, known as micro- and \nnanoplastics. Waste water treatment plants \ncan filter out most of these tiny particles \nbut the remaining sludge is often spread on \nland, with plastic particles sometimes being \nwashed into water bodies by rainfall. These \nsmallest particles are hardly visible to the \neye and their impacts on nature and our \nhealth are still poorly understood.\n\nMany plastics are also highly adsorbent, \nattracting other contaminants. As noted \nin the EEA report on the state of Europe\u2019s \nseas22, concentrations of contaminants in \npieces of microplastic can be thousands of \ntimes greater than in ambient seawater. This \nexposes marine life to harmful chemicals, \nwhich, in turn, can end up on our\u00a0plates.\n\nTowards zero water pollution\n\nIn the past decades, Europe has made \nsignificant efforts to improve water quality, \ntreat waste water and protect marine and \nfreshwater habitats and species. Today, \nEU policies address a wide range of issues \naffecting water, such as drinking water, \nurban waste water, bathing water quality, \nsingle-use plastics, industrial emissions \n\n22\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/state-of-europes-seas\f\n23\n\nand hazardous chemicals. Overarching \nprogrammes and legislation, such as the \nWater Framework Directive23 and the \nMarine Strategy Framework Directive24, \nstrengthen these specific pieces of \nEU\u00a0legislation.\n\nHowever, efforts to move towards zero \npollution will require a major focus on \nwater as part of the European Green \nDeal\u2019s zero pollution action plan, including \naiming to restore the natural functions \nof groundwater, surface water, marine \nand coastal waters, tackling pollution \nfrom urban runoff, and addressing new \nconcerns, such as microplastics and \nchemicals.\n\nAs one of the key components of the \nEuropean Green Deal, the farm to fork \nstrategy aims to significantly reduce \nthe agricultural use and risk of chemical \npesticides25, the use of antibiotics26 and \nfertiliser losses to the environment, \nfor example through integrated pest \nmanagement and an integrated nutrient \nmanagement action plan.

The presence of chemicals might be the answer. From heavy metals \nto organic pollutants and microplastics, the soil in which we grow our food and the \nland on which we build our homes might be contaminated with different pollutants. \nContaminants are widespread and are accumulating in Europe\u2019s land and soils. How can \nwe tackle this problem?\n\nThe ground below our feet is much more \nthan rocks, soil and silt. Every square metre \ncan be unique in terms of its composition, \nits structure and the life that it contains and \nsupports. Some contain more rocks rich in \ncertain minerals; others are rich in plant \nresidues with pockets of air and water.\n\nSoil is often a neglected domain of biodiversity \nbut even a small patch can teem with life, \nranging from tiny organisms to fungi and \nearthworms, all playing a vital role in the \nfunctioning of the soil ecosystem. It is also in \nthis space that nutrients are turned into forms \nthat plants can take up, allowing biomass to \nform and store carbon. It is also here that our \nprospective drinking water starts its natural \npurification journey towards groundwater.\n\nA local problem?\n\nThe way we use land often introduces \nadditional substances to these unique \necosystems in order to protect selected \ncrops or add nutrients. Pollutants released \nfrom industry, transport and other economic \nactivities can also travel long distances and \n\nreach soils, where they become diluted and \nare temporarily stored. Soil, a component \nof land, is considered polluted when \ncontaminants adversely affect human health \nor the environment.\n\nWith every step we take, we could be \nstanding on top of a very different mix \nand concentration of contaminants in the \nground. The large variation of contaminants, \nsoils, and climatic and land use conditions \nmakes it costly to monitor and assess the \nfull extent of land and soil pollution. What \nwe know is mostly based on field samples \nscattered across countries.\n\nMetals, fertilisers and pesticides\n\nWe need agriculture to grow our food but \nsome unsustainable farming practices \ncontinue to contaminate soils.\n\nPlants need, among other things, nutrients \nto grow and intensive agriculture can \ndeplete nutrients in the soil faster than \nnature replenishes them. Fertilisers work \nby compensating this deficit by introducing \n\nLand and soil pollution \n\u2014 widespread, harmful \nand\u00a0growing\n\f\n28\n\nextra nutrients. Unfortunately, the whole \namount is often not taken up by the plants \nand the surplus that is initially in soil, sooner \nor later, enters lakes and rivers. Once in \nwater, surplus nitrogen often leads to \nexcessive growth of plants and algae, the \ndecomposition of which can severely reduce \noxygen levels in water, harming animal and \nplant species in that ecosystem.\n\nCopper has been used extensively as a \nfungicide in vineyards and orchards for \ndecades. A recent large-scale study29 showed \nthat copper concentrations in vineyards \nwere three times higher than the average \nin European soils. Copper is also added \nto animal feed and is introduced to the \nenvironment when manure is spread over \ngrasslands and other agricultural lands.\n\nCadmium is another highly toxic metal \nfound in mineral phosphorus fertilisers. \nSome \u2018organic fertilisers\u2019, such as sewage \nsludges, manure, compost and bio-waste, \ncan also introduce a broad mix of heavy \nmetals and organic pollutants if they are not \nwell\u00a0regulated.\n\nChemicals from the long-term use of \npesticides are also found in soil samples \nfrom across Europe. Over 80\u00a0% of soils \ntested in one study30 contained pesticide \nresidues, with 58\u00a0% containing two or more \ntypes of residue. \n\nWaste management, industry and \nbeyond the borders\n\nAgricultural practices are far from being \nthe only source of land and soil pollution. \nPoorly managed waste \u2014 both municipal \n\nand industrial waste \u2014 is responsible for \nmore than one third of local contaminations, \nfollowed by industrial activities. Of the \nseveral millions of sites estimated to carry \nout potentially polluting activities in the EU, \ndetailed public information exists for only \na\u00a0fraction31.\n\nLand and soil pollution is also a global \nproblem. Air and water can transport \npollutants, including nitrogen compounds \nand tiny plastic fragments, across the \nglobe and deposit them on land surfaces. \nPollutants are found even on the highest \npeaks and the most remote beaches.\n\nForever they remain and \naccumulate\n\nSome pollutants break down in soil over \ntime but others remain forever. In many \ncases, land and its soils are the final \ndestination where various pollutants end \nup and accumulate over time. The full risks \nof these chemicals and various mixes of \nthem are not fully known. However, based \non sampled sites, we know that land and \nsoil pollution can have significant impacts \non human health as well as soil biodiversity \nand ecosystem health. These pollutants \ncan affect soil organisms and possibly \ncontaminate our food and drinking water.\n\nRemediating contaminated land is difficult \nand expensive, but necessary to clean up \npast pollution. However, local authorities \noften lack the means and tools to manage \nremediation. More than 65\u00a0000 sites have \nbeen remediated in the EU; however, by far, \nmost potentially contaminated sites are still \nleft untouched32.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/science-update/eu-topsoil-copper-concentration-highest-vineyards-olive-groves-and-orchards\f\n\u00a9 Terezie Pol\u00edvkov\u00e1, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nBest solution \u2014 prevention\n\nPrevention remains the most effective and \ncheapest way to ensure healthy soils \u2014 and \ncleaner water and air \u2014 in the long term. Any \ninitiative aimed at preventing and reducing \npollution \u2014 from product design, better \nrecycling, waste management, crop rotation, \nprecision farming and reduced pesticide and \nfertiliser use to cleaner transport and industry \n\u2014 and at supporting authorities to implement \neffective measures will contribute to alleviating \npressures on these vital ecosystems.\n\nMany existing and upcoming policy initiatives \nunder the European Green Deal \u2014 the \ncircular economy, the farm to fork strategy, \nthe biodiversity strategy, the chemicals \nstrategy, the new soil strategy and the zero \npollution action plan \u2014 provide a European \nframework and support national authorities \nand land users to protect land and soils \nfrom pollution.

Synthetic chemicals are all around us. Some \nof them, however, can also be very harmful to our health and the environment. How can \nwe limit the negative effects of chemicals that have become a part of our current way \nof\u00a0life?\n\nEvery day, we are surrounded by hundreds \nor thousands of synthetic chemicals. They \nare in our food, clothes, tools, furniture, toys, \ncosmetics and medicines. Our society would \nnot be the same without these substances. \nHowever, despite their usefulness, we know \nmany of these substances can have negative \nimpacts on our health and the environment.\n\nAccording to some estimates, about 6\u00a0% \nof the world\u2019s disease burden \u2014 including \nchronic diseases, cancers, neurological \nand developmental disorders \u2014 and 8\u00a0% \nof deaths can be attributed to chemicals. \nMoreover, these numbers could be growing \nand they take into consideration only a small \nnumber of chemicals whose effect on health \nis well established34.\n\nDangerous cocktails and \n\u2018forever\u00a0chemicals\u2019\n\nMore than 300 million tonnes of chemicals \nwere consumed in the EU in 2018 and \nmore than two thirds of this amount were \nchemicals that are classified as hazardous to \nhealth, according to Eurostat35. Over 20\u00a0000 \n\nindividual chemicals have been registered \nin the EU under the Registration, Evaluation, \nAuthorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \n(REACH) Regulation36.\n\nAs these numbers keep growing, it is \nincreasingly difficult to assess all the effects \nthat chemicals have on our health and the \nenvironment case by case. Most studies \nso far have investigated the effects of only \nsingle chemicals and their safe thresholds \nbut people are constantly exposed to \na mixture of chemicals. This combined \nexposure can lead to health effects, even \nif single substances in the mixture do not \nexceed safe levels.\n\nMoreover, persistent chemicals can \naccumulate in human tissues, causing \nnegative health effects after long-term \nexposure. For example, per- and \npolyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS)37 \nare a group of almost 5\u00a0000 widely used \nchemicals that can accumulate over time in \nhumans and in the environment. They are \nan example of persistent organic pollutants \n\u2014 the so-called forever chemicals.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/human/chemicals/emerging-chemical-risks-in-europe\f\n34\n\nPeople are mainly exposed to PFAS through \ndrinking water, food and food packaging, \ndust, cosmetics, PFAS-coated textiles and \nother consumer products. The effects of \nhuman exposure to PFAS include kidney \ncancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, \nliver damage and a series of developmental \neffects affecting fetuses.\n\nUsing PFAS-free products and cooking \nmaterials helps to reduce exposure. General \nand specific guidance on how to find \nPFAS-free alternatives is often provided \nby consumer organisations and national \ninstitutions working on the environment, \nhealth or chemicals.\n\nThe precautionary principle\n\nThe \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 could be translated into everyday words as \u2018better safe \nthan sorry\u2019. It means that, when scientific evidence about something is uncertain, and \nthere are reasonable grounds for concern about harm, decision-makers should err on \nthe side of caution and avoid risks. With chemicals, the development of new substances \noutpaces research on their negative impacts. This is why it is important to proceed \nwith\u00a0caution.\n\nRead more about the precautionary\u00a0principle:\n\u2022 Communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle38.\n\u2022 EEA\u2019s Late lessons from early warnings II39.\n\nEndocrine disruptors\n\nSome chemicals interfere with the \nfunctioning of the body\u2019s hormone \nsystem. Exposure to these so-called \nendocrine disruptors can cause a wide \nvariety of health problems, ranging from \ndevelopmental disorders, obesity and \ndiabetes to infertility in men and mortality \nassociated with reduced testosterone \nlevels. Fetuses, small children and \nteenagers are especially vulnerable to \nendocrine disruptors40.\n\nApproximately 800 substances are known \nor suspected to be endocrine disruptors \nand many of them are present in everyday \n\nproducts, such as metal food cans,  \nplastics, pesticides, food  \nand cosmetics.\n\nEndocrine disruptors include bisphenol A \n(BPA), dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs) and certain types of phthalates. \nPhthalates, for example, are used to soften \nplastic for use in a wide range of consumer \ngoods, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, \ndetergents, air fresheners, lubricating oils, \nfood packaging, clothing, personal care \nproducts and toys.\n\nhttps://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/21676661-a79f-4153-b984-aeb28f07c80a/language-en\f\nDevelopmental effects \naffecting the unborn child\n\nIncreased miscarriage risk\n(i.e. pregnancy loss)\n\nLower birth weight\n\nReduced response \nto vaccines\n\nLow sperm count and mobility\n\nEarly puberty onset\n\nDelayed mammary gland \ndevelopment\n\nObesity\n\nThyroid disease\n\nIncreased cholesterol levels\n\nBreast cancer\n\nInflammatory \nbowel disease\n\n(ulcerative colitis)\n\nKidney cancer\n\nIncreased time to pregnancy\n\nPregnancy induced \nhypertension/pre-eclampsia\n(increased blood pressure)\n\nLiver damage\n\nTesticular cancer\n\nHigh certainty\n\nLower certainty\n\n35\n\nEffects of PFAS on human health\nPer- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of extremely persistent chemicals that are \nused in many consumer products.

(This\u00a0is \none of the reasons why airing our rooms \nregularly is important.) Children playing with \ntoys that contain these substances are also \nat risk and, since phthalates can also be \nfound in consumer products, such as soaps \nand suntan lotions, exposure can also occur \nthrough the skin.\n\nThe EU has put in place measures to reduce \npeople\u2019s exposure to phthalates by banning \nthe use of some of these substances \nand restricting the use of others in toys, \ncosmetics and food containers. However, \nolder products and furnishings may contain \nphthalates that are now banned, so they are \nstill present in our everyday environment.\n\nMoreover, a recent inspection project \nby the European Chemicals Agency \n(ECHA)42 showed that products imported \nfrom non-EU countries can still contain \nphthalates. China has in recent years put \nin place restrictions on certain phthalates \nin toys and food contact materials but \nrestricted phthalates are still found in many \nproducts imported to the EU from China \nand other, sometimes unknown,\u00a0origins.\n\nConcerted efforts have reduced the \npresence of persistent organic pollutants, \nsuch as dioxins, PCBs and atrazine, in \nEurope\u2019s environment since the 1970s, but \ntheir persistence and the fact that they \naccumulate in the food chain, notably in \nanimal fat, continues to cause concerns43. \nAnother concern is that some substances \nhave been substituted for other, equally \ntoxic chemicals.\n\nRegrettable substitutions\n\nChemicals found to be dangerous have \nsometimes been replaced by other \nsubstances, with a similar structure, \nonly later proven to be just as toxic. \nThese cases are called \u2018regrettable \nsubstitutions\u2019, such as in the case of \nsubstituting bisphenol-A, a chemical \nformerly used in many plastic items \nand in thermal printing paper, with \nbisphenol-S and bisphenol-F44.\n\nhttps://echa.europa.eu/-/inspectors-find-phthalates-in-toys-and-asbestos-in-second-hand-products\f\n~ 500 chemicals\nextensively characterised for \ntheir hazards and exposures\n\n~ 100 000 chemicals\non the market\n\n~ 22 600 chemicals\nwith a use over \n1 tonne per year\n\n~ 4 700 chemicals\nwith a use over\n\n100 tonnes per year\nprioritised in \n\nhazard characterisation\nand evaluation\n\n~ 10 000 chemicals \nfairly well characterised for a\n\n subset of their hazards and exposures\n\n~ 20 000 chemicals\nwith limited characterisation for\n\ntheir hazards and exposures\n\n~ 70 000 chemicals\nwith poor characterisation for\ntheir hazards and exposures \n\nHAZARDS EXPOSURES\n\nRISKS\n\n37\n\nSource: EEA report - The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 202045.\n\nThe unknown territory of chemical risks\nThere are many chemicals on the market and only a small fraction of these have been extensively \nstudied for their risks. Designing safe products with a smaller number of different chemicals is one way \nof reducing potential risks.\n\n37\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer-2020\f\n38 \u00a9 Kai Dahms, Unsplash\n\nThe chemicals we eat\n\nPesticides are another group of chemicals \nthat can harm our health, mostly as a result \nof the consumption of vegetables and \nfruit that have been in contact with them. \nChildren are especially vulnerable, partly \nbecause they eat proportionally more food \nper kilogram of body weight than adults \ndo. Eating organic produce can decrease \nthis pesticide burden but not everyone can \nafford that.\n\nThe EU regulates pesticides under the \nRegulation on Plant Protection Products \nand sets safe limits for pesticide residues \nin food and feed. The latest information \nfrom the European Food Safety Authority \n(EFSA)46 shows that 95.5\u00a0% of food samples \ncollected across the EU in 2018 were \nwithin legal limits. Table grapes and bell \npeppers were among the food products \nthat most frequently exceeded the legal \nlevels of residue. Still, based on the samples \nanalysed, containing both regular and \norganic produce, the probability of European \ncitizens being exposed to dangerous levels \nof pesticide residue is considered low.\n\nNot all chemical substances harmful to \nour health are new. For example, mercury \nis naturally present in the environment \nand has been released in air and water by \nhuman activity for centuries. However, today \nwe know that ingesting mercury can affect \nthe nervous system, kidneys and lungs, and \nexposure during pregnancy can affect the \ndevelopment of the fetus.\n\n38\n\nhttps://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6057\f\n39\n\nPeople are exposed to mercury mainly \nthrough eating large predatory fish, such as \ntuna, shark, swordfish, pike, zander, eel and \nmarlin. This also means that exposure can be \nlimited by dietary choices, which is important \nespecially for vulnerable groups, such as \nexpectant mothers and young children.\n\nFor a more complete picture of human \nexposure to chemicals, there is a need for \ndata on what is in our bodies. This includes \nchemicals that we eat as well as those that \nenter through other exposure pathways. \nThese types of human biomonitoring data \ncan be used to improve chemical risk \nassessments by providing information on \nactual human exposure through multiple \nexposure pathways.\n\nHuman biomonitoring \u2014 measuring our exposure to chemicals\n\nHuman biomonitoring measures people\u2019s exposure to chemicals by analysing the \nsubstances themselves, their metabolites or markers of subsequent health effects \nin urine, blood, hair or tissue. Information on human exposure can be linked to \ndata on sources and epidemiological surveys, in order to inform research on the \nexposure\u2011response relationships in\u00a0humans.\n\nThe European human biomonitoring initiative, HBM4EU47, launched in 2017 and \nco-funded under Horizon 2020, is a joint effort of 30 countries, the EEA and the \nEuropean Commission.\n\nThe main aim of the initiative is to coordinate and advance human biomonitoring in \nEurope. HBM4EU will provide better evidence of the actual exposure of citizens to \nchemicals and the possible health effects to support policymaking. The project has also \nset up focus groups to understand EU citizen\u2019s perspectives on chemical exposure and \nhuman biomonitoring.\n\nUnder HBM4EU, efforts are under way to generate robust and coherent data sets \non the exposure of the European population to chemicals of concern. This includes \nproducing exposure data on 16 substance groups, mixtures of chemicals and \nemerging chemicals, as\u00a0well as exploring exposure pathways and linking exposure to \nhealth\u00a0effects.\n\nVisit: www.hbm4eu.eu\n\nhttps://www.hbm4eu.eu/\f\n40 \u00a9 Sebastian \u0160koi\u0107, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA40\n\f\n41\u00a9 Sebastian \u0160koi\u0107, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 41\n\nChemical effects on nature\n\nSynthetic chemicals released into nature can affect plants and animals. For example, \nneonicotinoids are a type of insecticide used in agriculture to control pests that pose \nrisks to bees, as bees are important pollinators supporting food production. Pesticides \ncan also affect fish and bird populations and entire food chains. In 2013, the European \nCommission severely restricted48 the use of plant protection products and treated \nseeds containing certain neonicotinoids to protect\u00a0honeybees49.\n\nTowards a safer chemical \nenvironment\n\nThe EU has the strictest and most advanced \nrules in the world when it comes to \nchemicals. The REACH Regulation is the \nkey piece of legislation that aims to protect \nhuman health and the environment, \nand the EU has put in place rules for the \nclassification, labelling and packaging \nof\u00a0chemicals50.\n\nThe EU has a body of legislation to regulate \nchemicals in detergents, biocides, plant \nprotection products and pharmaceuticals. \nPolicies limit the use of hazardous chemicals \nin personal care products, cosmetics, \ntextiles, electronic equipment and food \ncontact materials. Limits are also in place \nfor chemicals in the air, food and drinking \nwater. Legislation addresses point source \nemissions from industrial installations and \nfrom urban waste water treatment plants.\n\nStill, there is room for improvement to \ncreate a less toxic environment, and the \nEuropean Green Deal aims to further protect \ncitizens against dangerous chemicals with a \nnew chemicals strategy and by moving the \nEU towards the zero pollution ambition.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Chemicals: www.eea.europa.eu/\nthemes/human/chemicals\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 10 on chemical \npollution: www.eea.europa.eu/\npublications/soer-2020/chapter-10_\nsoer2020-chemical-pollution/view\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_13_708\f\n42\n\nIn\nte\n\nrv\nie\n\nw\n\nProfessor Geert \nVan\u00a0Calster\nUniversity of Leuven\n\n\u00a9 Linz Verendet on Unsplash\n\f\n43\n\nDoes the polluter pay?\nA simple but powerful idea lies at the heart of environmental laws in the EU: the \n\u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle. This principle has been applied in the form of taxes, fines and \nother measures, such as quotas for pollutant emissions and the Environmental Liability \nDirective. We talked to Professor Geert Van Calster about this principle, its benefits \nand\u00a0shortcomings.\n\nWhat is the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 \nprinciple\u00a0about?\n\nThe \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle is a simple \nprinciple based on common sense: the \npolluter \u2014 and this could be the actors or \nthe activity causing the pollution \u2014 should \npay to right the wrong. This could entail \ncleaning up the polluted area or covering the \nhealth costs of the people affected.\n\nHistorically, it has been a very powerful \nconcept to mitigate the negative impacts \nof pollution. It provided a moral and legal \nimperative to take action. In pressing \ncases, it helped formulate policies and \nmeasures, which allowed for decisive action \nto identify pollution sources and their \nliability, reduce pollution levels and provide \nsome compensation to those affected. For \nexample, some economic activities known \nto release pollutants had to install filters \nto reduce pollutant emissions or establish \nsector-wide compensation funds.\n\nBut even in simple cases, where the polluter \ncan be identified, implementation can be \ndifficult. The \u2018culprit\u2019 may be unable to pay \nand the mother corporation or shareholders \ncannot always be held liable for the activities \nof a subsidiary. Not every country has a \n\nwell-established legal framework to handle \nthese cases. Even if they do, a legal process \nis often very lengthy and costly.\n\nMoreover, with time, the principle has \nbeen applied to more complex cases of \npersistent and prevalent pollution, such \nas air pollution resulting from diffuse \nsources, where attributing responsibility and \nimplementation get even more difficult.\n\nHow can we define who needs to \npay whom?\n\nIn diffuse pollution cases, it is not easy to \ntrack and identify the polluter and connect \nit with the people affected. Air pollution \ncan be caused by pollutants released from \ndifferent sources and different locations, \nsome of which may lie across international \nborders. We also need to think about the \npositive outcomes and benefits of these \npolluting activities. These are products and \nservices, such as food, clothes, transport, \nwhich benefit us individually and the society \nas a whole.\n\nFor example, polluting activities outside the \nEU could be affecting local communities but \nthe mother holding could be based in the EU \nand European consumers could be enjoying \n\f\n44 \u00a9 Perry Wunderlich, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nthe products. It is difficult to hold only the \noperator accountable in these cases. The \nwider society often bears the costs.\n\nBut the costs or the harm and the benefits \nare not distributed equally. Lower income \ncommunities or more vulnerable groups \nlike single parent families tend to live closer \nto roads and be more exposed to pollutants \nfrom road transport.\n\nAre there any good examples of \neffective measures?\n\nThere are two different types of \napproaches. The first aims at helping \nthose affected and there are many good \nexamples in Europe. The noise abatement \npanels or similar structures built along \nmotorways can reduce noise levels \nsignificantly and hence the harm to those \nliving there.\n\nThe second type aims at limiting or \npreventing pollution or harmful activities \nin the first place. These could consist of \nimposing taxes, pollution quotas or certain \ntechnological solutions. For example, \nEurope is introducing cleaner fuels or is \ngradually decreasing carbon emissions \nfrom new cars. For some sectors, \nemissions allowances are capped and \ncan be traded. Some of these measures \naim at adjusting the price in such a way \nas to influence consumption behaviour. \nSimilarly, many Member States now charge \nby the quantity extracted or used instead \nof the number of taps, which has changed \nhow we use water substantially.\n\f\n45\n\nAre there any shortcomings in \nthe way we apply the \u2018polluter \npays\u2019\u00a0principle?\n\nUnfortunately, the current system can be \nseen and used as a \u2018licence to pollute\u2019: as \nlong as you can pay \u2014 meaning if you can \nafford it, you are allowed to pollute. This is \nclosely linked to the unequal distribution of \nbenefits and costs of these polluting activities. \nThe inequality issue also lies at the heart of \nglobal climate negotiations, both in terms of \nhistoric emissions (the amount each country \nhas emitted so far) and current emissions per \nperson. In an ideal world, everyone would be \ngiven an equal amount of carbon credit.\n\nThe second main shortcoming is that the \n\u2018payment\u2019 hardly ever covers all the \u2018costs\u2019. \nThe contaminated land in old industrial sites \nmight be cleaned up to allow for people to \nlive there. It is a very costly operation but it \ndoes not necessarily undo the harm done \nto the water bodies or to the people and \nanimals dependent on that water. Costs are \noften limited to operational costs and do not \nreflect the real value of the benefits we get \nfrom nature.\n\nCan we design a system that \ncovers\u00a0the full value?\n\nWe need a coherent and global approach \nthat addresses all the challenges we face \u2014 \nenvironmental degradation, climate change, \nresource use and inequalities \u2014 in the same \nway that the Sustainable Development Goals \ndo. The European Green Deal aims to bring \nsome of this thinking into European policies.\n\nTo cover the real value, we would need a \nmuch more ambitious taxation system, both \nfor corporate and personal tax, designed \nto induce a more sustainable behaviour. \nAnd, costs need to be integrated not only \ndownstream on the consumption side but \nalso upstream on the production side. As \nconsumption and production systems are \nconnected globally, integration requires an \napproach that extends beyond sovereign \nstates\u2019 rules and regulations.\n\nTo be effective, this approach needs to \nbe backed by a governance system with \nregulators that can ensure and enforce a \nlevel playing field with well-defined rules. \nOn the ground, in addition to ambitious \ntaxes and common standards, measures \nlike anti-dumping duties and carbon border \ntaxes as well as a common approach \ntowards environmentally harmful subsidies \nwill be\u00a0necessary.\n\nProfessor Geert Van Calster\nHead of Leuven Law\u2019s department of \nEuropean and international law\nUniversity of Leuven\n\f\n\u00a9 Carolina Pimenta, Unsplash46\n\f\n47\n\nThe challenge of reducing \nindustrial pollution\nIndustrial pollution in Europe is decreasing, thanks to a blend of regulation, developments \nin manufacturing and environmental initiatives. However, industry continues to pollute \nand moving towards zero pollution in this sector is an ambitious challenge.\n\nWe can categorise pollution by where we \nfind it \u2014 in air, water or soil \u2014 or we can \nlook at different pollution types, such as \nchemicals, noise or light. Another way to \nlook at pollution is to go to its sources. \nSome pollution sources are spread out, \nsuch as cars, agriculture and buildings, but \nothers can be better assessed as individual \nemission points. Many of these point \nsources are large installations, such as \nfactories and power plants.\n\nIndustry is a key component of Europe\u2019s \neconomy. According to Eurostat, in 2018, \nit accounted for 17.6\u00a0% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and directly employed \n36\u00a0million people. At the same time, industry \nalso accounts for more than half of the total \nemissions of some key air pollutants and \ngreenhouse gases, as well as other important \nenvironmental impacts, including the release \nof pollutants to water and soil, the generation \nof waste and energy consumption.\n\nAir pollution is often associated with the \nburning of fossil fuels. This obviously applies \nto power plants but also to many other \nindustrial activities that may have their \nown onsite electricity or heat production, \nsuch as iron and steel manufacturing or \ncement production. Some activities generate \ndust that contributes to particulate matter \n\nconcentrations in the air, whereas solvent \nuse, for example in metal processing or \nchemical production, may lead to emissions \nof polluting organic compounds.\n\nIndustrial air emission trends\n\nAir emissions from industry in Europe have \ndecreased over recent years. Between 2007 \nand 2017, overall emissions of sulphur \noxides (SOx) declined by 54\u00a0%, nitrogen \noxides (NOx) by more than one third and \ngreenhouse gases from industry, including \npower plants, by 12\u00a0%51.\n\nThese improvements in environmental \nperformance by European industry \nhave occurred for a number of reasons, \nincluding stricter environmental regulation, \nimprovements in energy efficiency, a \nmove towards less polluting types of \nmanufacturing processes and voluntary \nschemes to reduce environmental impact.\n\nFor many years, environmental regulation \nhas limited the adverse impacts of industrial \nactivities on human health and the \nenvironment. Key EU measures targeting \nindustrial emissions include the Industrial \nEmissions Directive, which covers about \n52\u00a0000 of the largest industrial plants, and \nthe Medium Combustion Plants Directive. \n\f\n48\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading System (EU \nETS), meanwhile, limits greenhouse gas \nemissions from more than 12\u00a0000 power \ngeneration and manufacturing installations \nin 31 countries. The EU ETS covers around \n45\u00a0% of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, despite these improvements, \nindustry is still responsible for a significant \nburden on our environment in terms of \npollution and waste generation.\n\nPublic accountability \u2014 the \nE-PRTR and transparency of \nindustrial emissions data\n\nThe European Pollutant Release and \nTransfer Register (E-PRTR) was set up \nin 2006 to enhance public access to \nenvironmental\u00a0information.\n\nIn essence, the E-PRTR enables citizens and \nstakeholders to learn about pollution in all \ncorners of Europe, who the top polluters \nare and whether or not pollutant emission \ntrends are improving.\n\nThe E\u2011PRTR covers more than 34\u00a0000 \nfacilities across 33 European countries. \nE-PRTR data show, for each facility and \nyear, information concerning the amount \nof pollutants released to air, water and \nland, as well as off-site transfers of waste \nand pollutants in waste water. E-PRTR \ndata are freely available on a dedicated, \ninteractive website52. The website \narchives historical data on releases \nand transfers of 91 pollutants across \n65\u00a0economic\u00a0activities.\n\nMoreover, the E-PRTR is now integrated \nwith wider reporting under the Industrial \nEmissions Directive, including further \ninformation for large combustion plants53. \nTogether with the European Commission, \nthe EEA is currently working on a new \nwebsite to improve access to these data \nand\u00a0information.\n\nCounting the costs of industrial \nair pollution\n\nIn order to account for the external costs \nof air pollution, an individual pollutant\u2019s \nadverse impacts on human health and the \nenvironment are expressed in a common \nmetric, a monetary value, which has been \ndeveloped through cooperation between \ndifferent scientific and economic disciplines.\n\nDamage cost estimates are just that \u2014 \nestimates. However, when considered \nalongside other sources of information, they \ncan support decisions by drawing attention \nto the implicit trade-offs in decision-making, \nsuch as the cost-benefit analyses used \nto inform impact assessments and \nsubsequent\u00a0legislation.\n\nThe EEA estimated in 2014 that the \naggregated cost of damage over the 5-year \nperiod 2008-2012 caused by emissions \nfrom E-PRTR industrial facilities was at least \nEUR\u00a0329 billion (2005 value) and rising54. \nWhat is perhaps even more striking in this \nanalysis is that about half of the damage \ncosts occurred as a result of emissions from \nonly 147, or 1\u00a0%, of the 14\u00a0000 facilities in \nthe\u00a0data set.\n\f\n49\u00a9 Veeterzy, Unsplash\n\nThe majority of the quantified damage \ncosts is caused by emissions of the \nmain air pollutants and carbon dioxide. \nAlthough damage cost estimates \nassociated with heavy metal and organic \npollutant emissions are significantly lower, \nthey still cause hundreds of millions \nof euros in harm to health and the \nenvironment and can cause significant \nadverse impacts on the local scale. The \nEEA is currently working on a new study \nthat will update these\u00a0figures.\n\nReducing industrial pollution \n\u2014 assessment, legislation \nand\u00a0implementation\n\nThe EEA regularly assesses trends in \nindustrial pollution in Europe55 based \non E-PRTR and other data. These \nassessments show that industrial pollution \nhas decreased over the past decade for \nemissions to both air and water. Existing \nand incoming EU policy instruments are \nexpected to further reduce industrial \nemissions, but pollution is likely to \ncontinue to have adverse impacts on \nhuman health and the environment in \nthe\u00a0future.\n\nA strong, growing, low-carbon industry \nbased on circular material flows is part of \nthe EU industrial policy strategy56. The goal \nis to create a growing industrial sector that \ndraws less and less on natural resources, \nreduces pollutant emissions to air, water \nand land, and generates decreasing \namounts of waste.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/ds_resolveuid/IND-446-en\f\n30 Million tonnes (Mt)\nof waste generated in EU (2015)\n\n17 %\ncollected for reuse or recycling (5 Mt)\n\n83 %\nlost (25 Mt)\n57 %\nloss through landfilling and energy recovery\n\nMany other adverse \nenvironmental \nconsequences are \nassociated to the loss\nof plastic materials, \nsuch as  release of \nmicroplastics into the \nenvironment.\n\n1 tonne of plastics \nresults in 2.5 tonnes of \nCO2 emissions from \nproduction and\n2.7 tonnes of CO2 \nemissions if \nincinerated. \n\n+ +\n+ CO2 +\n\nProcess\nlosses in\nrecycling\n\nTypes of plastic waste\n\n16.3 Mt\nplastic\npackaging\nwaste\n\n1-1.5 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom construction\nand demolition \n\n1.2 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom end-of-life\nvehicles\n\n2.4 Mt\nplastic waste\nfrom e-waste\n\n50\n\nMeanwhile, other EU legislation sets more \nconcrete air emission reduction targets, \nsuch as the National Emission Ceilings \nDirective57 and the Industrial Emissions \nDirective58, which aim to achieve the \nambitious prevention and reduction \nof emissions, in particular through the \ncontinuous uptake of so-called best \navailable techniques (BATs).\n\nAccording to a recent EEA analysis59, using \nbest available techniques and implementing \nthe more ambitious targets of the \nIndustrial Emissions Directive would result \nin substantial emission reductions: 91\u00a0% \nfor sulphur dioxide, 82\u00a0% for particulate \nmatter and 79\u00a0% for nitrogen oxides. Fully \nimplementing these directives would help \nthe EU achieve environmental objectives, \nsuch as those on air and water quality. \n\nHowever, the emission-related directives \noften act independently and there is \nclear scope for further integration of \nthe environmental objectives into the \nEU\u2019s industrial policy.

Loud cars on the street, \na low-flying plane overhead or a nearby train often bring with them annoyance and \nfrustration. However, their impact on our health and environment could be a lot worse \nthan you think.\n\nWe often think about pollution in terms of \nwhere it can be detected: pollution of air, \nwater or soil. However, there are also some \nvery specific types of pollution that harm \npeople and wildlife.\n\nAt least one in five Europeans is currently \nexposed to road traffic noise levels \nconsidered harmful to their health. This \nnumber is even higher in urban areas and \nthe problem is widespread across most \ncities in Europe. Road traffic is by far the \ntop source of noise pollution in Europe, \naccording to a recent EEA noise report61 \nthat looked at noise from roads, railways, \nairports and industry. These sources are in \nline with the Environmental Noise Directive, \nwhich does not cover noise from, for \nexample, domestic activities or neighbours, \nor noise in workplaces.\n\nNoise can be bad for your health\n\nAn estimated 113 million Europeans \nare affected by long-term exposure to \nday-evening-night traffic noise levels of at \n\nleast 55 decibels. In addition, 22 million \nEuropeans are exposed to high levels of \nnoise from railways, 4 million to high levels \nof aircraft noise and fewer than 1 million to \nhigh levels of noise caused by industries.\n\nWhat many people may not know is that \nlong-term exposure to noise, even at the \nlevels we are used to in urban areas, has \nsignificant health impacts. In most European \ncountries, more than 50\u00a0% of people living \nin urban areas are exposed to road noise \nlevels of 55 decibels or higher during \nthe measured day-evening-night period. \nLong-term exposure to this level, according \nto the World Health Organization (WHO), is \nlikely to have negative impacts on health.\n\nThe EEA estimates that long-term exposure \nto environmental noise causes 12\u00a0000 \npremature deaths and contributes to 48\u00a0000 \nnew cases of ischaemic heart disease every \nyear across Europe. It is also estimated \nthat 22 million people suffer chronic high \nannoyance and 6.5 million people suffer \nchronic high sleep disturbance.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-noise-in-europe\f\n54\n\nAccording to WHO evidence, these \nhealth impacts start to occur even below \nthe 55\u00a0decibel noise level for the day\u2011\nevening-night period and the 50 decibel \nnoise level for the night period, which are \nthe reporting thresholds set out by the \nEU\u2019s Environmental Noise Directive62. \n\nTherefore, these numbers are likely to \nbe underestimated. Furthermore, the \ninformation provided by countries under \nEU law do not cover all urban areas, \nroads, railways and airports, nor do they \ncover all sources of noise.\n\n What the EU is doing to reduce noise pollution\n\nPeople\u2019s exposure to noise is monitored under the Environmental Noise Directive \nagainst two reporting thresholds: an indicator for the day-evening-night period (Lden), \nwhich measures exposure to noise levels associated with \u2018annoyance\u2019, and an indicator \nfor the night period (Lnight), which is designed to assess sleep disturbance. These \nreporting thresholds are higher than the World Health Organization-recommended \nvalues and currently there is no mechanism in place for tracking progress against the \nlatter lower\u00a0values.\n\nWildlife is affected too\n\nNoise also has a negative impact on wildlife, \nboth on land and in the water. Noise \npollution can cause a range of physical and \nbehavioural effects on animals and increase \ntheir stress.\n\nFor instance, road traffic noise can make \nit difficult for frogs and songbirds to \ncommunicate with each other, especially \nduring mating season. This can reduce their \nability to reproduce or force them to flee \ntheir habitats.\n\nUnderwater noise from shipping, energy \nproduction, construction and other activities \nis another concern. For example, research \nhas found hearing damage in whales, which \ncan harm their ability to communicate with \neach other and find food.\n\nShh! Quiet please!\n\nEuropean countries have taken a number of \nmeasures to reduce and manage noise levels. \nHowever, it has been difficult to evaluate their \nbenefits in terms of positive health outcomes, \naccording to the EEA\u2019s noise report.\n\nExamples of the most popular measures to \nreduce noise levels in cities include replacing \nolder paved roads with smoother asphalt, \nbetter management of traffic flows and \nreducing speed limits to 30 kilometres per \nhour. Some cities have also implemented \nprojects aimed at masking traffic noise by \nplacing more pleasant-to-the-ear noises, \nsuch as running waterfalls, in city centres. \nThere are also measures aimed at raising \nawareness and changing people\u2019s behaviour \nin using less-noisy modes of transport, such \nas cycling, walking and electric vehicles.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/noise/directive.htm\f\n\u00a9 M\u00e1t\u00e9 Ladj\u00e1nszki, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 55\n\f\n56\n\nA number of cities and regions have also \nput in place so-called quiet areas, most of \nwhich are parks and other green spaces, \nwhere people can go to escape city noise. \nThese areas, the creation and designation \nand protection of which are encouraged by \nEU rules, can bring significant environmental \nand health benefits, according to a 2016 EEA \nreport on quiet areas in Europe63.\n\nHowever, EEA research found issues related \nto the availability of and access to these \nsites, especially in noisier city centres, where \nquiet green spaces are hard to find and not \nreachable within a 10-minute walk from \npeople\u2019s homes.\n\nCOVID-19 and noise\n\nNoise pollution from transport sources, such as road, rail or air traffic, is linked to \neconomic activity. Therefore, a significant short-term reduction in transportation \nnoise levels can be expected as a result of COVID-19-related lockdowns. However, \nenvironmental noise levels are reported over a prolonged period, as health effects \nappear when exposure is long term. As such, a short-term reduction in noise levels \nwould not significantly reduce the annual noise level indicator used to measure the \neffects of noise.\n\nFind out more: https://www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore64.\n\nTurn down the volume\n\nIt is clear that we cannot live without sound \nor noise and reducing noise pollution to \n\u2018zero\u2019 is unrealistic. However, the EU is \nworking to make sure that noise levels \nare reduced so they do less harm to our \nenvironment and health. This is a big task.\n\nIt is already clear that the EU\u2019s 2020 \nobjective on reducing noise pollution, as \ndefined by the EU\u2019s 7th Environment Action \nProgramme65 of decreasing noise pollution \nand moving towards WHO-recommended \nlevels for noise exposure, will not be met. \n\nMany EU Member States will need to do \nmore to take the steps needed to address \nnoise pollution, especially in implementing \nthe EU\u2019s Environmental Noise Directive.\n\nFind out more\n\n\u2022 Noise: www.eea.europa.eu/themes/\nhuman/noise\n\n\u2022 SOER 2020, Chapter 11 on \nenvironmental noise: www.eea.europa.\neu/publications/soer-2020/chapter-11_\nsoer2020-environmental-noise/view\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/quiet-areas-in-europe\f\n20 % of the EU population \u2014 one in five people \u2014 live in areas where noise \nlevels are considered harmful to health. \n\nHigh\nannoyance\n\nImpacts of environmental noise in Europe\n\n22 000 000\n\nHigh sleep\ndisturbance\n\n6 500 000\n\nPremature\nmortality\n\n12 000\n\nHeart\ndisease\n\n48 000 Cognitive\nimpairment in \n\n12 500\n\nchildren\n\nNoise pollution\nNoise pollution is a growing environmental concern.

We talked about \npollution and health with Francesca Racioppi, Head of the WHO European Centre for \nEnvironment and Health.\n\nWhat are the most dangerous kinds \nof pollution and their health impacts \naffecting Europeans and their \nhealth\u00a0impacts?\n\nIn Europe (meaning the 53 Member States of \nthe WHO Regional Office for Europe \u2014 more \nthan 900 million people), environmental \nrisk factors still account for 1.4 million \ndeaths per year and these deaths are to \na large extent preventable. More than a \nthird of these deaths are attributable to air \npollution, which is the single most important \nenvironmental risk factor for our health. \nAnother big proportion of pollution harm \ncomes from hazardous chemicals. And, \nunfortunately, every day seven people, \nmostly children, die from diarrhoeal-related \ndiseases so even water quality remains a \nproblem. Even within the EU, in some rural \nareas, we have not yet achieved 100\u00a0% \naccess to clean water and sanitation.\n\nWe still have a long way to go with \nenvironment and health but we can also \nbe very clever in the way we join different \nagendas. For example, addressing air \nquality can mean addressing climate change \nemissions at the same time.\n\nHow did the effects of pollution \non health change in Europe in the \npast\u00a0decades?\n\nIn Europe, the situation has improved \nsignificantly. I was young at the time \nwhen the first legislations were brought \ninto place to fight the acid rains and the \neutrophication of lakes and seawater. \nWe were perhaps the first in some \nindustrial developments that were very \nproblematic and we were also the first \nto be confronted with massive pollution \nand we had to deal with that. We have \nlearned that you need common rules \nto deal with pollution because it knows \nno\u00a0borders.\n\nOf course, now we live in a globalised \nworld and we have to acknowledge that \npollution does not respect continental \nborders either. We have seen some \nissues moving from Europe to other \nregions where some dangerous \nindustrial practices are still allowed, \nso we have a responsibility that goes \nbeyond Europe, a responsibility for \nglobal health and that our policies \nsupport cleaner production.\n\f\n60\n\nDoes air pollution \ninfluence\u00a0the evolution of the \nCOVID\u201119\u00a0pandemic?\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions \nregarding the relation between air quality \nand COVID-19 and it is a topic of current \nscientific investigation. However, there \nare some statements that we can already \nmake. Improving air quality would never \nbe wrong because we know that air \npollution is an important risk factor for and \ncause of respiratory and cardiovascular \ndiseases. People who have these underlying \nconditions have shown increased \nvulnerability to COVID-19 and are at a \nhigher risk of reporting severe\u00a0symptoms.\n\nIn the short term, we have seen an \nimportant reduction of air pollution across \ncities. This reduction is more prominent in \nthe case of nitrogen oxides, a pollutant very \nmuch related to traffic, which is one of the \nactivities most affected by the lockdown \nmeasures. There is a lot of research that \nis going on around this as we are speaking \nand from which we will learn and benefit \nin the future. COVID-19 is an unfolding \ntragedy but, at the same time, it has given \nus a glimpse at unprecedented data that \ncould perhaps help us rethink the way to a \n\u2018new normal\u2019 that can deliver environmental \nand health\u00a0benefits.\n\nCan this crisis be a push towards a \nsustainable economy?\n\nIt is excellent that the European Commission \nhas been working on the European Green \nDeal because it is a very strong commitment \nthat can give a huge leverage to frame the \n\nrecovery in a sustainable manner. There is \nan unprecedented opportunity for this \u2018new \nnormal\u2019 to be a leap towards sustainable \neconomic development and we are \nlooking forward to working towards that in \ncollaboration with the Commission.\n\nWhat would be the easiest methods \nto decrease pollution?\n\nIf we focus on the example of air pollution, we \nneed to address the sectors where it originates \n\u2014 the energy sector, transport, agriculture, \nwaste management and many industries \u2014 \nworking from local to global scales. A lot has \nbeen done over the past decades, but we still \nsee that globally, 90\u00a0% of people are living \nin cities that do not meet WHO\u2019s air quality \nguideline values. This means that we still have \na significant way to go that requires working \nwith the different sectors to see how we can \npromote cleaner and safer transportation \nsystems, for example. For all sectors there are \npositive ways forward.\n\nI think it is also important to acknowledge \nthat the effects of pollution in general, \nand of air pollution in particular, are not \nequally distributed. People who live in more \ndeprived areas, very often live close to \ncontaminated sites or in areas where there \nis a very high flow of traffic. The differences \ncan be large, not only between countries, \nbut also within countries.\n\nWhat is WHO Europe doing in the \nfield of environment and pollution?\n\nFor more than 30 years, our core mission, \nas WHO, is to work with our Member States \nand within countries to support them in \n\f\n61\n\naddressing their environment and health \npriorities. This came up very clearly at the \nlast European Ministerial Conference on \nEnvironment and Health that took place in \nOstrava in 2017. All 53 Member States came \ntogether and agreed to develop national \nportfolios for action on environment and \nhealth. We are at their side, supporting \nthem in identifying the national priorities, \nand then supporting the work in that \ndirection.\n\nAlso, we are continuing the normative work \nof the WHO: our Centre is coordinating \nthe update of the WHO global air quality \nguidelines. Last year we launched the WHO \nenvironmental noise guidelines, providing \npublic health-oriented recommendations \nto support legislation and policymaking for \nstandards in our Member States and at the \nEuropean level.\n\nDo you expect the new WHO \nguidelines regarding noise and the \nforthcoming update on air pollution \nto be adopted by the EU as well?\n\nI hope so. The WHO guidelines provide \nrobust recommendations based on the \n\nmost updated scientific evidence of what \nwe know of the relationship between \nhealth and air pollution or environmental \nnoise. From that point it is a political \ndecision whether to refer to those \nguideline values when setting standards. \nWe know that the European Commission \nrefers frequently to WHO guidelines. For \nexample, the EU Drinking Water Directive \nwas revised based on the health-based \nrecommendations and guideline values in \nthe latest edition of the WHO guidelines \nfor drinking-water quality. Environmental \nnoise guidelines for the European region \nare considered in the revision of the \nEnvironmental Noise Directive. The \ndebate remains open when it comes to \nthe forthcoming update of the global air \nquality guidelines on how they will be \nreflected in European Union policies. We \nhave to respect the political process and \nthe deliberations of the EU and its Member \nStates but we hope that those policies will \npromote and protect health, and we are \nhere to support them.\n\nFrancesca Racioppi\nHead of the WHO European Centre for \nEnvironment and Health\n\f\nExamples of applications\n\nCopernicus, the EU earth \nobservation programme,\nis delivering unprecedented \namounts of environmental and \nclimate data.
