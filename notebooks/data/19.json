{"query": "Why is urban sprawl bad?", "texts": ["Conservation status of species under the EU Habitats Directive\nAt EU level, only 27 % of species assessments have a good conservation status, with 63 % having a poor or bad conservation status. Only 6 % of all species have improving trends. Reptiles and vascular plants have the highest proportion of good conservation status. The EU did not meet its 2020 target to improve the conservation status of EU protected species and habitats. At Member State level, a large proportion of assessments show few species with a good conservation status. Agriculture, urban sprawl, forestry and pollution are the pressures on species reported most.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|EU status||Number of assessments||Percentage|\n|Good||776||28|\n|Unknown||288||10|\n|Poor||1180||42|\n|Bad||581||20|\nThe Habitats Directive protects 1 389 animal and plant species of Community interest, including endangered, vulnerable, rare and endemic species, or those requiring particular attention. The directive outlines requirements for their protection and sustainable use. EU Member States report on the conservation status and trends of those species every 6 years.\nFigure 1 shows the results of 2 825 assessments of the conservation status of species at EU level for the period 2013-2018. Only 27 % of species assessments have a good conservation status and 63 % indicate an unfavourable conservation status: 42 % poor and 21 % bad. The trends indicate that only 6 % of species with an unfavourable conservation status show improvement, while 35 % continue to deteriorate at EU level (for more information see EEA, 2020f).\nThe species groups with the highest proportion of good conservation status are reptiles and vascular plants, with 40 % and 36 %, respectively. Except for mammals, fish and non-vascular plants (10 %, 9 % and 6 %, respectively), improvements in unfavourable conservation status for other species are below 5 %. More effective conservation efforts are needed, especially for molluscs and fish, each with around 30 % of species with a bad conservation status. (for more information about other species groups see EEA, 2020f).\nAcross terrestrial biogeographical regions, the proportion of species assessments showing a good conservation status is highest in the Steppic region (43 %) and lowest in the Atlantic region (19 %).\nResults of reporting under the Habitats Directive are also used to assess progress made towards targets 1 and 3 of the EU Biodiversity strategy to 2020. Target 1 \u2014 to improve the conservation status of EU protected species and habitats by 2020 \u2014 was not reached for species, with a 2 % gap remaining. Moreover, a high share of species assessments show further deteriorating trends. Target 3 was to optimise the benefits of agriculture and forestry for biodiversity. Analysis of grassland species assessments shows a mixed picture: only 5 % of grassland species show an improving conservation status, but also with a lower share of deteriorating trends than other groups. The EEA publishes more about progress towards achieving these targets.\n|country||Good-ABS||Unknown-ABS||Poor-ABS||Bad-ABS||Good||Unknown||Poor||Bad||total|\n|Croatia (418)||30||196||100||92||7.18||46.89||23.92||22.01||418|\n|Austria (336)||49||8||164||115||14.58||2.38||48.81||34.23||336|\n|Luxembourg (60)||9||1||23||27||15||1.67||38.33||45||60|\n|Spain (671)||127||102||266||176||18.93||15.2||39.64||26.23||671|\n|Denmark (122)||24||24||33||41||19.67||19.67||27.05||33.61||122|\n|Slovakia (320)||75||4||172||69||23.44||1.25||53.75||21.56||320|\n|Belgium (138)||35||11||43||49||25.36||7.97||31.16||35.51||138|\n|Germany (370)||95||40||112||123||25.68||10.81||30.27||33.24||370|\n|Netherlands (80)||21||4||24||31||26.25||5||30||38.75||80|\n|Portugal (437)||117||132||138||50||26.77||30.21||31.58||11.44||437|\n|France (645)||181||84||219||161||28.06||13.02||33.95||24.96||645|\n|Slovenia (332)||97||59||129||47||29.22||17.77||38.86||14.16||332|\n|Czechia (267)||81||15||102||69||30.34||5.62||38.2||25.84||267|\n|Hungary (212)||74||113||25||34.91||53.3||11.79||212|\n|Greece (297)||104||30||126||37||35.02||10.1||42.42||12.46||297|\n|Lithuania (98)||36||18||31||13||36.73||18.37||31.63||13.27||98|\n|Poland (257)||97||40||88||32||37.74||15.56||34.24||12.45||257|\n|Bulgaria (444)||169||123||138||14||38.06||27.7||31.08||3.15||444|\n|Latvia (109)||43||9||42||15||39.45||8.26||38.53||13.76||109|\n|United Kingdom (108)||45||23||24||16||41.67||21.3||22.22||14.81||108|\n|Italy (569)||248||22||206||93||43.59||3.87||36.2||16.34||569|\n|Finland (159)||72||12||54||21||45.28||7.55||33.96||13.21||159|\n|Romania (621)||284||57||227||53||45.73||9.18||36.55||8.53||621|\n|Sweden (273)||130||2||45||96||47.62||0.73||16.48||35.16||273|\n|Malta (45)||24||10||7||4||53.33||22.22||15.56||8.89||45|\n|Estonia (96)||54||7||25||10||56.25||7.29||26.04||10.42||96|\n|Ireland (60)||34||8||9||9||56.67||13.33||15||15||60|\n|Cyprus (55)||35||7||11||2||63.64||12.73||20||3.64||55|\n|EU status||2301||930||2830||1506||30.41||12.29||37.4||19.9||7567|\nMember State reporting shows that there is significant variation in the conservation status of species across territories (Figure 2).

Vegetation productivity is a key indicator of ecosystem condition and can be used to monitor the effects of climate, land use and land use change. From 2000 to 2016, productivity in Europe showed a regional pattern of increase and decline, driven in part by climatic variation, but most notably by land use change. Agricultural land management and converting land for agriculture drove productivity increases, whereas urban sprawl caused declines.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Land use||% change|\n|lcf43 Internal conversions between permanent crops||80|\n|lcf72 Forest creation, afforestation||55|\n|lcf73 Forests internal conversions||55|\n|lcf53 Conversion from wetlands to agriculture||54|\n|lcf54 Conversion from developed areas to agriculture||53|\n|lcf42 Internal conversions between annual crops||50|\n|lcf52 Conversion from semi-natural land to agriculture||50|\n|lcf45 Conversion from arable land to permanent crops||41|\n|lcf44 Conversion from permanent crops to arable land||36|\n|lcf38 Sprawl of sport and leisure facilities||35|\n|lcf61 Withdrawal of farming with woodland creation||32|\n|lcf51 Conversion from forest to agriculture||31|\n|lcf74 Recent fellings, new plantation and other transition||30|\n|lcf71 Conversion from transitional woodland to forest||23|\n|lcf41 Extension of set aside fallow land and pasture||8|\n|lcf46 Conversion from pasture to arable and permanent crops||7|\n|lcf13 Development of green urban areas||2|\n|lcf62 Withdrawal of farming without significant woodland creation||-1|\n|lcf12 Recycling of developed urban land||-13|\n|lcf36 Sprawl of dumpsites||-17|\n|lcf22 Urban diffuse residential sprawl||-21|\n|lcf34 Sprawl of airports||-25|\n|lcf37 Construction||-25|\n|lcf32 Sprawl of transport networks||-26|\n|lcf11 Urban development/ infilling||-27|\n|lcf35 Sprawl of mines and quarrying areas||-28|\n|lcf31 Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites||-33|\nIntensive land use and land use change as a result of human activities cause ecosystem degradation, with loss of vegetation cover and biomass productivity. This is a major threat to the provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity and resilience to climate change and natural disasters, as recognised by the EU\u2019s Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP). The 7th EAP also recognises that, to inform approaches aimed at restoring and maintaining ecosystems, monitoring ecosystem condition is essential. Vegetation productivity indicates both the spatial distribution and the condition of vegetation cover and can therefore be used to assess the condition of ecosystems.\nBetween 2000 and 2016, vegetation productivity changed significantly across Europe. Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites was the most significant cause of declining vegetation productivity in Europe between 2000 and 2016, causing a 33% decline over 3,500 km2. The sprawl of mines and quarrying areas (over 2,100 km2) and of transport networks (covering 1,300 km2) caused a productivity decline of between 25% and 30% over the 17 years. All these processes, including construction sites and urban diffuse residential sprawl, destroy vegetated surfaces and, in the worst case, replace them with sealed areas, causing land degradation, increasing flood impacts and urban heat island effects and contributing to less carbon sequestration. Recycling of developed urban land also caused a decline in vegetation productivity (13%), although these processes reuse already developed lands and hence are better choices in terms of sustainable urban land management.\nForest creation and afforestation resulted in a 55% productivity increase, which had a positive impact on biodiversity and carbon sequestration. This land use change, however, only affected 3,600 km2, or fewer than 212 km2 a year in the entire territory of the EU-27 and the United Kingdom. Conversion from developed areas to agriculture \u2014 a land recultivation process that decreases land takeand increases land use efficiency \u2014 created 50% more vegetation productivity but only over a total of 570 km2.\nConverting semi natural lands to agriculture increased land productivity by 50%. However, this process destroys habitats and can be considered land degradation. Crop rotation increased productivity in the same way and over a comparable area (ca. 13,00 km2). This is mostly due to the intensive management of agricultural fields, which, in the long term, leads to land degradation due to the depletion of soil resources.\n|Country||lcf22 Urban diffuse residential sprawl||lcf31 Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites||lcf37 Construction||lcf411 Uniform extension of set aside fallow land and pasture||lcf421 Conversion from arable land to permanent irrigation perimeters||lcf451 Conversion from arable land to vineyards and orchards||lcf452 Conversion from arable land to olive groves||lcf462 Intensive conversion from pasture to non-irrigated arable land and permanent crops||lcf521 Intensive conversion from semi-natural land to agriculture||lcf61 Withdrawal of farming with woodland creation||lcf71 Conversion from transitional woodland to forest||lcf72 Forest creation, afforestation||lcf73 Forests internal conversions||lcf74 Recent fellings, new plantation and other transition|\n|Austria||48.8|\n|Bulgaria||52.6|\n|Croatia||23.2|\n|Czechia||40.5||14.1||42.7|\n|Estonia||7||27.2||29.6|\n|Finland||25.4||26.9|\n|France||-24.8||-36.8||9.5||7.6|\n|Germany||-23.6||51.3|\n|Greece||54.9|\n|Hungary||66.9||35.1||33|\n|Ireland||-13.4||-26||-18.8||-1.8|\n|Italy||23.3||20.6|\n|Latvia||-2.4||34.3|\n|Lithuania||26.8|\n|Poland||32.3||24.4||33|\n|Portugal||30.7||41.2||48.9||74.7||32.9|\n|Romania||57.3|\n|Slovakia||62.3|\n|Spain||-47.4||-43.2||79.5||53.5||28.3||74.3||22.5||47.5||7.7|\n|Sweden||31.5||72.2||35.4|\n|United Kingdom||14.7||14.5|\nSee the second tab of the dashboard: between 2000 and 2016, industrial, commercial and construction site sprawl caused the greatest productivity decline in Spain, followed by the Netherlands and France (47%), whereas urban residential sprawl impacted productivity the most in Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK (approximately 25%).\nAgricultural management and the conversion of land for agriculture increased productivity overall. The only exception was the conversion of pastures to non-irrigated arable land. This reduced productivity in France, Ireland and Germany (around 25% decline) \u2014 probably indicating the impact of drought on non-irrigated crops \u2014 although it increased productivity in Bulgaria and Romania. Converting pastures to arable lands and permanent crops resulted in a 96% productivity increase in Spain and converting forests to agriculture increased productivity in Portugal by 70% and in Spain by 18%. Converting arable lands to irrigation had a strong effect on productivity increase in Spain (80% increase) and Portugal (50%). These countries also led the conversion of semi-natural lands to agriculture, where productivity increased the most. Forest creation and afforestation had the highest impact on productivity in Portugal, followed by Germany and Poland (72% increase)."]}
