The monitoring data and other information regarding bathing water management are \nreported to the European Environment Agency by 30 reporting countries in Europe, to be assessed for the \nannual European report and more detailed national reports. \n \n \n\n1. BWD reporting in the season of 2020 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe bathing waters are quality classified according to the two microbiological parameters (Escherichia coli and \nIntestinal enterococci) defined in the Bathing Water Directive. All reported bathing waters (includes those that \ncould not be quality classified due to lack of samples) are in line with the minimum quality standards of the \nDirective, thus classified \u201csufficient\u201d or better. \n \n \n\nMore information at the national bathing water portal: \n\nhttps://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/environmental/Health-Inspectorate/WRAU/Pages/BathingWater-Programme.aspx \n\n  \n\nBathing waters in the season 2020 \n \n\nTotal reported 87 \nCoastal 87 \nInland 0 \n  \nFirst identified in 2020 0 \nDelisted in 2020 0 \n  \nTotal reported samples 1997 \n\n \n\nBathing water quality in the season of 2020 \n \n\nExcellent 84 (96.6%) \nGood 3 (3.4%) \nSufficient 0 (0%) \nPoor 0 (0%) \nNot classified 0 (0%) \n\n \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/europes-seas-and-coasts/assessments/state-of-bathing-water/bathing-water-directives\f\n \n\n2. BWD monitoring \n \nEach bathing water that is identified by the reporting country needs to have a monitoring calendar established \nbefore the bathing season. The monitoring calendar requirements can be summarised as follows: (1) a preseason sample is to be taken shortly before the start of each bathing season; (2) no fewer than four \n(alternatively, three for specific cases) samples are to be taken and analysed per bathing season; and (3) an \ninterval between sampling dates never exceeds one month. \n \nFrom the reported data, the assessment also designates effective implementation of the monitoring calendar \n(Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Bathing waters in 2020 according to implementation of the monitoring calendar \n\n Count Share of total [%] \n\nMonitoring calendar implemented \nA bathing water satisfies monitoring calendar conditions \nlisted above. \n\n87 100% \n\nMonitoring calendar not implemented \nA bathing water does not satisfy monitoring calendar \nconditions listed above. It may be quality-classified if \nenough samples are available in the last assessment \nperiod. \n\n0 0% \n\n \nIn addition to the monitoring calendar, management specifics of the last assessment period of four years are \nalso assessed. The status primarily indicates whether the complete dataset of four seasons is available, but \nalso points out the reasons as to why the bathing waters do not have the complete last assessment period \ndataset. The latter may indicate developing conditions at the site \u2013 most importantly, whether the bathing \nwater has been newly identified within the period, or any changes have occurred that are likely to affect the \nclassification of the bathing water. \n \nTable 2: Management specifics in the last assessment period of 2017\u20132020 \n\n Count Share of total [%] \n\nContinuously monitored \nA bathing water has been monitored in each bathing \nseason in the last assessment period. \n\n87 100% \n\nNewly identified \nA bathing water was identified for the first time within the \nlast assessment period.

Bathing water quality \n \n\n3.1 Coastal bathing waters \n\nCoastal bathing waters are situated on the sea or transitional water coastline, with respective parameter \nthresholds defined in Annex I of the Directive. They are subject to more strict thresholds than the inland \nbathing waters.
