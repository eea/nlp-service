The average CO2 emissions from new vans also increased slightly. Zero- and low-emission vehicles must be deployed much faster across Europe to achieve the stricter targets that apply from 2020.\nThe EEA has published the provisional data for the average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the UK in 2019. The provisional 2019 data on new registrations can be explored through a new EEA data dashboard.\nAfter a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km), average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017 and in 2018 (by 2.8 g CO2/km in total). According to provisional data, the upward trend continued with an additional increase of 1.6 g CO2/km in 2019, reaching 122.4 grams of CO2 per kilometre. This remains below the target of 130 g CO2/km that applied until 2019 but well above the EU target of 95 g CO2/km that phases-in this year.\nThe reasons for the increase in car emissions include the growing share of the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. The market penetration of electric cars remained slow in 2019.\nVans registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the UK in 2019 emitted on average 158.4 g CO2/km, which is 0.5 g/km more than in 2018. This remains well below the target of 175 g CO2/km that applied until 2019 but is still 11 g CO2/km higher than the EU target of 147 g CO2/km that applies from this year on. Several factors affected this emission increase, including an increase in the average mass and only a limited increase of the share of electric vans (BEV sand PHEV) from 0.8 % in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019.\nThe emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, with the objective to gradually replace the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. For compliance purpose, NEDC emissions values are used in 2019.\nThe EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger cars and vans registered in Europe, in accordance with EU Regulation (EU) No 2019/631.

The transport sector is responsible for about one third of the total CO2 emissions in the EU, and it has not seen the same reduction in emissions as other sectors.\nWhat the data are telling us\n- The latest provisional data show that average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in 2020 decreased significantly, after 3 years of consecutive increases. Following a steady decline until 2016, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in Europe increased between 2017 and 2019. Key reasons included the growth in the sport utility vehicle segment and an increase in average vehicle mass.\n- The reduction in CO2 emissions observed in 2020 was mostly due to a higher share of new registrations of electric vehicles in the fleet, up from 3.5 % in 2019 to 11 % in 2020. The share of sport utility vehicles in new car registrations continued to increase.\n- Petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, accounting for 58 % of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles accounted for 29 % of new registrations, including hybrid electric vehicles. The share of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (in the new fleet increased from 3.5 % to 11 %.\n- Following a steady decline between 2012 and 2017 then a slight increase between 2017 and 2019, average specific CO2 emissions from new van registrations decreased moderately in 2020 by 2.3 g CO2/km to 155.7 g CO2/km, based on provisional data. This decrease was, however, insufficient to meet the EU fleet-wide target of 147 g CO2/km, applicable since 2020.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic influenced the number of new vehicles registered in 2020: new registrations were 18 % lower than in 2019. In 2020, 1.36 million new vans were registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom.\n- Diesel vehicles accounted for 94 % of new registrations in 2020 and petrol vehicles for 2.5 %. However, sales of new battery-electric vehicles continued to increase slowly, reaching only about 2.2 % in 2020, compared with 1.4 % in 2019.\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, the European Parliament and the Council adopted regulations introducing mandatory CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles. Regulation (EU) No 2019/631 sets EU fleet-wide targets for average emissions of 95 g CO2/km for new passenger cars and 147 g CO2/km for new light commercial vehicles for the period after 2020. The EU fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030 are defined as a percentage reduction of the 2021 starting point. The regulation requires a 15 % reduction from 2025 and a 37.5 % reduction from 2030 onwards for new passenger cars, and a 15 % reduction from 2025 and a 31 % reduction from 2030 onwards for new light commercial vehicles.\nWhere the data come from\nAccording to the regulations, data on new registrations of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, including their CO2 emissions, are to be collected each year by Member States and submitted to the European Commission. Manufacturers can verify the data and notify the Commission of any errors identified in the data set. The Commission assesses the manufacturers\u2019 corrections, and, where justified, takes them into account in calculating their average CO2 emissions and specific emission targets.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.\nAccording to the EEA\u2019s provisional data, the average emissions of new passenger cars registered in the European Union (EU), Iceland, Norway, and the United Kingdom in 2020 were 107.8 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km). This was 14.5 g (12 %) lower than in 2019 and represented the first decrease observed since 2016. The share of electric vehicles in new registrations tripled from about 3.5 % in 2019 to about 11 % of new registrations in 2020.\nAbout 1.4 million new vans registered in Europe in 2020 with average emissions of 157.7 g CO2/km, which is 2.3 g (1.5 %) lower than in 2019. The share of electric vans increased from 1.4% in 2019 to about 2.3% in 2020.\nThe provisional data are available through the EEA\u2019s data viewer on CO2 emissions of new cars and new vans.\nThe emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures.

Electric car registrations for the year were close to 1,325,000 units, up from 550,000 units in 2019. This represents an increase from 3.5% to 11% of total new car registrations in just 1 year. The uptake of electric vans also increased, from 1.4% of total new registrations in 2019 to 2.2% in 2020. Battery electric vehicles, rather than plug-in hybrids, accounted for the majority of electric vehicle registrations in 2020 for cars and vans.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||Number of battery electric cars||Number of plug-in electric cars||Total vehicles||Share of electric cars in new registrations [%]|\n|2010||734||13181154||0.01|\n|2011||7759||12829535||0.06|\n|2012||13986||9000||12031054||0.19|\n|2013||24175||31167||11868737||0.47|\n|2014||37855||68180||12541978||0.85|\n|2015||56756||103553||13770826||1.16|\n|2016||64316||93707||14714327||1.07|\n|2017||97143||126898||15129296||1.48|\n|2018||148454||145898||14701753||2|\n|2019||341267||193316||15432388||3.46|\n|2020||720913||603314||11604630||11.41|\nThe transport sector is the largest contributor to EU greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, reducing transport emissions is key to meeting the EU\u2019s climate neutrality objectives.\nThe recently proposed legislation (Fit for 55) sets targets to cut CO2 emissions from cars by 55% and vans by 50% by 2030 (EU, 2021). It also proposes to completely cut emissions from cars and vans by 2035. A significant increase in the uptake of electric vehicles will be needed to achieve these goals.\nElectric cars \u2014 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) \u2014 are gradually penetrating the EU market. There has been a steady increase in the number of new electric car registrations annually, from 700 units in 2010 to about 550,000 units in 2019 (3.5% of new registrations). In 2020, electric car registrations surged, accounting for 11% of newly registered passenger cars.\nBEVs accounted for 6% of total new car registrations in 2020, while PHEVs represented 5%.\nThe average mass of a BEV increased from 1,200 kg in 2010 to 1,723 kg in 2019, while average energy consumption decreased from 264 kWh to 170 kWh, indicating that BEVs have become more efficient. PHEVs have become slightly heavier (increasing from 1,580 kg to 1,9300 kg between 2010 and 2020), but their energy consumption remained constant (i.e. around 170 kWh in 2020).\nIn 2020 almost 30,000 electric vans were sold, representing 2.2% of the market share and an increase of around 0.8 percentage points from 2019. The majority of electric vans sold were BEVs.\nNon plug-in hybrid electric vehicles represented 12% of new registrations in 2020, an 8 percentage point increase since 2019. These vehicles combine a conventional internal combustion engine with an electric propulsion system but are exclusively fuelled by conventional fuels. They are not included in the electric vehicle data presented.\nFurther growth in Europe\u2019s electric vehicle fleet could help the EU meet emissions reduction targets and ensure progress towards its 2050 objective of being climate neutral.\nIn 2020, the share of electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) in national new car registrations increased in all countries (EU-27, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom) compared with 2019. The highest shares were found in Norway (75%), Iceland (46%), Sweden (33%) and the Netherlands (28%).\nGermany, France and the United Kingdom accounted for about 60% of BEV registrations, with the numbers tripling compared with 2019. In Norway, BEVs accounted for 54% of new car sales in 2020, increasing from 30% in 2018. In some other European countries, however, the percentage of BEV registrations remained below 1% of the total fleet. PHEV sales were highest in Sweden (23%), and Norway and Iceland (20%).\nThe leading countries in electric mobility offer financial incentives such as tax reductions and exemptions for electric vehicles, designed to make the costs comparable to those of conventional vehicles. Other incentives, such as allowing the use of bus lanes, are also offered.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

For the first time, average CO2 emissions from new vans also increased in 2018. More efforts are needed from manufacturers to reduce vehicle CO2 emissions.\nAccording to the EEA report \u2018Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\u2019, emissions from new cars registered in the EU, the UK and Iceland in 2018 increased mainly due to the growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, in particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment, and the limited market uptake of zero\u2010 and low\u2010emission vehicles, including electric cars. The 2018 data on new registrations can be explored through a new EEA data dashboard.\nAfter a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 g CO2/km, average emissions from new cars increased by 0.4 g CO2/km in 2017 and by 2.3 g CO2/km in 2018 to reach 120.8 g CO2/km. While this is 7 % below the 2018 target of 130 g CO2/km, a considerable 27 % gap must still be filled to reach the target of 95 g CO2/km that applies from 2020 on.\nSimilarly, average emissions of new vans had decreased by 24 g CO2/km between 2012 and 2017, but increased from 156.1 g CO2/km in 2017 to 157.9 g CO2/km in 2018. While this is 10 % below the 2018 target of 175 g CO2/km, average emissions were still 7 % above the 2020 target.\nMany factors affected the increase in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, including an increase in the mass, engine capacity and size of the vehicles. The market share of petrol vans increased but remained limited, constituting 3.6 % of the new fleet (2.4% in 2017). The share of zero- and low-emission vans remained stable, at 1.7 % of the fleet.\nAll manufacturers, except one, met their specific CO2 emission targets in 2018 but were still far away from their 2020 targets. Automobili Lamborghini SPA exceeded its specific emission targets for 2018 and is therefore required to pay excess emission premiums. Amongst the large manufacturers, Toyota is the closest to reaching its future targets, with an estimated distance to the 2020 target of around 5 g CO2/km, while Mazda Corporations the furthest, with a distance to 2020 target of 39 g CO2/km.\nAll van manufacturers met their specific CO2 emission targets in 2018, taking into account pools and derogations. Some of the largest van makers, including Automobile Peugeot, Automobile Citroe\u0308n, Ford\u2010Werke GmbH and Iveco, have already achieved average specific CO2 emissions below their 2020 target level. Other manufacturers, including Nissan International, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Europe, are also very close to their 2020 targets.\nSince 2010, the officially reported average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars have decreased substantially. These reductions can be attributed to both the overall improvement of car energy efficiency, as well as a change in the mix of car models sold, towards more efficient powertrains and technologies. Engine downsizing and the uptake of electric vehicles have had a positive effect on reducing CO2 emissions but the growing share of SUVs has systematically led to an increase in emissions. The \u2018de-dieselisation\u2019 of the fleet has increased average emissions but its overall effect on each car manufacturer\u2019s performance depends on the fleet characteristic of the manufacturer.\nThe emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, gradually replacing the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. In 2018, Member States reported both NEDC and WLTP emission factors for around 4.4 million cars (around 30 % of new registrations). For those vehicles, the WLTP emission factor was on average 20 % higher than the NEDC emission factor.\nThe EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger cars and new vans registered in Europe, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 631/2019. The data reported by all EU Member States, the UK and Iceland in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle mass. The data reported by Iceland were included for the first time.\nIn 2020, the EEA will collect, also for the first time, data on CO2 emissions from heavy duty vehicles (trucks). These will be published in 2021.\n2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-cars-and-vans-sold or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:14 AM\nFiled under: co2 emissions cars and vans emissions\nFiled under: co2 emissions, cars and vans emissions\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "CO2 performance of new passenger cars in Europe\nFollowing a steady decline until 2016, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in Europe increased between 2017 and 2019.

The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, compared with 1990 levels, in order for the EU to become climate-neutral by 2050, while also working towards a zero-pollution ambition.\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, emission performance standards for new cars were introduced in 2009setting a fleet-wide target of 130 g CO2/km for the period 2015-2019 and 95 g CO2/km for the period 2020-2024, as well as specific CO2 emission targets for each manufacturer (or pool of manufacturers). In 2019, a new Regulationset new fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030, namely a 15% reduction from 2021 emission levels by 2025 and a 37.5% reduction by 2030.\nAfter a steady decline between 2010 and 2016, by almost 22 g CO2/km, average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017, 2018 and 2019, reaching 122.3 g CO2/km in 2019. Although this remains below the 2015-2019 target of 130 g CO2/km, it is well above the 2020-2024 target of 95 g CO2/km.\nThere are various reasons for the increase in emissions, for instance the growth in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment of the road transport sector. Almost 15.5 million new cars were registered in 2019 in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and about 38% of these were SUVs. SUVs are typically heavier than other cars and have more powerful engines and larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase fuel consumption. Most new SUVs registered were petrol vehicles, with average emissions of 134 g CO2/km, which is around 13 g CO2/km higher than other new petrol cars. Moreover, the average mass of new conventional cars, excluding SUV, increased by around 22 kg from 2018 to 2019.\nThe market penetration of electric cars remained low in 2019 and, as in 2018, petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, constituting 59% of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles constituted 31% of new registrations. Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles did continue to increase, however, reaching about 3.5% in 2019, compared with 2% in 2018. Non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are exclusively fuelled by conventional fuels, represented around 4% of new registrations. Registrations of electric vehicles, as a percentage of all newly registered cars, were highest in Norway (56%), Iceland (19%), the Netherlands (16%) and Sweden (12%). These countries were also among the few where the average emissions of new cars fell between 2018 and 2019.

Pools or individual manufacturers responsible for fewer than 300,000 newly registered cars may benefit from a derogation.\nIn 2019, almost all car manufacturers, either individually, or as members of pools or because of derogations, met their annual binding targets for newly registered passenger car fleets in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. Only four manufacturers, registering less than 13,000 vehicles a year, Automobili Lamborghini SPA, Bentley, Maserati and SsangYong, exceeded their emission targets.\nAmong the larger manufacturers, Toyota achieved the best CO2 performance, with average specific emissions of 108 g CO2/km, being closest to its 2020 objective.

The report is based on data \nreported by EU Member States (EU\u201128) and Iceland to \nthe European Environment Agency (EEA) and verified \nby\u00a0manufacturers\t(OEMs).\t\n\nFor passenger cars, Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 \n(EU,\u00a02009)\tsets\tan\tEU\tfleet\twide\tCO2 target of 130 gCO2 \nper kilometre (gCO2 /km) for the period 2015 to 2019.\n\nFor light commercial vehicles, Regulation (EU) \nNo\u00a0510/2011\t(EU,\t2011)\tsets\tan\tEU\tfleet\twide\tCO2 target \nof\u00a0175\tgCO2/km for the period 2017 to 2019. \n\nStarting from 2012 for cars and 2014 for vans, \na\u00a0binding\tspecific\temission\ttarget\thas\tapplied\tannually\t\nfor each manufacturer. The target is set according \nto the average mass of the manufacturer's newly \nregistered vehicles using a limit value curve. For \neach manufacturer, the average specific emissions \nof its fleet of newly registered vehicles in the EU that \nyear, are compared with the manufacturer's specific \nemission\u00a0target.\n\nStricter targets apply from 2020, as set out in the \nnew Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission \nperformance standards for new passenger cars and \nfor new light commercial vehicles, and repealing \nRegulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 \nfrom 1 January 2020. \n\nAverage CO2 emissions from new cars \nincreased\tby\tmore\tthan\t2\tg\u00a0CO2/km in 2018 \n\nCars\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the average CO2 \nemissions\u00a0(1) from new passenger cars increased \nin 2018 and reached 120.8 gCO2/km. After a steady \ndecline from 2010 to 2016 by almost 22 gCO2/km, \n\naverage emissions increased in 2017 by  \n0.4\u00a0gCO2/km. The upward trend continued with an \nadditional increase of 2.3 gCO2 /km in 2018. \n\nThe main factors contributing to that increase include \nthe growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, \nin particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. \nMoreover, the market penetration of zero\u2011 and \nlow\u2011emission vehicles, including electric cars, remained \nlow in 2018.\n\nVans\n\nFor the first time in 2018, average CO2\temissions\u00a0from\t\nnew\tlight\tcommercial\tvehicles\tregistered\tin\tthe\u00a0EU\u00a0were\t\nhigher\tthan\tin\tthe\tprevious\tyear:\t157.9\u00a0gCO2/km \nin\t2018\tagainst\t156.1\u00a0gCO2/km in 2017. Whereas \nbetween 2012\u20112017 average CO2 emissions decreased \nby\t24\u00a0gCO2/km, in 2018 emissions have increased by \nalmost\t2\u00a0gCO2/km compared to 2017.

The \nmarket share of petrol vehicles remains limited but \nhas\tincreased\tslightly,\tconstituting\t3.6\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tnew\t\nvans\tfleet\t(2.4%\tin\t2017).\tThe\tshare\tof\tzero-\tand\t\nlow-emission\tvans\tremained\tat\tthe\tsame\tlevel\t(1.7\u00a0%)\t\nas in 2017.\n\nThe vast majority of new registrations \nin\u00a02018\twere\tfor\tpetrol\tcars\t\n\nPetrol cars constituted the vast majority of new \nregistrations\t(around\t60\u00a0%),\twhile\tdiesel\tcars\taccounted\t\nfor\tmore\tthan\t36\t%,\tmarking\ta\tdrop\tof\t9\tpercentage\t\npoints from 2017, and 19 percentage points from the \npeak\tyear\t2011\t(55%).\tTogether,\tconventional\tdiesel\t\nand\tpetrol\tcars\taccounted\tfor\t96.5\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tnew\t\nregistrations.\n\nExecutive summary\n\n(1) Average CO2 emissions are calculated as simple averages without taking into account any adjustments.\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n8 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nThe average fuel efficiency of both diesel and petrol \ncars has worsened in the last year: diesel cars emitted \non\taverage\t121.8\u00a0gCO2/km (117.9 gCO2/km in 2017), \nwhile the average petrol car emitted 123.5 gCO2/km \n(121.6 gCO2/km in 2017). In 2000 the emission difference \nbetween diesel and petrol cars was much larger \n(17.1\u00a0gCO2/km). \n\nRising sales of SUV\n\nAn increase in sales of Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) was \nobserved in recent years. In Europe, one out of three \ncars newly registered in 2018 were SUVs. Compared \nto regular cars (as hatchback or sedan), SUVs are \ntypically heavier and have more powerful engines \nand larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase \nfuel\u00a0consumption.\n\nAccording to the dataset, the majority of new SUVs sold \nwere\tpowered\tby\tpetrol\t(53%),\twith\taverage\temissions\t\nof\t133\u00a0gCO2/km,\twhich\tis\taround\t14\u00a0gCO2/km higher \nthan the average emissions of other new petrol cars. \nForty\u2011five percent of SUVS were diesel vehicles with \naverage emissions of 129 gCO2/km, which is around \n13\u00a0gCO2/km higher than the average emissions of other \nnew diesel car.\n\nLow market penetration of electric \nvehicles \n\nThe proportion of plug\u2011in hybrid and battery electric \ncars\tdoubled\tfrom\t1.0\t%\tin\t2016\tto\t2.0\u00a0%\tin\t2018.\t\n\nThe CO2 emissions savings related to the deployment \nof electric vehicles have increased over the years, \nand reached 2.0 gCO2/km in 2018. This concerns both \nbattery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug\u2011in hybrid electric \nvehicles (PHEV).\n\nOne car manufacturer exceeded its \nspecific emission targets\n\nThe majority of car manufacturers met their specific \nCO2 emission targets in 2018 (Annex 3). Certain \nmanufacturers would have exceeded their specific \nemission target, but they met the target as part of \npools or because of derogations (see Annex 1). One \nmanufacturer, Automobili Lamborghini SPA, exceeded \nits specific emission targets and therefore is required to \npay excess emission premiums.\n\nAll van manufacturers met their CO2 specific emission \ntargets in 2018, taking into account pools and \nderogations.\n\nMore efforts are needed in order for \nmanufacturers to respect the 2020 targets\n\nBecause of the increase of the emissions in the last \ntwo years, in 2018 most car manufacturers were still \nfar away from meeting their 2020/2021 targets. Toyota \nis\u00a0the\tclosest\tto\treaching\tits\tfuture\ttargets,\tbut\tstill\thad\t\nto reduce its average emissions by around 5 gCO2/km \nby 2020. \n\nFor all other manufacturers the distance to the future \ntargets is higher, up to 39 gCO2/km in the case of \nMazda Corporation.\n\nSome of vans' manufacturers have already achieved \naverage CO2 specific emissions below their 2020 target: \nAutomobile Peugeot, Automobile Citro\u00ebn, Ford\u2011Werke \nGmbH and Iveco. Manufacturers such as Nissan \nInternational, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Europe \nare already very close to their 2020 targets; they still \nneed to reduce their average emissions by less than \n4\u00a0gCO2/km in the next 2 years. Other manufacturers \nwill have to make further progress to achieve their \n2020\u00a0targets.\n\nReducing the gap between type-approval \nand real world emissions \n\nFor both passenger cars and vans, the reported CO2 \nemissions are based upon measurements performed \nin the laboratory using a standard vehicle test cycle. \nOver the past decade, the gap between the laboratory \nemissions based on the NEDC test cycle and the \nreal\u2011world emissions has grown. This has led to the \ndevelopment of a new measurement protocol, the \nWorldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure \n(WLTP), which is more representative of real\u2011\nworld\u00a0driving.\n\nSince 2018, countries have reported both \nCO2\u00a0emissions\tbased\ton\tthe\told\t(NEDC)\tand\tnew\ttest\t\nprocedure (WLTP), the latter only for the newer models. \nUntil 2020, compliance with the CO2 emission targets \nwill continue to be based on NEDC emission values. \nFrom 2021 onwards, the compliance will be based on \nWLTP values. \n\nFrom 1 January 2021 onward, new vehicles sold in \nthe EU will be equipped with standardised on\u2011board \nfuel and/or energy consumption monitoring devices, \nwhich will monitor real\u2011world data. These data \nwill allow monitoring and assessing the real\u2011world \nrepresentativeness of emissions determined through \nthe test procedure for type approval.\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n9Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nThe improvements in manufacturers \nperformance were mostly driven by \ndownsizing and electric vehicles\n\nSince 2010, the officially reported CO2 emissions \nof new passenger cars have reduced substantially. \nThese reductions can be attributed to both the overall \nimprovement of car energy efficiency as well as a \nchange in the mix of car models sold in favour of more \nefficient powertrains/technologies. \n\nHowever, the downward trend of average CO2 \nemissions stopped in 2016 and these emissions have \nbeen increasing in the last two years. These trends \nwere mainly affected by the following drivers:\n\n\u2022 engine downsizing;\n\n\u2022 de\u2011dieselization; (shift to petrol) \n\n\u2022 introduction of new models;\n\n\u2022 electrification of the fleet;\n\n\u2022 increase in the market share of SUVs.\n\nWhile engine downsizing and the uptake of electric \nvehicles always have a positive effect on reducing CO2 \nemissions, the increase of SUVs has systematically led \nto an increase of emissions.\n\nUpgrading models, in case of complete overhaul of \nmodel (both engine and bodywork improvements) may \nreduce emissions. The effect of the de\u2011dieselisation \nof the fleet on average CO2 emissions depends on the \nfleet characteristic of the manufacturer.\n\nFigure ES.1  Average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and vans in the EU-28 and Iceland\n\n90\n\n0\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n170\n\n190\n\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n\nPassenger cars Vans Targets - passenger cars Targets - vans\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n10 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure ES.2  Distance to 2018 target by cars pool\n\nNote:  Bubble size represents the number of registrations.\n\nAverage mass (kg)\n\n0\n\n160\n\nAverage emissions  (gCO2/km)\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\n145\n\n150\n\n155\n\n1 0500 1 100 1 150 1 200 1 250 1 300 1 350 1 400 1 450 1 500 1 550 1 600 1 650 1 700 1 750 1 800 1 850 1 900 1 950 2 000 2 050\n\nLimit value curve 2018\n\nTATA MOTORS LTD, JAGUAR CARS LTD, LAND ROVER\n\nDAIMLER AG\n\nBMW GROUP\nFORD-WERKE GMBH\n\nVW GROUP PC\n\nMITSUBISHI MOTORS\n\nFCA ITALY SPA\n\nHYUNDAI\n\nKIA\n\nHONDA MOTOR EUROPE LTD\n\nSUZUKI POOL\n\nTOYOTA-MAZDA\nRENAULT\n\nPSA-OPEL\n\f\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\nMonitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from \nthe transport sector is a key priority for the EU.

Cars and light \ncommercial vehicles (vans) are responsible respectively \nfor\t44\t%\tand\t9\t%\tof\tthe\temissions\tof\tthe\ttransport\tsector.\n\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, \nthe European Parliament and the Council adopted two \nregulations, which introduced mandatory CO2 emission \nperformance standards for new passenger cars, and \nnew light commercial vehicles: \n\n\u2022 For new passenger cars, Regulation (EC) \nNo\u00a0443/2009\tsets\ta\ttarget\tof\t130\tgCO2/km for the \nEU fleet\u2011wide average CO2 emissions for the period \n2015 to 2019. A target of 95 gCO2/km has been set \nfor 2021 with a phase\u2011in starting in 2020.\n\n\u2022 For new light commercial vehicles, Regulation (EU) \nNo 510/2011 sets the target for the EU fleet\u2011wide \naverage CO2 emissions to 175 gCO2/km for the \nperiod 2017 to 2019. A target of 147 gCO2/km has \nbeen set for 2020.\n\nThese two Regulations have been replaced since \n1\u00a0January\t2020\ton\tby\tthe\tnew\tRegulation\t(EU)\t2019/631\t\n\n(EU, 2019) setting CO2 targets for new passenger cars \nand for new light commercial vehicles also for the \nperiod after 2020. The EU fleet\u2011wide targets for 2025 \nand 2030 are defined as a percentage reduction of the \n2021 starting point:\n\n\u2022 For new passenger cars, the Regulation requires \na\u00a015%\treduction\tfrom\t2025\ton\tand\ta\t37.5%\t\nreduction from 2030 on;\n\n\u2022 For new light commercial vehicles, the Regulation \nrequires\ta\t15%\treduction\tfrom\t2025\ton\tand\t\na\u00a031%\u00a0reduction\tfrom\t2030\ton.\n\nAccording to the Regulations, data on new registered \npassenger cars and vans, including their CO2 emissions, \nshall be collected each year by Member States and \nsubmitted to the European Commission. Manufacturers \ncan verify the data, and notify the Commission of any \nerrors. The Commission assesses the manufacturers' \ncorrections, and, where justified, takes them \ninto account for the calculation of their average \nCO2\u00a0emissions\tand\tspecific\temission\ttargets.\tThis\treport\t\npresents the data concerning the years 2010\u20112018. \n\nFor both cars and vans, the reported CO2 emissions \nare based upon the New European Driving Cycle \n(NEDC). Since 2018, countries have reported both \nCO2 emissions based on the old (NEDC) and new test \nprocedure (WLTP), the latter only for the newer models. \nFrom 2021, compliance assessment will be based on \nthe WLTP data.\n\n1 Introduction\n\n \nType approval emissions versus real-world emissions\n\nAccording to EU legislation, vehicles must be tested to verify that they comply with the required environmental, climate, \nsafety and security standards. To check that vehicles meet the official requirements for CO2 emissions, standardised \nmeasurements in laboratories are used. The results of these tests are the so\u2011called 'type approval' emissions.\n\nUntil September 2017, these tests were based on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Since then, the Worldwide \nHarmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) applies as the new type approval test procedure. The WLTP was developed \nto be more representative of real world driving conditions. From 2021 onwards, the WLTP will replace fully the NEDC for the \npurpose of the CO2 emission standards.\n\n(2)  All figures are calculated including emissions from international aviation and international shipping.\n\f\nMonitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 201812\n\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n2.1 Passenger cars\n\nThe final data presented in this report replace the \nprovisional data published by the EEA earlier in 2019, \ntaking into account corrections proposed by the \nmanufacturers. \n\nThe average CO2 emissions from the new passenger car \nfleet in the EU in 2018 were 120.8 gCO2/km (Figure\u00a02.1), \nwhich is an increase of 2.3 gCO2/km comparted to 2017.\n\nAfter a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost \n22\u00a0gCO2/km, average emissions from new passenger \ncars increased in 2017 by 0.4 gCO2/km. This upward \ntrend has continued in 2018 even though stricter \ntargets will start to apply from 2020 on.\n\nThe main factors contributing to the increase of \nnew passenger cars' emissions in 2018 include the \ngrowing\u00a0share\tof\tpetrol\tcars\tin\tnew\tregistrations\t\n(chapter 2.1.1), in particular in the sport utility \nvehicle\u00a0(SUV)\tsegment\t(chapter\t2.2.2).\tMoreover,\t\nthe\u00a0market\tpenetration\tof\tzero-\tand\tlow-emission\t\ncars,\u00a0including\telectric\tcars,\tremained\tlow\t\n(chapter\u00a02.2.1).\t\n\nIn order to identify the factors that have mostly \ninfluenced the increase in the CO2 average emissions \nover the last two years, the results of a simple \ndecomposition analysis is presented in Figure 2.2. \nThe\u00a0average\tCO2 average emissions of the two years is \ncalculated as the sum of the contributions coming from \ndifferent car segments (small, medium, large regular \n\n2 Average CO2 emissions from new \npassenger cars and vans\n\nFigure 2.1  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2/km) from new passenger cars, by fuel type (EU-28 and Iceland)\n\n50\n\n80\n\n110\n\n140\n\n170\n\n200\n\n230\n\nPetrol Diesel All fuels Targets\n\n130 gCO2/km\n\n95 gCO2/km\n\n0\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n13Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure 2.2  Decomposition analysis: average CO2 emissions changes observed for different car segments \n(small, medium, large regular cars and SUVs) (6) and fuel type (petrol and diesel). \n\n(3) The term 'regular cars' refers to passenger cars that are not SUV, as sedan or hatch back.\n(4) There is no universally accepted definition of the sport utility vehicle.

For example, \nin Portugal, Italy and Ireland, the share of diesel was \nhigher\tthan\t50%\t(Table 2.1), while in the Netherlands, \nFinland\tand\tHungary,\tthe\tshare\tis\tlower\tthan\t25\t%.\n\nEven if the vast majority of Europe's new cars remain \npowered by petrol or diesel, the registration of \nalternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) has been increasing over \nthe last two decades (Figure 2.4). This category included \nonly a few dual\u2011fuel cars in 2000, i.e. cars mostly able to \noperate on petrol and ethanol blends, but it exceeded \n\nhalf a million new vehicle registrations in 2009, due \nto scrappage schemes favouring the uptake of LPG \nand NG vehicles in Italy and France. In 2010/11 the \nregistrations\tof\tAFVs\tdecreased\tsignificantly\t(by\t62\t%),\t\ncaused mainly by the end of the scrappage schemes \nin\u00a0France\tand\tItaly.\n\nIn the recent years, the share of electric cars (both \nBEV and PHEV) has been growing quickly. In 2018, \nthere were almost 150 000 registrations of BEVs \nand\t150\u00a0000\u00a0registrations\tof\tPHEVs.\tTogether,\tthey\t\nrepresented\t2\t%\tof\tnew\tregistrations.\t\n\nFigure 2.5 shows the average CO2 emissions including \nand excluding electric cars (BEV and PHEV).

With the new system (called Klimatbonus), buyers of passenger cars newly registered from \n1 July 2018 and with CO2\u00a0emissions\tlower\tthan\t60\tgCO2/km will receive a bonus depending on their CO2 emission. For \nbattery electric vehicles (BEV), the bonus is 60 000 SEK and for plug\u2011in hybrid (PHEV) with CO2\u2011emission of 60g/km the \nbonus\tis\t10\t000\tSEK.\tFor\tPHEV\temitting\tless\tthan\t60\u00a0gCO2/km, the 60 000 SEK bonus decreases by 833 SEK per g/km \nemitted.\n\n\u2022 Road tax: the annual road tax is calculated according to the CO2\u2011emission of the vehicle. The low\u2011emitting cars are \nexempt from the road tax for the first five years after registration.\n\n\u2022 Company cars: the private use of company cars in Sweden can be declared as a 'benefit in kind' in the tax declaration \nif the vehicle is electric. And therefore this reduces the amount of income taxes that needs to be paid on it. In \nNovember\u00a02017,\tcompany\tcars\taccounted\tfor\tapproximately\t70%\tof\tthe\tnew\telectric\tcar\tsales.\n\n\u2022 Other incentive as implementation of support scheme for private charging infrastructure. The Swedish government \nimposed as well the adoption of environment\u2011friendly and electric cars in government fleets\n\n(7) Tail\u2011pipe emissions are the exhaust emissions of the vehicles. There are no end\u2011of\u2011pipe emissions for BEVs and low end of pipe emissions for \nPHEVs However, BEVs and PHEVs produce indirect emissions when they are plugged into the electricity grid. The indirect emissions are not \ntaken into account in this report or in the regulation.\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n18 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nsame period. Figure 2.6, shows that diesel cars are \non average about 300 kg heavier than their petrol \ncounterparts.\n\nVehicle mass is a critical parameter in car design as it \nis linked closely to fuel consumption. Increasing the \nmass of the car leads to a rise in the energy needed \nto accelerate the car and an increase in the rolling \nresistance resulting in increased energy consumption \n(and thus, all other aspects remaining unchanged, \nCO2\u00a0emissions).\tIn\torder\tto\texamine\tthe\tquantitative\t\neffect of weight, several studies have been carried out \nwhich demonstrate that for an additional vehicle mass \nof 50 \u2013 200 kg, the increase of fuel consumption over \nvarious cycles and operating conditions ranges from \n5\u00a0to\t9%\t(Fontaras,\tet\tal.,\t2017).\n\nLooking at the engine power trend, a substantial \nincrease from 2011 to 2018 is observed (Figure 2.7). \nOn\u00a0average,\tpetrol\tand\tdiesel\tcars\tare\tabout\t17.5%\tand\t\n11.5%\trespectively\tmore\tpowerful\tin\t2018\tthan\tthey\t\nwere in 2011. In addition, it is worth stressing that the \nconventional diesel cars are generally more powerful \nthan petrol counterparts.\n\nAs discussed previously, the automotive industry \nhas been able to reduce CO2 emissions from new \n\npassenger cars and meet the 130g CO2/km target, \neven when delivering more powerful passenger cars \nto the market. One factor that helped this decoupling \nof emissions from engine power was the petrol engine \ndownsizing that has taken place in recent years. Engine \ndownsizing can be defined as the use of a smaller \nengine able to deliver the power of a larger engine by \napply technologies increasing the engine's efficiency, \nsuch as supercharging or turbocharging (see chapter 5).\n\nDiesel and petrol cars exhibit different trends as \nregards engine capacity. In general, the average engine \ncapacity of diesel remained stable during the eight\u2011year \nperiod (2010\u20112018), slightly above 1800 cc, whereas \nthe average engine capacity of petrol cars decreased \nby 90 cc over the same period.

In fact, in comparison with other \ncars within a given segment, SUVs have larger frontal \nareas and higher drag coefficients that have a negative \nimpact on fuel consumption and can weaken efforts to \nreduce CO2 emissions. \n\nIn the database, SUVs were identified using the \ncommercial name. The remaining vehicles were then \nclassified according to the segment definition in \nAnnex\u00a02.\n\nAccording to EEA analysis, the majority of new SUVs \nsold\twere\tpowered\tby\tpetrol\t(53%),\twith\taverage\t\nemissions\tof\t133\u00a0gCO2/km,\twhich\tis\t14\u00a0gCO2/km higher \nthan the average emissions of other new petrol cars. \nForty\u2011five percent of SUVs were diesel cars with average \n\nemissions of 129 gCO2/km, which is 13 gCO2/km higher \nthan the average emissions of other new diesel cars.\n\n2.2 Vans\n\nSince the start of the monitoring, and for the sixth \nyear in a row, the number of new van registrations has \nincreased (Annex 2). In 2018, 1.65 million new vans \nwere\tregistered\tin\tthe\tEU-28\tand\tIceland,\t2.6\t%\tmore\t\nthan in 2017. \n\nThose vans emitted on average 157.9 gCO2/km, which \nis 1.7 gCO2/km more than in 2017. Following a sharp \ndecrease in 2017, this is the first increase in average \nCO2 emissions from new vans since the Regulation \ncame into force in 2011. Many factors affected the \nincrease in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, \nincluding an increase in the mass, engine capacity and \nsize of the vehicle. The market share of petrol vans \nremained very remains limited but increased slightly \n\nFigure 2.9  SUVs market share for 2007-2018 \n\nNote:  2007\u20112016 data from JATO (JATO, 2019b) , 2017\u20112018 EEA dataset.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nNumber of SUVs (%)\n\nSmall Medium SUV Large\n\nDiesel 102.6 113.9 129.1 143.7\n\nPetrol 113.3 126.2 133.1 203.9\n\nTable 2.3  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2/km) by segment and fuel type\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n21Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nto\u00a03.5\t%\t(from\t2.4%\tin\t2017).\tThe\tshare\tof\tzero-\tand\t\nlow-emission\tvans\tremained\tat\tthe\tsame\tlevel\t(1.7\t%)\t\nas in 2017. \n\nThe average CO2 emissions from vans increased \nbetween 2017 and 2018 in all countries, but six. \nThe\tdecrease\tvaried\tfrom\t0.3\u00a0gCO2/km in Ireland to \n5.9\u00a0gCO2/km in Romania, while the increases varied \nfrom 0.1 gCO2/km in Croatia to 10.4 gCO2/km in Latvia. \nNo major changes were observed in fleet composition \nor average mass in these countries.\n\nAll countries had average specific CO2 emissions from \nnewly registered vans in 2018 below 175 gCO2/km, \nwhich is the EU target since 2017 (Figure 5.3).

It has become mandatory for all new \npassenger cars since September 2018 and for all new \nvans from September 2019.\n\nCompared to the NEDC, WLTP is more representative \nof real driving conditions. The new test includes \na\u00a0greater\trange\tof\tdriving\tsituations,\tmore\tdynamic\t\nand\u00a0representative\taccelerations\tand\tdecelerations,\t\nmore realistic driving behaviour more realistic vehicle \ntest mass, and stricter test conditions that better \nrepresent real\u2011world driving conditions (EEA 2016). \n\nThe average CO2 emissions and the targets until \n2020 will be calculated using the NEDC values.

Five large manufacturers (10) were analysed, \ntaking into account aspects such as average yearly \nreported CO2\u00a0emissions,\ttotal\tnew\tregistrations\tin\tthe\t\nEU, the uptake of low or zero emission vehicles and \ntechnological developments.\n\nThe main technologies and fleet\u2011wide trends identified \nin the passenger car sector in the recent past which \nmay have influenced CO2 emissions either positively \nor\u00a0negatively\tare\tthe\tfollowing:\n\n\u2022 downsizing;\n\n\u2022 de\u2011dieselization; \n\n\u2022 introduction of new models;\n\n\u2022 electrification;\n\n\u2022 SUVs market.\n\n5.1 Downsizing \n\nOne of the most important strategies followed by \nmanufacturers to comply with the CO2 emission \n\n5 Factors affecting the performance of \ncars\u00a0manufacturers\n\nregulations was the replacement of bigger engines with \ncompact ones or, in other words, engine downsizing. \nThese compact engines provide the needed power, \nwhile reducing, at the same time, the fuel consumption \n(Patil, et al., 2017). \n\nThe increased performance in a downsized engine \nis achieved by adding a forced aspiration device \n(turbocharger or supercharger) accompanied by other \nengine technologies such as direct injection technology \nor variable valve timing (VVT). The major advantages \nof a direct injection engine are increased fuel \nefficiency and high\u2011power output. VVT is the process \nof\u00a0optimising\tthe\ttiming\tof\ta\tvalve\tlift\tevent,\tand\tis\t\noften used to improve performance, fuel economy \nand\u00a0to\treduce\temissions.\n\nAs a cost\u2011effective technique, engine downsizing \nhas been implemented by the majority of cars \nmanufactures\t(Leduc,\u00a0et\tal.,\t2003;\tTartakovsky,\tand\t\nGutman, 2012).\n\nTo examine how the engine downsizing has influenced \npassenger cars over the years, the example of Ford is \npresented in Figure 5.1.\n\nFord relied heavily on the downsizing of the engines, \nespecially for petrol cars. In fact, the average engine \ncapacity\tdecreased\tby\t17\t%\tbetween\t2010-2018,\twhile\t\naverage\tengine\tpower\tincreased\tby\t28\t%\tcompared\tto\t\n2011 levels. This downsizing effect largely contributed \nto the reduction of the average CO2 emissions, up until \n2015\t(by\t16\t%\tcompared\tto\t2010\tdata).\t\n\n5.2 De-dieselisation \n\nIn general, diesel cars emit less CO2 than equivalent \npetrol cars with similar characteristics. Therefore, \nsupported by policies in many Member States, diesel \nvehicles have dominated the EU market reaching a \n55\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\tshare\tin\t2011.\tBy\t2015,\tdespite\ta\tsmall\t\ndrop\tin\tthe\tshare\tof\tdiesel\tcars\t(52\u00a0%),\tthey\tremained\t\n\n(9)  2018 data used for the analysis are provisional data.\n(10)  Volkswagen (VW), Toyota, BMW Group, Ford Group and Renault.\n\f\nFactors affecting the performance of cars manufacturers\n\n35Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nthe predominant choice of EU consumers. Since \nSeptember 2015, following the 'Diesel scandal', the \nshare of diesel cars started to drop, and this trend was \nstronger in the last two years, with the diesel car share \nin\tthe\tnew\tfleet\treaching\tabout\t36\t%\tin\t2018.\tInstead,\t\npetrol vehicles are now dominating the new car market. \n\nThis shift from diesel to petrol cars is one of the \nreasons why the average CO2 emissions in the EU \nhave\u00a0increased\tin\t2017\tand\t2018.\n\nTo examine how de\u2011dieselisation has influenced \npassenger cars over the years, the BMW example \nis\u00a0presented\tin\tFigure 5.2.\n\nFor both diesel and petrol cars, BMW has, compared to \nthe other large car manufacturers, one of the highest \naverage mass, engine capacity and engine power by \na sizable margin. This is expected as BMW historically \nproduces larger, more luxurious, and high\u2011performance \ncars (such as the X series) rather than smaller cars. \nAs\u00a0effect,\ttheir\taverage\tCO2 emissions is one of the \nhighest among the larger cars manufactures, during \nthe\u00a0period\t2010-2018.\n\nThe average CO2 emissions decreased significantly \n(almost\t15\u00a0%)\tfrom\t2010\tto\t2017.\tFor\tthe\tlarger\tpart,\t\nthis can be directly attributed to powertrain efficiency \nand vehicle design improvements, most notably smaller, \nturbocharged, more efficient engines (downsizing). \n\nNevertheless, in 2018 there was an increase in the \naverage\temissions,\tby\talmost\t5\u00a0%,\tcompared\tto\t2017.\t\nThis is mainly related to the increased share of petrol \ncars: compared to 2017, in 2018, BMW diesel new \nregistrations\tdecreased\tby\tabout\t20\u00a0%\twhile\tpetrol\tnew\t\nregistrations\tincreased\tby\tabout\t27\u00a0%,\trepresenting\t\n45\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tfleet\tin\t2018\t(35\t%\tin\t2017).\tOn\taverage,\t\nBMW petrol cars emit 8 gCO2/km more than diesel cars.\n\nEven if it is true that, in general, a diesel car emits \nless than an equivalent petrol version, the effect \nof dieselisation on cars manufacturers depends as \nwell on the type of petrol and diesel cars that the \nmanufacturer\u00a0produces.\t\n\nAlthough one would expect that the decline in diesel \nshare would negatively affect the overall CO2 emissions, \nthis is not the case for Volkswagen.

In 2018, diesel cars are \n24\t%\theavier\tand\thave\t48\t%\tbigger\tengine\tcapacity,\t\ncompared to their petrol counterparts, resulting in \nhigher average CO2 emissions. Hence, the smaller \ndiesel share of new sales has a positive effect on the \noverall average CO2 emissions.\n\n5.3 Upgrades to the most sold models in \nrecent year\n\nThe study looked into the most sold vehicles for the \n5\u00a0manufacturers\tanalysed.\t\n\nAs example, Renault Clio is the most sold Renault car. \nIt\taccounted\tfor\tover\t2\u00a0%\tof\tall\tnew\tpassenger\tcar\tsales\t\nin the EU in 2017 (ICCT, 2018). In 2013, the introduction \nof the new Renault IV model led to a noticeable drop \nin average CO2\temissions\t(10\t%)\t(Figure 5.4). The \nRenault Clio IV was equipped with a new generation of \ndownsized petrol engines (such as the Energy TCe 90) \nand diesel engines (such as the Energy dCI 90), which \nwere introduced around the same time period and \nwere designed to offer better fuel efficiency.\n\nAfter 2014, the CO2 emissions of the petrol version \nstabilized, while the emissions of the diesel version \nslightly decreased until 2016 then rising in the last \ntwo years to the same level of 2013. This may be due \nto their increasing average mass, as average engine \ncapacity remained constant throughout the years. \n\n5.4 Penetration of electric vehicles \n\nElectrified cars are gradually increasing their share in \nnew passenger car sales nowadays. This is triggered \nin particular by the need to reduce emissions of \nCO2\u00a0and,\tparticularly\tin\turban\tareas,\tair\tpollutants\tsuch\t\nas NOx\u00a0and\tPM.\tIn\tthe\tETC\treport,\tHEV\thave\tbeen\tas\t\nwell\u00a0identified\tand\tincluded\tin\tthe\tanalysis\t\n\nMore than other manufacturers, Toyota moved away \nfrom conventional cars, especially diesel, and promoted \nmore hybridised powertrains. As a matter of fact \nToyota announced its plans to completely phase out \ndiesel cars by the end of 2018, due to limited demand \nand widespread uptake of hybrid alternatives (HEV) \n(Toyota, 2018).\n\nIn 2018 despite the abrupt rise in CO2 emissions of \ndiesel cars, the overall CO2 emissions are significantly \nlower\tthan\tin\t2010\t(-\t20\t%).\tThis\tis\trelated\tto\tthe\tfact\t\nthat\tthe\tdiesel\tshare\tis\trather\tsmall\t(5\t%)\tand\tthe\tHEV\t\nregistrations, with an average emissions of 93 gCO2/km, \n\nFigure 5.4  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2 /km) of Renault Clio \n\nPetrol Diesel Total conventional\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013\n\nOctober 2012:\nIntroduction\nof new Clio IV\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n140\n\n130\n\n110\n\n120\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\f\nFactors affecting the performance of cars manufacturers\n\n38 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nrepresents\tmore\tthan\t56\t%\tof\tthe\tnew\tregistrations\tin\t\n2018 (Figure 5.5).\n\n5.5 Increase in sport utility vehicle sales \noffsets technological improvement\n\nManufacturers are heavily promoting new SUV and \nso\u2011called crossover models, available in a range of \nsizes and power output. As a result, the share of SUV \nsurged in recent years, as illustrated in Figure 5.6. This \ntendency is closely related to the increase in average \nmass, in the 2015\u20112018 timeframe, which applies to all \nselected manufacturers. \n\nBecause SUVs are typically larger, heavier and less \naerodynamic than medium sized passenger cars, they \nconsume more fuel and hence they emit more CO2. \nOne may argue that the surge in SUV demand is, at \nleast partially, cancelling out the environmental benefit \n\nfrom CO2 reduction technologies already employed in \nmodern cars, as well as the benefit from the increasing \nmarket share of the so\u2011called zero and low\u2011emission \npassenger cars (i.e. HEV, PHEV, BEV).\n\nAs an example, the average CO2 emissions of \nVolkswagen SUVs (Figure 5.7) follow a downward trend \n(20\u00a0%\treduction\tsince\t2010).\tNevertheless,\tin\tabsolute\t\nnumbers the average emissions (135 gCO2/km in \n2018) remain higher than small and medium sized \ncars (Figure\u00a05.3). This downward trend is related to the \ntechnological development in modern powertrains and \nvehicle design. In more recent years, this trend can be \nalso attributed to the introduction of smaller (both in \nvehicle and engine size) and more aerodynamically \nefficient SUV (often characterized as Crossovers). \nExamples of such models are the newer T\u2011Roc and \nT\u2011Cross models, compared to the bulkier Tuareg and \nTiguan models.\n\nFigure 5.5  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2/km) by fuel for Toyota \n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n95\n\n85\n\n105\n\n115\n\n125\n\n135\n\n145\n\nNumber of vehicles (thousand)\n\n0\n\n155\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\n450\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nEVs registrations Petrol Diesel EVsAll\n\f\nFactors affecting the performance of cars manufacturers\n\n39Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure 5.6:  Market share of new SUV compared to total new registrations (2018)\n\nNumber of SUV (%)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nVW Toyota BMW Ford Renault\n\n0\n\nFigure 5.7  Volkswagen SUVs: Average CO2 emissions by fuels (gCO2/km)\n\n140\n\n130\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nNumber of vehicles (thousand)\n\n0\n\n180\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\n450\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSUVs registrations Petrol Diesel All\n\f\nMonitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 201840\n\nReferences\n\nEEA, 2016, Explaining road transport emissions \u2014 \na\u00a0non\u2011technical guide, European Environment Agency \n(https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/explaining\u2011\nroad\u2011transport\u2011emissions).\n\nEU, 2009, Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting \nemission performance standards for new passenger \ncars as part of the Community's integrated approach \nto reduce CO2 emissions from light\u2011duty vehicles, \nOJ\u00a0L\u00a0140,\t5.6.2009,\tp.\t1-15.\n\nEEA, 2018, Appropriate taxes and incentives do affect \npurchases of new cars, EEA Briefing, European \nEnvironment Agency (https://www.eea.europa.eu/\nthemes/transport/vehicles\u2011taxation/appropriate\u2011taxes\u2011\nand incentives\u2011do).\n\nEU, 2011, Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting \nemission performance standards for new light \ncommercial vehicles as part of the Union's integrated \napproach to reduce CO2 emissions from light\u2011duty \nvehicles, OJ L 145, 31.5.2011, pp. 1\u201118.\n\nEU, 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 setting \nCO2 emission performance standards for new \npassenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles, \nand repealing Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) \nNo 510/2011.\n\nFontaras, G., Zacharof, N. and Cuiffo, B., 2017, 'Fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions from passenger cars \nin Europe \u2014 Laboratory versus real\u2011world emissions', \nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 60, 97\u2011131.\n\nReferences\n\nICCT, 2018, European vehicle market statistics, \npocketbook 2017/2018, International Council on \nClean Transportation, Berlin, Germany (https://\ntheicct.org/publications/european\u2011vehicle\u2011market\u2011\nstatistics\u201120172018) accessed 26 September 2018.\n\nJATO, 2019a, 'Global SUV boom continues in 2018 but \ngrowth moderates' (https://www.jato.com/global\u2011suv\u2011\nboom\u2011continues\u2011in\u20112018\u2011but\u2011growth\u2011moderates/) \naccessed 27 November 2019.\n\nJATO, 2019b, 'Global SUV boom continues in 2018 but \ngrowth moderates'.\n\nJRC, 2018, 'CO2MPAS: Vehicle simulator predicting \nNEDC CO2 emissions from WLTP \u2014 CO2MPAS 2.0.0+9.\ng5b3144d documentation' (https://co2mpas.io/) \naccessed 26 September 2018.\n\nLeduc, P., Dubar, B., Ranini, A. and Monnier, G., 2003, \n'Downsizing of gasoline engine: An efficient way to \nreduce CO2 emissions'.\n\nPatil, C., Varade, S. and Wadkar, S., 2017, 'A review of \nengine downsizing and its effects', International Journal \nof Current Engineering and Technology Special Issue 7, \npp. 319\u2011324.\n\nTartakovsky, L. and Gutman, M., 2012, Energy efficiency \nof road vehicles \u2011 trends and challenges, E.F.

The notification \nmust be submitted within 3 months from the \nnotification of the provisional calculations.\n\nAs it does for countries' data, the EEA performs several \nquality checks to evaluate the accuracy and the quality \nof the data that have been corrected in the notification \nof errors. The verification process is very similar to the \none performed for countries' data presented in the \nprevious paragraphs. After this additional quality check, \nthe database is finalised.\n\nBased on the final data, the EEA calculates the \nperformance of car and van manufacturers in meeting \ntheir CO2 emission targets. The performance is \ncalculated as the difference between the average CO2 \nspecific emissions and the specific emission target for \neach manufacturer. The Commission notifies each \nmanufacturer (and pool) of the final calculations and \nthe provisional data are published on the EEA website.\n\nCalculation of average CO2 specific \nemissions\n\nAverage specific CO2 emissions are calculated as a \nweighted average of the manufacturer's fleet registered \nin a particular year. The average specific emissions for \neach manufacturer are subsequently adjusted to take \ninto account the following modalities (summarised in \nTable A1. 1):\n\n\u2022 phase\u2011in;\n\n\u2022 super\u2011credits;\n\n\u2022 eco\u2011innovations.\n\nPhase-in\n\nA phase\u2011in provision applies for calculating the average \nspecific emissions for cars in 2020: for assessing \ncompliance against the specific emission targets in \nthat\tyear,\tonly\tthe\t95\u00a0%\tbest-performing\tcars\tof\teach\t\nmanufacturer or pool will be taken into account.

These vehicles \nare temporarily given a greater weight when calculating \nthe average specific emissions of a manufacturer, as \nfollows: each such car is counted as 2 cars in 2020, \n1.67\u00a0cars\tin\t2021\tand\t1.33\tcars\tin\t2022.\tOver\tthe\tperiod\t\n2020-2022,\tthe\u00a0use\tof\tsuper-credits\twill\tbe\tsubject\tto\t\na\u00a0cap\tof\t7.5\u00a0gCO2/km for each manufacturer. For vans, \nno super\u2011credit scheme exists from 2018 on.\n\nEco-innovations\n\nFor certain innovative technologies which produce \nreal\u2011world CO2 savings, those cannot be demonstrated \nunder the applicable type\u2011approval test procedure. \nTo support technical development, a manufacturer \nor supplier can apply to the Commission for the \napproval of such innovative technologies. The approval \nconditions are set out in Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 \nfor cars and Regulation (EU) No 427/2014 for vans. \nIf\u00a0a\u00a0manufacturer\tfits\tits\tvehicle\t(car\tor\tvans)\tfleet\twith\t\nan approved eco\u2011innovation, the average emissions \nof\u00a0that\u00a0manufacturer\tmay\tbe\treduced\tby\ta\tmaximum\t\nof\u00a07\u00a0gCO2/km. \n\nCalculation of specific emission targets\n\nFor each manufacturer annual specific emissions target \nis defined, calculated on the basis of the fleet\u2011wide \ntarget\tand\tthe\taverage\t'mass\tin\trunning\torder'\u00a0(17) \nof\u00a0the\tregistered\tvehicles.\t\n\n(16) In addition to VINs, manufacturers may submit detailed monitoring data for the vehicles registered.\n(17) According to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, mass in running order means the mass of the car with bodywork, coolant, oils, fuel, spare wheel, \n\ntools and driver as stated in the certificate of conformity and defined in Section 2.6 of Annex I to Directive 2007/46/EC.\n\f\nAnnex 1\n\n43Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nThe following formulae applied for calculating the \nspecific emission targets for passenger cars (1) and \nvans (2) until 2019 (included):\n\nPassenger\tcars:\t130\u00a0+\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M0) (1)\n\nVans:\t175\u00a0+\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M0) (2)\n\nwhere:\n\nM is the average mass of the manufacturer's fleet \nin\u00a0kilograms;\n\nM0\tis\tthe\treference\tmass\t(1\u00a0392.4\u00a0kg);\n\na is 0.0457 for passenger cars and 0.093 for vans.\n\nThis means that, for example, if the average mass \nof a manufacturer's newly registered passenger car \nfleet\tin\ta\tgiven\tyear\tis\t1\u00a0392.4\u00a0kg,\tthe\ttarget\tfor\tthat\t\nmanufacturer\tis\t130.0\u00a0gCO2/km.\n\nIf the average mass of the newly registered passenger \ncar\tfleet\tis\t1\u00a0492.4\u00a0kg,\tthe\ttarget\tfor\tthat\tmanufacturer\t\nis\t134.57\u00a0gCO2/km.

The pools are \nlisted in Annex 4. \n\nDerogations\n\nFor passenger cars, manufacturers selling fewer than \n10\u00a0000\tvehicles\tper\tyear\tcan\tapply\tfor\ta\tsmall-volume\t\nderogation. In this case, a specific emission target \ncan be granted consistent with the manufacturer's \neconomic and technological potential to reduce specific \nCO2 emissions. \n\nNiche derogations are provided for manufacturers \nresponsible\tfor\tbetween\t10\u00a0000\tand\t300\u00a0000\tnew\tcar\t\nregistrations.

For a WLTP interpolation family \ntwo parameters are defined in this respect:\n\n\u2022 deviation factor, De: it is the relative difference \nbetween the result of a random physical test to \nbe performed by a selection of vehicles and the \nmanufacturer declared value;\n\n\u2022 verification factor, Vf: When performing physical \ntests the correctness of the correlation input data \nshould be verified.

Small cars constitute most of the sales, \nfollowed by medium\u2011sized cars. Large cars constitute \nonly\ta\tminor\tshare,\tin\tthe\torder\tof\t4\u00a0%.\tOver\tthe\tperiod\t\n2010\u20112015, small cars have significantly strengthened \ntheir\tshare:\twhereas\tin\t2010\tthey\trepresented\t68\u00a0%\t\nof the market, in 2015 they increased their share by \n9\u00a0percentage\tpoints,\tconstituting\t77\u00a0%\tof\tall\tpetrol\tcars.\t\nIn the last 3 years, however, the percentage of small \ncars\thas\tsignificantly\tdecreased\tto\tthe\t2010\tlevel\t(67\u00a0%)\t\nin favour of medium and large cars.\n\nAs for diesel cars (Figure A2.2), the highest share of the \nmarket belongs to medium cars. Small and large cars \nhold minor shares. The trend observed in recent years \nis that the share of mid\u2011range cars has grown mainly at \nthe expense of small size cars.\n\nFigure A2.1 Market share per segment for petrol passenger cars\n\nSegment share (%)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n68 69 71 73 76 77 76 74\n67\n\n28 28 27 24 22 21 21 23\n30\n\n4 3 3 2 2 2 3 3 4\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nPetrol - small Petrol - medium Petrol - large\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n46 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nAs expected, larger cars generally had higher \nCO2\u00a0emissions\t(Figure A2.3 and Figure A2.4). However, \na decreasing trend in CO2 emissions is observed for all \nsegments. The CO2 emissions reductions are highest \nfor\u00a0larger\tcars\tand\trather\tmarginal\tfor\tsmaller\tones.\t\n\nRemarkable is the difference in the CO2 emissions of \nthe large size between petrol and diesel conventional \ncars. Specifically, Large\u2011petrol had extra emissions of \nup to 68 g/km compared to Large\u2011diesel. Though, their \ndifference has fallen towards the end of the time series \nto 52.4 gCO2/km in 2017.\n\nFor diesel cars segment an increase of emissions is \nobserved between 2018 and 2017from 0.2 gCO2/km  \nfor the small size car to almost 7 gCO2/km for the big \nones. For conventional petrol cars, large saw a small \nreduction in CO2\temissions\tof\taround\t2\u00a0gCO2/km,  \nmedium and small cars slightly increased their \nCO2\u00a0emissions\tby\tabout\t0.5\u00a0and\t1.0\tgCO2/km, \nrespectively, in the last year.\n\nThe peculiar behaviour of mini\u2011petrol cars, which \nfor several years had higher CO2 emissions than \nsmall\u2011petrol cars, is attributed to the fact that mini \ncars recorded a very small market share, which was \nnegligible towards the end of the time series.\n\nAlmost all size categories have seen an increase in the \nmass of the car since 2010, except large\u2011diesel cars, for \nwhich\tthe\tmass\thad\treduced\tby\tabout\t10\u00a0kg\tin\t2018\t\ncompared with 2010 ( Figure A2.5 and Figure A2.6). \nHowever, it should be noted that the changes in mass \nwere generally quite mild (from 40 kg to 100kg for the \nperiod 2010\u20112018), with the most intense occurring in \nthe small segment, in which the mass of petrol cars \nincreased\tby\t6\u00a0%\tand\tthe\tmass\tof\tdiesel\tcars\tincreased\t\nby\t8.5\u00a0%\tin\tthe\tperiod\t2010-2018.\n\nCars have become more powerful over the past 8 years, \nand this applies to all size classes and to both petrol and \ndiesel engines (Figure A2.7 and Figure A2.8). The large \npetrol cars sold were much more powerful than the \nlarge diesel ones.\n\nRegarding the other size categories (medium and \nsmall), petrol powertrains are slightly more powerful \nthan the corresponding diesel ones. This is because in \nsimilar engine sizes, a petrol engine will have greater \npower than a diesel engine because it can run at higher \nrotational speeds and power is directly proportional to \nthe speed. However, at lower speeds a diesel engine \ncan produce higher torque than a petrol engine.\n\nFigure A2.2 Market share per segment for diesel passenger cars\n\n11 11 9 7 6 4 4 3 2\n\n75 75 77 78 79 81 83 84 86\n\n14 14 14 15 15 15 13 13 12\n\nSegment share (%)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nDiesel - small Diesel - medium Diesel - large\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n47Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure A2.3 Trends in CO2 emissions of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n250\n\n225\n\n200\n\n175\n\n125\n\n150\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\nPetrol CO2 emissions (g/km)\n\n0\n\nFigure A2.4 Trends in CO2 emissions of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n200\n\n175\n\n125\n\n150\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\nDiesel average emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n48 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure A2.5 Trends in mass of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n1 400\n\n1 200\n\n1 000\n\n800\n\n400\n\n600\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2 000\n\n1 800\n\n1 600\n\nMass (kg)\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\nFigure A2.6 Trends in mass of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n1 500\n\n1 000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2 500\n\n2 000\n\nMass (kg)\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n49Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n350\n\n300\n\n200\n\n250\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\nEngine power (kW)\n\n0\n\nFigure A2.7 Trends in engine power of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\nFigure A2.8 Trends in engine power of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n180\n\n160\n\n120\n\n140\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nEngine power (kW)\n\n0\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n50 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure A2.9 Trends in engine capacity of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n3 000\n\n2 500\n\n2 000\n\n1 500\n\n1 000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n4 000\n\n3 500\n\nEngine capacity (cm3)\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\nFigure A2.10 Trends in engine capacity of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n3 000\n\n2 500\n\n2 000\n\n1 500\n\n1 000\n\n500\n\nEngine capacity (cm3)\n\n0\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n51Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nRegarding engine capacity, a small decreasing engine \ndisplacement trend was observed over the period for \nalmost all segments (Figure A2.9 and Figure A2.10). \n\nMedium\u2011sized cars' capacity remained almost stable \nfor both petrol and diesel powertrains over the period \n2010\u20112018.

Data about newly registered vans show a stable trend. New EEA data set baseline for emission reductions in heavy-duty vehicles.\nThe EEA indicator \u2018CO2 performance of new passenger cars in Europe\u2019 shows a steady decline in emissions until 2016 but, since then, average emissions of new cars have been increasing.\nIn 2019, average emissions of new passenger cars registered in the European Union, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom (UK) were 122.3 g CO2/km. This figure is below the 2015-2019 target of 130 g CO2/km but well above the 2020-2024 target of 95 g CO2/km. The results confirm the provisional data published last year.\nAccording to the EEA analysis, several reasons have contributed to the increase in average emissions, including the increasing demand for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and other larger and heavier cars. Electric vehicles constituted 3.5 % of new car registrations in 2019.\nThe EEA indicator \u2018CO2 performance of new vans in Europe\u2019 also shows a trend of relatively stable or slightly increasing emissions. In 2019, average emissions of new vans were 158.0 g CO2/km, which is about 7 % above the 2020 target of 147 gCO2/km.\nThe share of electric vans in registrations nearly doubled between from 2018 (0.8 %) to 2019 (1.4 %), but the vast majority (94 %) of new vans still ran on diesel, the EEA indicator shows.\nThe EEA has also released a new dataset about emissions of new heavy-duty vehicles, such as buses and trucks. The average specific CO2 emissions of all new heavy-duty vehicles registered in the EU from 2019 to mid-2020 stood at 53 g CO2/tkm (i.e. for the transport of one tone of goods over one kilometer). The EEA\u2019s 2019-2020 data set a baseline for these vehicles\u2019 emission reductions, with targets to reach 15 % lower emissions in 2025, and 30 % lower emissions in 2030.\nOverall, transport emissions are still about one quarter of the EU\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. The European Green Deal calls for a 90 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, compared with 1990 levels.\nThe emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place with the objective to gradually replace the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. For compliance purpose, NEDC emissions values are used in 2019.\nThe EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger cars and vans registered in Europe, in accordance with EU Regulation (EU) No 2019/631. The data are reported by all EU Member States, United Kingdom, Iceland (since 1 January 2018) and Norway (since 1 January 2019) in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet and includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle mass. The next data release includes the provisional results for new registrations in 2020.\nThe European Commission will confirm whether individual manufacturers or pools have met their own specific annual targets, which are based on the average mass of the cars registered.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/average-car-emissions-kept-increasing or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:09 AM\nFiled under: heavy duty vehicles new passenger car emissions vehicle emissions testing car emissions\nFiled under: heavy duty vehicles, new passenger car emissions, vehicle emissions testing, car emissions\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

For the first time, the average CO2 emissions from new vans also increased. Manufacturers will have to reduce emissions of their fleet significantly to meet the upcoming 2020 and 2021 targets.\nThe EEA has published the provisional data for the average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans registered in the EU and in Iceland in 2018.\nAfter a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 grammes of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km), average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017 by 0.4 g CO2/km. According the provisional data, the upward trend continued with an additional increase of 2.0 g CO2/km in 2018.\nVans registered in the EU and Iceland in 2018 emitted on average 158.1 g CO2/km, which is 2.0 grams more than in 2017. This is the first increase in average CO2 emissions from new vans since the regulation came into force in 2011, following a sharp decrease in 2017.\nThe main factors contributing to the increase of new passenger cars\u2019 emissions in 2018 include the growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, in particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. Moreover, the market penetration of zero- and low-emission vehicles, including electric cars, remained slow in 2018. With the 2021 target of 95 g CO2/km approaching, much faster deployment of cars with low emissions is needed across Europe.\nMany factors affected the increase in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, including an increase in the mass, engine capacity and size of the vehicles. The market share of petrol vehicles also increased, constituting 3.6 % of the new vans fleet (2.4 % in 2017). The share of zero- and low-emission vans remained at the same level (1.7 %) as in 2017. Further efficiency improvements are needed to reach the EU target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020.\nNew vans\nThe emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, with the objective to gradually replace the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. In 2018, Member States reported both NEDC and WLTP emission factors for around 4.4 million cars (around 30 % of new registrations). For those vehicles, the WLTP emission factor was on average 20 % higher than the NEDC emission factor.\nThe EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger cars and vans registered in Europe, in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The data reported by all EU Member States and Iceland in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle mass. For the first time, data reported by Iceland were also included.\nThe European Commission will confirm whether individual manufacturers or pools have met their own specific annual targets, which are based on the average mass of the cars registered, when the EEA publishes the final data in late 2019 or early 2020.\n2010-2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/average-co2-emissions-from-new or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 08:19 PM\nFiled under: co2 emissions cars and vans emissions transport climate change mitigation\nFiled under: co2 emissions, cars and vans emissions, transport, climate change mitigation\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "CO2 performance of new passenger cars in Europe\nFollowing a steady decline until 2016, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in Europe increased between 2017 and 2019.

The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, compared with 1990 levels, in order for the EU to become climate-neutral by 2050, while also working towards a zero-pollution ambition.\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, emission performance standards for new cars were introduced in 2009setting a fleet-wide target of 130 g CO2/km for the period 2015-2019 and 95 g CO2/km for the period 2020-2024, as well as specific CO2 emission targets for each manufacturer (or pool of manufacturers). In 2019, a new Regulationset new fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030, namely a 15% reduction from 2021 emission levels by 2025 and a 37.5% reduction by 2030.\nAfter a steady decline between 2010 and 2016, by almost 22 g CO2/km, average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017, 2018 and 2019, reaching 122.3 g CO2/km in 2019. Although this remains below the 2015-2019 target of 130 g CO2/km, it is well above the 2020-2024 target of 95 g CO2/km.\nThere are various reasons for the increase in emissions, for instance the growth in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment of the road transport sector. Almost 15.5 million new cars were registered in 2019 in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and about 38% of these were SUVs. SUVs are typically heavier than other cars and have more powerful engines and larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase fuel consumption. Most new SUVs registered were petrol vehicles, with average emissions of 134 g CO2/km, which is around 13 g CO2/km higher than other new petrol cars. Moreover, the average mass of new conventional cars, excluding SUV, increased by around 22 kg from 2018 to 2019.\nThe market penetration of electric cars remained low in 2019 and, as in 2018, petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, constituting 59% of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles constituted 31% of new registrations. Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles did continue to increase, however, reaching about 3.5% in 2019, compared with 2% in 2018. Non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are exclusively fuelled by conventional fuels, represented around 4% of new registrations. Registrations of electric vehicles, as a percentage of all newly registered cars, were highest in Norway (56%), Iceland (19%), the Netherlands (16%) and Sweden (12%). These countries were also among the few where the average emissions of new cars fell between 2018 and 2019. For more information on the uptake of electric vehicles in the EU, see the EEA indicator TERM34.\n|Man||R||Specific emissions target||Average CO2 emissions|\n|BMW GROUP pool||1003404||140.8||125.6|\n|DAIMLER AG pool||985163||139.7||136.7|\n|FCA-TESLA pool||984048||129||115.7|\n|FORD-WERKE GMBH pool||978961||133.7||130.8|\n|HONDA MOTOR EUROPE LTD pool||116980||130.8||125|\n|HYUNDAI pool||552340||128.9||124.2|\n|KIA pool||497564||128.7||122.8|\n|MG-SAIC pool||14102||140.1||124|\n|MITSUBISHI MOTORS pool||139438||133.2||115.6|\n|PSA-OPEL pool||2507547||125.7||113.9|\n|RENAULT pool||1653093||126.3||118.1|\n|SUZUKI pool||254016||123.1||120.6|\n|TATA MOTORS JAGUAR LAND ROVER pool||214955||178||157.6|\n|TOYOTA-MAZDA pool||1035435||129||108|\n|VW GROUP PC pool||3722198||133.2||123.9|\n|NISSAN INTERNATIONAL SA||391479||130.5||114.3|\n|VOLVO CAR CORPORATION||326205||148.3||131.9|\nAccording to EU legislation, manufacturers can group together as pools and act jointly to meet CO2 emission standards. Pools or individual manufacturers responsible for fewer than 300,000 newly registered cars may benefit from a derogation.\nIn 2019, almost all car manufacturers, either individually, or as members of pools or because of derogations, met their annual binding targets for newly registered passenger car fleets in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. Only four manufacturers, registering less than 13,000 vehicles a year, Automobili Lamborghini SPA, Bentley, Maserati and SsangYong, exceeded their emission targets.\nAmong the larger manufacturers, Toyota achieved the best CO2 performance, with average specific emissions of 108 g CO2/km, being closest to its 2020 objective. This performance was closely followed by those of Automobile Citroen and Peugeot, with average CO2 emissions of around 110 g CO2/km."]}
