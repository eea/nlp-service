In 2019, the network covered an area of 1 358 125 km2, encompassing nine biogeographical regions.\nThe coverage of terrestrial Natura 2000 areas was 784 994 km2 in 2019, which is 18 % of the EU\u2019s land area. This is more than the global biodiversity target for protected areas, which aims to conserve at least 17 % of terrestrial and inland water areas by 2020 (Aichi Target 11).\nWithin the legal framework of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, each Member State is required to contribute to the creation of Natura 2000 by designating sites in proportion to the natural habitat types and the habitats of species of European interest present within its territory.\nSince the Natura 2000 network was set up in 1992, its cumulative area has steadily grown, encompassing nine biogeographical regions. Terrestrial and marine sites of Community importance (SCIs), proposed SCIs and special protection areas (SACs) designated under the Habitats Directive now cover 1 068 197 km2, while Special Protection Areas (SPAs), created under the Birds Directive, cover 854 465 km2 (Figure 1). Many sites are designated under both Directives. When taking into account this overlap, the Natura 2000 network covers an overall area of 1 358 125 km2.\nNatura 2000 has stimulated a remarkable increase in the area protected in Europe and in 2019 the network covered 18 % of the combined terrestrial area of the 27 EU Member States plus the United Kingdom, with around 28 000 sites. This is above the global biodiversity Aichi Target 11, which aims to conserve at least 17 % of terrestrial and inland water areas by 2020.\nAs of end 2019, 14 Member States \u2014 Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain \u2014 had designated more than 17 % of their land area as Natura 2000 sites (see Natura 2000 Barometer for more information).\nThere are various benefits from having Natura 2000. Common methodology and criteria adopted across the EU for setting up sites ensure better ecological coherence than if the network were organised within each Member State only. This is beneficial, for example, to migratory species and makes it easier to designate sites that cross national borders.\nAn important feature is that Natura 2000 sites are not necessarily pristine areas, stripped of human impact. Their aim is not to exclude economic activity. In fact, around 40 % of their total area is farmland, with forests making up almost 50 %. The main objectives of Natura 2000 sites are to avoid activities that could seriously disturb the species or damage the habitats for which the site is designated and to take positive measures, if necessary, to maintain and restore these habitats and species in order to improve conservation. While this approach encourages sustainable management, the network can still be subject to significant pressures, such as the intensification or abandonment of traditional, extensive farming practices or even land abandonment, in particular in areas with natural constraints. Natural, old-growth forests are also subject to management intensification, and their unique biodiversity and structural features are irreversibly lost. Management of the sites is therefore a decisive factor in achieving the conservation aims; however, we currently lack comprehensive information on how efficiently these sites are managed. Incorporating Natura 2000 objectives into spatial planning is crucial. In particular, maintaining or improving connectivity between sites is of utmost importance.\nNote: More information about progress in designating marine protected areas is provided in the EEA indicator, Marine protected areas in Europe's seas (MAR 004).\nThis indicator shows the current status of implementation of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) by EU Member States.

An indicator of the change in coverage of these sites is a valuable indication of commitment to conserving biodiversity and reducing its loss.\nThe Habitats and Birds Directives aim to conserve natural habitats and wild fauna and flora within the European Union. Member States are required to propose sites for protecting the habitats and species listed in the Annexes to the Directives.\nUnder the Birds Directive, Member States designate special protection action areas (SPAs). The sites designated under the Habitats Directive include proposed sites of Community importance (pSCIs), sites of Community importance (SCIs) and special areas of conservation (SACs). The Natura 2000 network is composed of SPAs, pSCIs, SCIs and SACs. Once the lists of SCIs have been adopted, Member States must designate them as SACs as soon as possible and within six years at most.\nGlobal Aichi biodiversity target 11:\nBy 2020, at least 17 % of terrestrial and inland water areas, and 10 % of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.\n2020 EU biodiversity targets \u2014 Target 1: Fully implement the Birds and the Habitats Directives\nAction 1: Complete the establishment of the Natura 2000 network and ensure good management.\nin the Communication: Our life insurance, our natural capital: an EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 (COM(2011) 244) the European Commission has adopted a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020.

The Green Deal recognises biodiversity as a key area to contribute to climate neutrality and to eliminate disease outbreaks. This is underlined by the Deal\u2019s ambition for all EU policies to contribute to the preservation and restoration of Europe\u2019s natural capital. The new EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 (see below) and \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019 Strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food system will be central in this regard. These and many other promising initiatives as part of the Green Deal have the potential to turn the biodiversity crisis in Europe around. In order to achieve the desired impacts and be effective, however, clear objectives, measures, commitment, enforcement mechanisms, adequate financing and monitoring.\nWhat is the key objective of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030?\nDespite significant efforts by the EU Member States, biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services continue to decline. Recent data show that only 15 % of habitat and 27% of species assessments at EU level have a good conservation status, while the majority continues to have poor or bad status. This is largely due to habitat loss and fragmentation, pressures from land use change, diffuse pollution, the over-exploitation of resources, and growing impacts of invasive alien species and climate change contribute (State of nature report 2020).\nIn an effort to curb these worrying trends, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aims to ensure that ecosystems are healthy, resilient to climate change, rich in biodiversity and deliver the range of services essential to the prosperity and well-being of its citizens. The Strategy sets ambitious 2030 action-oriented targets linked to protected areas, ecosystem restoration, habitat and species status, urban green spaces, biodiversity to benefit the climate and people, and a new a new biodiversity governance framework enabling transformative change. The Strategy further outlines the ambition to strengthen the biodiversity proofing framework for EU programmes and financing instruments and aims to unlock at least \u20ac20 billion a year for spending on nature.\nHow are Europe\u2019s species and habitats protected?\nThe European Commission\u2019s EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 sets out to give nature back more than human-induced pressures take. The strategy proposes a path towards the recovery of biodiversity. It has been determined by the strategy, that recovery is strongest in protected areas. In accordance, key commitments of the strategy are linked to the expansion and enhancement of Europe\u2019s web of protected areas, the Natura 2000 network.\nKey targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030\n1 Legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU\u2019s land area and 30% of the EU\u2019s sea area and integrate ecological corridors, as part of a true Trans-European Nature Network.\n2 Strictly protects at least 30% of the EU\u2019s protected areas, including all primary and old-growth forests.\n3 Effectively manage all protected areas, defininig clear conservations objectives and measures, and monitoring them appropiately.\nThe achievement of these ambitions relies on the enforcement of the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive, together commonly referred to as \u201cNature Directives\u201d. First established over forty years ago, the Nature Directives form the legislative cornerstone of the European nature protection. They provide the framework for the establishment of an extensive network of special protection areas, the Natura 2000 network, which includes almost 28,000 sites with a total surface of over 1,3 million km2 of European terrestrial and marine habitats (Natura 2000 Barometer). This network of protected areas is one of the key instruments to protecting biodiversity in Europe. To gain an overview over all Natura 2000 sites, visit the interactive Natura 2000 Network Viewer.\nHow is progress towards nature protection goals assessed?\nIn order to assess the progress being made towards biodiversity conservation targets, the EU Birds and Habitats Directives (known collectively as the Nature Directives) require Member States to report every six years on the status of species and habitats in their territory. This includes information on population size, trends and distribution of species, along with information on the main pressures and threats and conservation measures in place to address these. The results of the EU wide assessments are then published in a \u2018State of nature in the EU\u2019 report (EEA, 2020). In addition to measuring progress being made in the Member States, a review of the Directives themselves was also undertaken in 2014 (a so-called \u2018Fitness Check\u2019) to assess their effectiveness. While the Directives were found to be \u2018fit for purpose\u2019, the assessment highlighted that their implementation needs to be improved and be more comprehensive. The European Commission reacted with the adoption of the EU Action Plan for nature, people and economy, which contains 15 actions aiming to improve the implementation and impact of the Nature Directives\nHow is biodiversity conservation supported by other EU policies?\nEfforts to protect biodiversity are not limited to the EU Nature Directives and the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Instead, a complex legislative framework of directives, policies, communications and programmes each serve to address key overarching pressures on the environment. Examples include the Common Agricultural Policy, EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species and EU Green Infrastructure Strategy. As new evidence emerges on additional threats to biodiversity and the environment, additional legislation is develop, as was the case for the recent Directive on reduction of the impact of certain plastic products in the environment.\nPolicy support\nEU Pollinators Initiative to address the decline of pollinators in the EU\nEU Wild life trade Regulations to enforce CITES Convention on EU level\nZoos Directive to strengthen the role of zoos in the conservation of biodiversity\nEU Water Framework Directive addresses integrated river basin management for Europe\nEU Forest Strategy promotes sustainable forest management to safeguard multiple functions of forest\nEU Marine Strategy Framework Directive for the protection of the marine environment across Europe\nTechnical support\nMAES \u2013 Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services with the MAES digital atlas for spatial mapping\nCopernicus \u2013 European Earth Observation Programme for information services based on satellite Earth Observation and in situ data\nBiodiversity Data Centre (BDC) provides access to data and information on species, habitat types and sites of interest in Europe\nEuropean Nature Information System (EUNIS) is an advanced cross-search tool, linking species, habitat types and sites\nBiodiversity Information System for Europe (BISE) is entry point for data and information on biodiversity\nFinancial support\nLIFE programme \u2013 EU funding instrument for the environment and climate action\nEuropean Structural Investment Funds (ESIF) to invest in job creation and a sustainable and healthy European economy and environment\nEuropean Maritime and Fisheries Fund(EMFF) to invest in the maritime economy and support fishing communities\nHorizon 2020 is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme with nearly \u20ac80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020)\nMid-term review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020\nThe 2015 mid-term review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 consisted of a Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on \"The Mid-Term Review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020\" and the more detailed Commission Staff Working Document \"EU assessment of progress in implementing the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020\".

With an area of just over 1 million km\u00b2, the central driver behind this achievement is the Natura 2000 network. On national level, countries exhibit quite distinct approaches in protected area designations and priority setting.\nOverview | Introduction | Coverage & representativity | Size | Connectivity | Protected Species & Habitats | Management | Future\nKey messages\n> Europe's protected areas cover 22.7 % of the terrestrial surface and 8.25 % of the marine realm, for the EU this figure is 25.7% of the terrestrial surface and 11.1 % of the marine realm.\n> For the last two decades, the EU Nature Directives and Natura 2000 were the main driver of protected area action in Europe.\n> The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 requires Member States to further increase the protected area coverage (to 30 %), especially with regards to offshore marine areas and areas with strict protection regimes.\nCoverage\nSince the early 1900s, there has been a continued increase in the coverage of protected areas in Europe on land and sea. As of 2020, there are a over 130 000 protected areas in the 38 EEA member countries. These sites cover over 1.27 million km\u00b2 or 22.7 % on land and approx. 570 000 km\u00b2 in the marine, covering 8.25 % of the sea. Within the EU 27 there are over 118 000 protected areas covering 1.06 million km\u00b2 or 25.7 % on land and approx. 556 000 km\u00b2 in the marine, covering 11.1 % of the sea.\nWith over 130 000 sites, Europe has more protected areas than any other continent in the world and amongst the highest proportion of its area covered by protected areas.\nProtected areas coverage across the world\nSources:\nUNEP-WCMC (2021). World Database of Protected Areas. March 2021.\nEEA, SEBI 007 (2020)\nThe protected area system in Europe is strongly influenced by the Natura 2000 network, with over 27 000 sites designated as Natura 2000 sites. Of the over 1.27 million km\u00b2 of European terrestrial surface covered by protected areas, over 760 000 km\u00b2 are part of the Natura 2000 network. This indicated, that even though national sites are predominant in numbers, the Natura 2000 network entails over 70 % of area covered by European protected areas, encompassing Europe\u2019s most representative sites. Marine Natura 2000 area covers an area of around 440 000 km\u00b2, equaling 8.8 % of the European protected area coverage on sea. As far as the terrestrial coverage is concerned, the Natura 2000 network is largely complete. The marine component of the network however is still largely incomplete in many countries, and mostly includes inshore waters, leaving the offshore waters with poor protection levels. Results show that despite the fact that coastal area makes up only a small part of the sea compared to the vast offshore waters, its marine protected area coverage is six times higher (EEA, 2018).\nThe new EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 requires EU Member States to further step up their conservation efforts to protect 30 % of both its land and sea cover by 2030, of which 10 % will have to be strictly protected. The CBD\u2019s post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will have a similar coverage target. This means that over the next decade there will be a need to expand the network in the EU, on land by about 4 % and in the seas by 19 %.\nMinimum of 30 % land and sea covered by protected areas by 2030\nLooking at the national level, the degree of protected area coverage is highly diverse. As of 2020, most countries have a terrestrial coverage of around 20 % (e.g. France, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia and Norway). The country with the highest coverage is Luxembourg with over 50 %. Countries like Bulgaria, Cyrus, Croatia, Estonia, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia have a coverage of around 40 %. However, in total numbers, France provides the highest terrestrial surface area, with close to 148 000 km2.\nMarine protected areas show an even higher margin of different coverages between European countries with access to marine waters. France (50 %) and Germany (45 %) are countries with a particular high share of marine area covered by protected areas and the (small) marine area of Slovenia even exhibits full coverage. In other countries, such as in Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, Italy, Ireland or Norway, the designation process lacks behind.\nThe coverage on national level is highly diverse, both on land and sea\nThe differences between countries can have various reasons and are highly country specific, ranging from a simple lack of resources or knowledge to complex designation issues. Looking at the Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Finland for instance, terrestrial land is only scarcely populated. Therefore, it is to argue whether vast regions need to be conserved by an official protected area designation.\nMore information on the progress of the Natura 2000 network and its coverage is available from the Natura 2000 Barometer and the Natura 2000 Network Viewer.\nOverlap\nThe degree of overlap between Natura 2000 sites and nationally designated sites illustrates the extent to which countries have made use of their nationally designated areas. It further underpins the dimensions on which Natura 2000 sites extend beyond national systems. Natura 2000 sites cover 72 % of the area of the protected areas network in the EU. Overall, the overlap between Natura 2000 and national designations amounts of 37 %, with Natura 2000 sites exclusively accounting for a further 35 % and with national sites covering a further 28 % exclusively.\nProportion of the protected areas network of the EU made up on national sites, Natura 2000 sites and the overlap between them\nSource: Marine protected areas. EEA Storymap 2018\nThere are different patterns among countries and the differences in approaches reflect the diversity of historical, geographical, administrative, political and cultural circumstances (as shown in the figure below). In establishing Natura 2000 sites, countries also have the flexibility to introduce new designation procedures, adapt existing ones or underpin designations by other legal acts. See the indicator SEBI 007 for more information.\nThe countries that joined the EU most recently \u2014 Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia \u2014 have extended their protected areas very significantly through creation of Natura 2000 sites, with little overlap. Similar situations exist in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia.\nGrowth\nEuropean protected areas have increased in number and area both on land and sea over the last number of years. In 2000, over 742 000 km\u00b2 of the terrestrial European territory (EEA38) was covered, by 2020 this figure has risen to over 1.27 million km\u00b2. In the marine realm, this figure has risen from approximately 90 000 km\u00b2 in 2000 to over 570 000 km\u00b2 in 2020. The withdrawal of United Kingdom from the EU in 2020, however, had considerable effects on the European protected area coverage, especially in the marine, with a loss of over 200 000 km\u00b2 of marine protected area.\nEEA38 terrestrial protected area growth between 2000-2018\nEEA38 marine protected area growth between 2000-2018\nEEA38 terretrial and marine protected areas growth 200-2018\nSource: Marine protected areas. EEA Storymap 2018\nMost of the protected area growth in the last 20 years in Europe can be attributed to the designation of Natura 2000 sites in the EU Member. On national level, the growth between 2000 and 2020 was highly diverse. On the one hand, there are numerous countries with a continuous rise along the years, others with sharp increases in single years. Austria, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Liechtenstein and Poland already started with a quite high area coverage which (more or less) steadily increased throughout the years. Other countries like Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, the Netherlands Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia chose a step-wise designation process in single years. For many of these countries, this is correlated with the year of accession to the EU.\nGrowth is even more pronounced for marine areas, where most countries, such as Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden had practically no or very few protected areas designated in 2000 and increased their area significantly within a few years. Other countries only showed marginal development throughout the period 2000-2020.\nRepresentativity\nEurope comprises eleven biogeographical regions that together inherit the continent\u2019s great terrestrial diversity. This diversity includes arctic polar deserts and boreal forests in the north, as well as the arid lands and dense mattoral of the south. It stretches from the steppic zones in the east to the extensive heathlands of the west. However, protected areas are not equally distributed among these regions. Whereas the Black Sea region is particularly well covered (68 %), the Boreal region (10 %) is underrepresented by protected areas.\nIn the marine realm there are four regions identified under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, with the North East Atlantic Ocean consisting of four sub-regions and the Mediterranean comprising of four sub-regions. The different regions, and sub-regions show a difference in the proportion covered by protected areas.\nProportion of each biogeographical region covered by protected areas\nMSFD Region\n% coverage\nBaltic Sea\n15.4\nNorth East Atlantic Ocean\n8.0\nBay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast\n16.4\nCeltic Seas\n8.5\nGreater North Sea, incl. the Kattegat and the English Channel\n28.0\nMacaronesia\n1.8\nMediterranean Sea\n8.9\nAdriatic Sea\n5.5\nAegean-Levantine Sea\n11.3\nIonian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea\n8.0\nWestern Mediterranean Sea\n9.2\nBlack Sea\n13.9\nThe European territory consists of a wide range of different terrestrial ecosystems. An analysis based on the MAES ecosystem grouping shows that forests (43 %) and agricultural land (42 %) are by far the two most dominant terrestrial ecosystems. The surface of inland water bodies (wetlands, rivers and lakes) is comparatively small.\nEuropean ecosystems exhibit different degrees of protected area coverage\nComposition of the EU by Ecosystem\nThe coverage of protected areas in Europe varies between the different groups of ecosystems. With 45 %, wetlands are by far the ecosystems with the highest share of protected area coverage \u2013 though the total area is comparatively small. Urban area on the other hand has\u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 the least coverage. As the most representative ecosystem, forests are protected less compared to the overall coverage of protected area in Europe.\nProportion of protected areas covering ecosystems\nIn some countries, protected areas cover the representative ecosystems well, as is the case for Austria, Luxemburg or Latvia, among others. Other countries have significant gaps between the ecosystem coverage and its share of protection. For example, while Ireland is mostly covered by grasslands and forbs, mosses or lichens (50 %), these are only poorly covered by protected area (below 15 %). Contrastingly, over 50 % of the Irish mires are covered. These figures may often reflect the national protection priorities, where most vulnerable ecosystems are purposefully targeted.\nOverseas countries & territories\nAround the world, the Europe (EEA38) includes 22 overseas entities: 9 Outermost Regions (ORs) and 13 Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). Present in every ocean and various biogeographical regions, they are home to a unique diversity of species and ecosystems of global significance, which are highly vulnerable to human impacts and increasingly the impacts of climate change. Europe overseas contain more endemic animal and plant species than are found on the whole of continental Europe, with New Caledonia alone having about as many endemic species as the European continent, and French Guiana including an area of Amazon rainforest the size of Portugal. Europe overseas also host more than 20 % of the world's coral reefs and lagoons (IUCN, 2020).\nOverseas entities are often small and very distant from the European continent, but together entail a high proportion of European biodiversity\nOCTs range from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, Southern Atlantic, Caribbean, the Arctic and Antarctic. These islands are small in either size or population and have constitutional relationships with the respective country. As they do not belong to EU territory, these Overseas Countries and Territories are not considered in the official European statistics on protected areas and are not governed by the EU environmental rules. However, they include considerable protected area coverage, mainly regarding Greenland with the largest terrestrial protected area in the world: the North-East Greenland National Park with a coverage of over 970 000 km2 as well as several large marine protected areas, such as New Caledonia\u2019s Parc Naturel de la Mer de Corail at nearly 1.3 million km2 or the 670 000 km2 R\u00e9serve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Fran\u00e7aise.\nName\nLand (% cov)\nMarine (% cov)\nAzores\n3.6\n24.5\nMadeira\n1.8\n59.8\nCanary Islands\n3.9\n46.8\nFrench Guiana\n1.0\n52.5\nGuadeloupe\n100\n69.7\nMartinique\n100\n65.3\nSaint-Martin\n100\n13.3\nMayotte\n100\n11.1\nReunion\n0.01\n63.1\nNine regions of the EU are further classified as ORs: five French overseas departments, the French overseas communities of Saint-Martin, the Spanish Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands and the Portuguese autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira.\nMost of the outermost regions have a terrestrial protected area coverage of around 50 %\nIn contrast to the Overseas Countries and Territories, these regions form part of the EU territory and its legal obligations. Most of these regions have a terrestrial protected area coverage of around 50 %. Full marine protection is achieved in Mayotte, Saint Mart\u00edn, Martinique and Guadeloupe, together covering an area of over 200 000 km2. Other countries, such as R\u00e9union, the Azores and French Guiana, show considerable potential for additional marine protected area designations.\nEfforts by the EU to foster protection in these regions is reinforced with its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 indicating specific actions. Existing EU programmes include the voluntary scheme of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Territories of European overseas (BEST) coordinated by IUCN and partners. Since its establishment in 2010, BEST aims to support the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of ecosystem services through the funding of small-scale and medium-scale field actions.\nDrivers for protected areas growth\nDrivers and reasons of protected area designations can be manifold. Nonetheless, the recent growth of protected areas in Europe can very frequently be attributed i) to the implementation of the EU Nature Directives and the objectives of the Natura 2000 and ii) to the Aichi Target 11 of the CBD\u2019s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. The growth characteristics of the European protected areas, for example, show that the accession to the EU had a significant influence on the respective protected area coverage. Generally, the positive effect of the Natura 2000 network are noticeable throughout all statistics in this report, as for example with regard to the degree of connectivity (see Connectivity) and the implementation of systematic management (see Management). So despite ongoing shortcomings, the Natura 2000 network has already contributed protecting a considerable share of European ecosystems and its species.\nReferences\n- EEA (2018).

This European database is generally updated once a year to take into account any updating of national databases by Member States. However, the release of a new EU-wide database does not necessarily mean that a particular national dataset has recently been updated.\nThe descriptive data in the European database are based on the information that national authorities have submitted, for each of the Natura 2000 sites, through a site-specific standard data form (SDF). In addition to other site-specific information, the standard data form provides the list of all species and habitat types for which a site is officially designated.\nThe spatial data (outlining the boundaries of sites) submitted by each Member State are validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA).\nAny problems identified through the above validation procedures in the national datasets are brought to the attention of the Member States concerned. However, it remains up to the Member States to decide whether to submit a revised dataset before the European database is updated. The EEA therefore cannot guarantee that all inconsistences detected in national datasets are removed in the European dataset.\nPlease note that some Member States have submitted sensitive information that has been filtered out of this database. The following Member States have submitted sensitive information: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. This concerns mainly species associated to specific sites. All reference to these species has been removed from the related sites. If this sensitive information is necessary to your field of research, please contact the Member State administrations individually.

Current analyses show, however, that while protection is increasingly secured on paper, the progress on improving the management and assessing the effectiveness of measures has been rather low.\nOverview | Introduction | Coverage & representativity | Size | Connectivity | Protected Species & Habitats | Management | Future\nKey messages\n> Progress in improving the management and assessing the effectiveness of measures has been rather low in the last years\n> Efforts in undertaking individual assessments of protected area management effectiveness (PAME) are still lacking, so that systematic EU assessments are so far inconclusive\n> Future actions should focus on enhancing enforcement of Natura 2000 legal requirements, closing investment gaps, increasing access to knowledge, training and stakeholder participation, showcasing best-practices examples and improving current Natura 2000 reporting, among others\nManagement regimes of protected areas vary greatly. Some protected areas ban activities such as hunting or extraction of natural resources, while for others, human activities are part of their identity and even necessary for maintaining and restoring target species and habitats. Depending on the individual protected area classification and its usage (e.g. recreational or cultural), species and habitat composition, as well as specific biogeographic and socio-economic characteristics, tailored management options must be identified.\nManagement regimes of protected areas vary greatly and there is a general lack of information on this\nAt EU level, the Nature Directives require Member States to implement targeted conservation measures for their Natura 2000 sites. Within six years of their designation as Sites of Community Importance (SCIs), Member States need to designate these sites as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and adopt conservation measures involving \u2013 if needed \u2013 appropriate management plans and other measures which correspond to the respective ecological realities. Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated under the Birds Directive need to be managed in accordance with the ecological needs of habitats of birds. Many Member States failed to meet the deadline of SAC designations, so that the process is still ongoing. Deciding on appropriate methods and instruments to practically achieve the conservation objectives is left to the Member States and local implementing bodies.\n49 % Natura 2000 sites with management plans\nAs of the Nature Directives\u2019 reporting 2013-2018, more than 15 000 SACs (80 % of all SACs) and 3 100 SPAs (57 % of all SPAs) laid out comprehensive management plans (with potential double-counting due to overlap between SACs and SPAs). Based on the analysis of the current reporting period, it results in a cumulative SAC area of 358 000 km2 and 475 700 km2 of SPA area.\nOne of the main challenges for Member States in drafting management plans has been to meet the requirements of the Nature Directives to ensure an adequate species and habitat protection. Specifically, this entails establishing conservation objectives for each species and habitat of Community interest and taking into account the site\u2019s importance for the overall maintenance and restoration of favourable conservation status of the species and habitat. Only very few countries appear to adopt a more strategic approach to objective setting that considers the importance of each site in relation to higher level conservation objectives (Gerritsen et al., 2020).\nClear conservation objectives and appropriate management plans need to be set\nHowever, it is not only a question, if in fact protected areas are managed, but also how they are managed. Apart from its quantitative part, the Aichi Target 11 of the CBD\u2019s Strategic plan 2011-2020 set out the commitment to secure a system of \u2018effectively and equitably managed\u2019 protected and conserved areas. This commitment was reiterated in 2016, when Parties committed i) to undertake more systematic assessments of protected area management effectiveness (PAME) and their biodiversity outcomes, and ii) to provide information on the results to the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME). As a result, it is the most comprehensive repository of global PAME information, containing records from over 28 283 different protected areas and representing around 20 % of the global protected area coverage (UNEP-WCMC et al., 2020). The database is hosted on the Protected Planet website.\nNumber of reported management effectiveness assessments within UN Environment regions, including repeat assessments of the same site\nSource:Protected Planet Report, Status 2019\nA recent study commissioned by the EEA on the management effectiveness of the EU\u2019s Natura 2000 network conducted an analysis on PAME for the EU Member States. Results show, that methodologies for PAME assessments are well-established. However, most approaches focus on the early stages of the protected area management cycle (e.g. planning) rather than on actual conservation outcomes. Only 15 Member States reported so-called \u2018repeat assessments\u2019, and usually only for a small number of sites. The EU and its Member States, as parties to the CBD, committed to assess management effectiveness of 60 % of the total protected area covered by 2015. Based on reporting to the GD-PAME, only 7.6 % of recorded protected area in the EU has been assessed. The findings indicate significant underreporting by EU Member States and suggests that the EU is well off its global target.\nSystematic EU assessment on management effectiveness so far is inconclusive\nThe same study also confirmed findings of earlier evaluations that full and timely implementation of the Nature Directives would have resulted in more effective management. A great body of evidence on Natura 2000 implementation has been established in recent years confirming huge progress in many Member States. Still, there were many cases of late, inadequate and/or absent management and established measures that demonstrated the need for a more pro-active approach between the European Commission and Member States on implementation and enforcement. Though some Member States developed specific national approaches to improve Natura 2000 management in their countries, it is currently not possible to monitor management effectiveness within the Natura 2000 Network, e.g. due to missing coordination, knowledge and resource capacities on national/regional level as well as suitable indicators for effective monitoring.\nKey actions therefore have to be taken by the European Commission, EU Member States and local entities to\n- achieve more transparent and strategic enforcement of key EU legal requirements relevant to Natura 2000 effectiveness\n- integrate Natura 2000 management requirements into other relevant sectoral plans and policies\n- fill investment gap for management to ensure for implementation of the Nature Directives and restoration of ecosystems more broadly\n- address knowledge and communication gaps in science, policy, and practice\n- facilitate targeted knowledge sharing on management effectiveness evaluation\n- improve current Natura 2000 reporting in terms of management effectiveness in a cost-effective way\n- implement effective management plans on local level as well as a mechanism for revision and adaptation of the plan as required by the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030\nReferences\nDavis, M., R\u00f6schel, L., Naumann, S., McFarland, K., Graf, A., 2020, \u2018Literature Review: The ecological effectiveness of the Natura 2000 Network\u2019, European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity.\nEEA (2020) Management effectiveness in the EU's Natura 2000 network of protected areas , Briefing no. 11/2020\nEEA (2020) Management effectiveness in the EU\u2019s Natura 2000 network of protected areas: Report\nUNEP-WCMC, IUCN and NGS (2020).

The habitat is found around the coastlines of the Baltic Sea on areas of land upheaval where livestock has been grazing since prehistoric times, preventing the establishment of forest. It occurs mainly in the Boreal biogeographic region in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Sweden.\nThe potential range of coastal meadows in Finland lies along the whole coastline from the Eastern Gulf of Finland to the bottom of the Bothnian Bay. In Finland, the conservation status was assessed as unfavourable-bad on previous reporting rounds 2007 and 2013 under the EU Habitats Directive.\nAbandonment of traditional agricultural activities has made this habitat endangered throughout its range. Other pressures are mixed source pollution to surface and ground waters (eutrophication of the Baltic Sea coastal waters), modification of coastline, estuary and coastal conditions for development and invasive alien species.\nChallenges addressed\nThe major cause for the unfavourable status is the abandonment of traditional agriculture (i.e. low intensity grazing and periodic cutting) since the 1950s, which has led to overgrowth with homogenous reedbeds, shrubs and trees. Historically, coastal meadows around the Baltic were grazed with dairy heifers, beef cattle, sheep, or mixed herds, either privately owned by farmers or jointly grazed as common land (Rannap et al, 2004). However, sheep grazing in Finland is rare as the meadows are too wet. Since dairy farming has become uneconomical on these grasslands, many have been abandoned. In Finland, the number of livestock farms and the number of livestock have declined drastically. Vegetation growth due to abandonment is exacerbated by eutrophication from diffuse pollution to surface waters from agricultural and forestry activities and from untreated wastewater from summer cabins or cottages (pollution from untreated urban wastewater ceased in the 1970s). Eutrophication drives the growth of thick reed beds in shallow water, and cattle will keep away from high reed beds.\nObjectives\nThe range of the habitat in Finland is at favourable status so the main issues addressed were to increase the surface area of the habitat type and improve the structure and function of existing occurrences. National support aims towards the restoration of coastal meadows in Natura 2000 areas and beyond by a series of actions aimed to reduce the extent of encroaching reed beds, followed by reinstating of agricultural measures for the upkeep of the habitat.\nPlanned and implemented measures\nConservation measures have been undertaken both with national funding by the Finnish conservation authorities as part of the delivery of nature conservation programmes (establishing protected areas), and the management of private and state owned protected areas, as well as by farmers motivated and financed by Finnish Rural Development Programme funding through agri-environment and non-productive investment payments under Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy. Meadow management was done in close co-operation with local cattle owners, who apply for agri-environment payments. Eradication of invasive species is done by local hunters. The most important measures for restoration of the habitat during the period 2013\u20132018 have been removal of reeds and shrubs and reinstatement of grazing with cattle or sheep. Other measures include maintaining existing extensive agricultural practices and agricultural landscape features; managing conversion of land for construction and development of infrastructure; and management, control and eradication of invasive alien species, mainly the American Mink (Neovison vison) and Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).\nThe role of Natura 2000 network is essential for the conservation of coastal meadows. Out of the total area, 56 km2 is located within the network. There are currently 98 designated areas for coastal meadows, with six new designations during the current reporting period. The importance of coastal meadows for breeding birds is highlighted with the fact that out of the total 98 sites 56 are also classified as SPA sites.\nStakeholder involvement\nA key challenge was to grant access of grazing areas to cattle owners. While cattle owners were generally interested in expanding their grazing areas, this task required good coordination of potential areas, as well as good knowledge of potential farmers. Therefore, in many areas, a key issue is how to get farmers and areas to find each other. The good network of managed coastal meadows in state owned conservation areas on the southern coast of Finland, and the conservation agency\u2019s database of state owned areas granted a \u201cmarketing\u201d of these areas for potential farmers. A website is used for announcing available grazing sites or available grazing animals, maintained by Pro Agria (farmers advisory organisation).\nKey achievements and impacts\nThe efforts during the current reporting period have been successful; the total surface area of Boreal Baltic coastal meadows in Finland was increased from 60 km2 to 62 km2. The status of structure and function of the habitat improved from U2+ to U1+. Approximately 68 % of the total habitat area is now in good condition and the trend is improving. Finland reported the overall conservation status as U1+. Coastal meadows are also a key breeding habitat of the Birds Directive Annex I taxa Baltic Dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) and Ruff (Philomachus pugnax) and also for Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa). Thanks to the successful management efforts, especially in the northern parts of the Bothnia Bay, the breeding population of these rare species is locally increasing.\nCosts and financing\nAs this habitat type depends on continuous management the outlook of Boreal Baltic coastal meadows in Finland is linked with the available resources. National funding will be directed to the management of traditional rural biotopes through a new strategic nature conservation, restoration and management programme (HELMI-programme, 2020\u20132030) and coastal meadows are included within a recently launched LIFE-project (CoastNet LIFE, LIFE17NAT/FI/000544) focusing on the restoration of coastal habitats. CoastNet LIFE (2018-2025) has a total budget of over 8 M\u20ac. However, the key funding element for coastal meadows will continue to be the agri-environment payments through the Finnish Rural Development Programme. The positive trend of coastal meadows in Finland is thus dependent on the contents of the next period of the Common Agricultural Policy.\nLessons learned\n- Management of privately owned and abandoned areas of habitat within Natura 2000 sites has relied on the intervention of the responsible local authority\n- Reinstating management of privately owned areas of habitat has sometimes been difficult. For example, none of the privately owned areas targeted by the LIFE03 NAT/FIN/000039 project (2003-2007) are covered by agri-environmental contracts ten years after the project end and they are no longer grazed. In privately owned Natura 2000 areas, the ownership structure is often fragmented and includes some elderly landowners who have found the application process for agri-environment subsidies too laborious to pursue. Management plans for some of the privately owned land areas were not seen as a sufficient management tool, as they were not binding and in several cases the owner did not abide by the plans\u2026\nReference information\nLinks to further information\nEUNIS Factsheet for Boreal Baltic coastal meadows: https://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats/10033\nLIFE project \u201cGulf of Finland \u2013 Management of wetlands along the Gulf of Finland migratory flyway\u201d: https://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=2459\nThe information presented here is based on\nKer\u00e4nen, I., et al., 2020, \u2018Boreal Baltic coastal meadows in Finland\u2019, Good practice example from Finland (sent by e-mail), Finnish Environment Institute, Ministry of the Environment, Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, Southwest Finland, Parks & Wildlife Finland\nThe work done as part of the European Commission study on identifying the drivers of successful implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives (under contract ENV.F.1/FRA/2014/0063), carried out by the Institute for European Environmental Policy, BirdLife International, Deloitte, Denkstatt, Ecologic, ICF Consulting Services and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.

To this aim, Member States have designated Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for migratory and particularly threatened bird species (according to Birds Directive Article 4) and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) to ensure the favourable conservation status of each habitat type and species (according to Habitats Directive Article 3 and 4). As the terrestrial component of the Natura 2000 network is largely complete, current efforts target the adoption of appropriate conservation measures and management plans for protected sites (see more information Protected area report). The marine component of the network is, however, largely incomplete in many countries. Those areas which are protected are largely inshore waters, while offshore waters often still have poor protection levels. More information on the state of the Natura 2000 network and its coverage is available from the Natura 2000 Barometer and the Natura 2000 Network Viewer. In addition to the areas covered by the Natura 2000 network, Member States inherit over 105 000 nationally designated areas that are not part of the Natura 2000 network.\nHow do Member States report on the status of biodiversity?\nUnder the Birds and Habitats Directives, Article 12 (Birds Directive) and Article 17 (Habitats Directive) require Member States to report every six years on the conservation status of habitats and species and related trends (an overview of reporting can be found here for Habitats Directive Reporting and here for Birds Directive Reporting). The main objective is to maintain and restore habitats and species to a favourable conservation status. Reported data is also used to recognize relevant pressures and threats, to identify conservation measures and to assess data quality. Information is gathered for each biogeographical and marine region as well as on the number of protected sites and their surface area, the proportion of sites with management plans and the measures undertaken on the protected sites. The latest reporting period covers progress made between 2013 and 2018. Aggregated results of this EU assessment are available online and published in the \u2018State of Nature in the EU 2020\u2019 report (see more information on current reporting, State of nature report 2020).\nMember State reporting is also used to assess progress towards the EU Biodiversity Strategy\u2019s headline target to halt the loss of biodiversity and its first target. In line with Target 2 and Action 5 of the Strategy, Member States are to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services (\u2018MAES\u2019) within their national territory. This process also requires Member States to assess the economic value of such services, and promote the integration of these values into accounting.\nHow do Member States comply with global biodiversity targets?\nIn addition to EU legislative obligations, countries which are Parties of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agree to translate the overarching international framework into revised and updated National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) (see statistics and documents per country here). Moreover, MS are requested to submit National Reports for reviewing progress towards the implementation of the Strategic Plan 2011-2020 and its Aichi Targets. The main focus of the reporting lies on how the NBSAPs have been updated and implemented as well as how the measures contribute to the achievement of the targets (results from the sixth reporting period can be found here).\nMore country-specific information regarding national policies, the state of native species and habitats as well as facts on nationally designated protected areas and Natura 2000 sites can be accessed via the search engine."]}
