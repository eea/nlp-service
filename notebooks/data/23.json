In particular, 97% of the urban population was exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter\u00a0(PM2.5) above the new WHO guideline level of 5 \u00b5g/m3.\r\nFigure 1.

They are emitted mainly by the combustion of fuels for domestic heating, while industrial activities, agriculture and road transport are also important sources. Some come also from natural sources such as sea salt or Saharan dust and, finally, some are formed in the atmosphere from the combination of different gases.\r\nAlthough exceedances of the EU daily limit value are widespread across the continent, the highest concentrations were found in some countries in central and\u00a0eastern Europe and in northern Italy. In most countries of central and\u00a0 eastern Europe, solid fuels such as coal are widely used for heating households and in some industrial facilities and power plants. The Po Valley, in northern Italy, is a densely populated and industrialised area with specific meteorological conditions that favour the accumulation of air pollutants in the atmosphere.\r\nFigure 2.

They are emitted mainly by the combustion of fuels for domestic heating, industrial activities, and road transport. As with PM10, they can also come from natural sources and can be formed in the atmosphere. Agricultural emissions of ammonia make a significant contribution to the formation of particulate matter in the atmosphere.\r\nThe highest concentrations were found in central and eastern Europe and northern Italy. As for PM10, the use of solid fuels is the main reason for the situation in central and eastern Europe, together with an older vehicle fleet. In northern Italy, the high concentrations are due to the combination of a high density of anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions that favour the accumulation of air pollutants in the atmosphere.\r\nFigure 5.

Emissions of these gases are anthropogenic and, in the case of VOCs, also biogenic. Ozone also enters Europe from other parts of the northern hemisphere and from the upper atmosphere. Meteorology plays an important role in the formation and interannual variation of air pollutant concentrations, and this effect is especially significant for ozone.\r\nFigure 8.

Andorra was the only country in which all reported concentrations were below the long-term objective.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main source of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is road transport, which emits NO2 close to the ground and mostly in densely populated areas, contributing to population exposure. Other important sources are combustion processes in industry and energy supply.\r\nThe highest concentrations\u00a0were found\u00a0across Europe in bigger cities with a high traffic volume.\u00a0The impact of the COVID-19 related lockdown measures during the reporting period is clearly seen for this air pollutant, as its main source \u2014 road transport \u2014 was also one of the most reduced activities.\r\nFigure 11: Concentrations of NO2 in 2019 and 2020 in relation to the EU annual limit value\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nConcentrations of\u00a0NO2 in 2019:\r\n\r\n22 reporting countries, of which 18 were EU Member States, registered concentrations above the EU annual limit value of 40 \u00b5g/m3\r\nAll the reporting countries registered concentrations above the WHO AGQ of 10 \u00b5g/m3\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12.

These measures resulted in a reduction of many activities (such as road transport, aviation, shipping, some industries), while some others remained more or less unchanged (such as agriculture) or might have increased such as household energy consumption.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhere do the data come from?\r\n\r\nThe concentrations are obtained from measurements in monitoring stations that are officially reported to the EEA by its member countries. The\u00a0classification\u00a0of the monitoring stations and the criteria used to determine their inclusion in the analyses are described\u00a0here.\u00a0The countries that submitted data are summarised in\u00a0Table 1\u00a0for 2019, and\u00a0Table 2\u00a0for 2020.\r\nThe analysis for 2019 is based on validated data that are verified by the countries. The analysis for 2020 is based on provisional data reported in near-real time throughout the year. The analysis for 2020 is, therefore, provisional, and may change once the set of fully validated data is received by the EEA and more countries are considered.\r\nFurther information on the concentrations of air pollutants, including those for previous years, can be found at the EEA's\u00a0statistics viewer.

Where you live, has an impact on the risks to which you are exposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople in bigger cities tend to be exposed to higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide because of emissions from traffic\r\nIn central and eastern Europe, the burning of solid fuels for domestic heating and their use in industry results in the highest concentrations of particulate matter and benzo[a]pyrene (a carcinogen)\r\nPeople in southern Europe are exposed to the highest concentrations of ozone, the formation of which is driven by sunlight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn apparent improvement in air quality in 2020 is likely explained by weather patterns and the impact of lockdown measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nAir pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe, causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, that, in the most serious cases, lead to premature deaths. This EEA briefing gives the status of concentrations of pollutants in ambient air in 2019 and 2020 presented by pollutant, as relates to both EU air quality standards and WHO guideline levels. The assessment shows that, in spite of improvements in air quality in recent years, exceedances of standards are still common across the EU.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has established air quality guidelines (AQG), or recommendations for maximum concentrations to protect human health from the impacts of air pollutants. These values are based on scientific evidence. The EU\u00b4s Ambient Air Quality Directives set maximum values (limit and target) for the concentration levels for a total of 13 air pollutants. Although these values are based on the WHO AQG, they also take into account the technical and economic feasibility of their attainment across EU Member States. For most air pollutants, the EU air quality standards are less strict than the WHO AQG.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFigure 1. Share of the EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above EU standards and WHO guidelines in 2018-2019\r\n\r\nSource: CSI004\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhen the maximum EU limit or target values are exceeded, the relevant authorities (such as a city council) must implement air quality plans and measures to reduce levels of air pollutants as quickly as possible. Air quality plans and measures may also be implemented in cases where air quality is good, either to maintain healthy levels or to improve them.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis analysis highlights those pollutants deemed to be most harmful to human health and the environment or that exceed the maximum EU air quality standards and WHO guideline levels most frequently. The data were extracted from the EEA\u2019s reporting system on 27 April 2021.\r\nThe analysis of 2019 validated data includes maps and boxplots, while the analysis of provisional 2020 up-to-date (UTD) data includes only maps. 2020 validated data will be available later this year and presented in the 2022 air quality report.\r\nThe lists of countries that submitted data for 2019 and for 2020, additional information and further analysis can be found in the Eionet status reports ETC/ATNI 2021/7 and ETC/ATNI 2021/8, prepared by the European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, Noise and Industrial Pollution.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNavigate the tabs for information on each pollutant:\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPM10\r\nPM2.5\r\nOzone\r\nNO2\r\nBaP\r\nOther pollutants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPM10 are particulate matter with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m or less.

Maintaining this flow and keeping it free of pollution is vital for both humans and surface water ecosystems\nIntroduction\nGroundwater provides a major source of drinking water for many EU citizens and provides the steady base flow of rivers and wetlands. Keeping groundwater free of pollution is vital for humans and river and wetland ecosystems. Once pollutants are in groundwater, recovery can take years or even many decades because of residence times and the slow degradation of pollutants.\nDo you know?\nIn the EU, around 75 % of the groundwater body area is in good chemical status\nNitrate is the most common pollutant causing failure to achieve good groundwater chemical status. It affects 18 % of the groundwater area\nNitrates in groundwater are linked to sustained pressure from agriculture and long recovery times\nGroundwater chemical status\nFIGURE 1\nAssessment of chemical status or potential of groundwater bodies\nSource: European waters. Assessment of status and pressures 2018. EEA Re. port No 7/2018\nTo achieve good groundwater chemical status, EU member states and Norway assess their groundwater bodies according to four criteria:\n- Concentrations of pollutants do not exceed the standards set for groundwater\n- Absence of saline intrusion in the groundwater body\n- Pollution levels must not impact ecological or chemical status of surface waters\n- Pollution levels must not cause significant damage to ecosystems and wetlands that depend directly on the groundwater body.\nConcentrations must comply with EU standards for nitrates and pesticides, and with national threshold values for other groundwater pollutants. EU standards for nitrates is 50 mg/l and for pesticides it is 0.1 \u03bcg/l for individual pesticides and a total maximum 0.5 \u03bcg/l. Threshold values for other pollutants can be set at the level of the groundwater body, national river basin or international river basins. In part this flexibility is necessary due to the variability in concentration of naturally occurring substances. Furthermore, some substances in groundwater may be of natural origin, e.g. when the bedrock contains high concentrations of metals and salts, and as such they are not considered pollution.\nChemical status assessments of groundwater are performed by all EU Member States every 6 years, in 2009, 2015, and 2021. On the scale of Europe, around 75 % of the groundwater body area is in good chemical status, 24 % failed achieving good chemical status, and 1 % is in unknown status (FIGURE 2). The overall groundwater chemical status has not improved since 2009.The results of the 2021 assessments are not yet known.\nPressures on groundwater chemical status\nEU Member States and Norway reported a total of 160 chemicals causing poor chemical status. The list of substances most frequently leading to groundwater body poor chemical status is dominated by nitrates and pesticides used in agriculture and arising from salt intrusion. In addition, some industrial chemicals lead to failure, such as tetrachloroethylene, used as a solvent, and metals such as arsenic, nickel and lead, which arise from, for example, mining, contaminated sites and waste water.\nNitrates are reported as the reason for failing to achieve good groundwater status by 24 countries, and in 18% of the groundwater area. Pesticides also commonly cause failure and affect 6.5% of the groundwater area. Nitrates and pesticides are extensively used in agriculture and reach groundwater through diffuse pollution. Where fertilizers, manure and pesticides are applied to crops in excess, they present a significant and widespread challenge.\nfff\nReferences\nThe main reference used in this page is:\n.\nRelated Resources\nGroundwater chemical status in Data, maps and tools section\nThe data, dashboards and maps available from the WISE Freshwater resource catalogue:\n- Groundwater bodies: Chemical status (2nd and 1st RBMP), by geological formation [chart]\n- Groundwater bodies: Chemical status (2nd and 1st RBMP), by country [chart]\n- Groundwater bodies: Reasons for failure to achieve good chemical status [overview chart]\n- Groundwater bodies: Chemical status [table]\n- Groundwater bodies: Proportion failing to achieve good status, by RBD [map]", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

To this day, the nature directives \u2014 the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, first adopted in 1979 and 1992, respectively \u2014 constitute the cornerstone of the EU\u2019s efforts to protect and preserve biodiversity.\nThe two directives put many species and habitats under a common protection scheme with regular monitoring and reporting requirements. The degradation documented thanks to these directives calls for more extensive and coordinated action across many policy domains in Europe and globally.\nToday, the EU has one of the most comprehensive sets of environment and climate legislation in the world. Some EU laws tackle pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions, pollution levels in the air or water, or emissions from specific sources, such as industry or transport.\nSome EU nature legislation, such as the EU Pollinators Initiative, call for targeted action. Others, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in particular, play a central role in protecting nature through ecosystem-based management. The WFD requires Member States to achieve \u2018good status\u2019 for all water bodies (lakes, rivers and groundwater) through sustainable and coordinated management of entire river basins.\nSimilarly, the MSFD calls for good environmental status in the marine environment, tackling pressures and pollution. Nature-related legislation is supported by, among other things, circular economy legislation aimed at reducing waste and contamination risks, for example through better waste management, improved eco-design and limiting single-use plastics.\nThese laws help EU Member States enjoy cleaner air, shift towards cleaner energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and place an increasing share of their land and marine areas under protection, including through the Natura 2000 network. The EU green infrastructure connects more and more natural spaces, allowing wildlife to move between them. Cities are planning green and blue spaces as a way to prepare for climate change impacts and help preserve biodiversity.\nThe European Green Deal outlines the EU\u2019s long-term ambition of becoming the first climate-neutral continent with a sustainable economy by 2050 and is implemented through key policy instruments such as the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy, the EU strategy on adaptation to climate change and the new EU forest strategy for 2030. It is also supported by others, including the circular economy action plan, the chemicals strategy and the zero pollution action plan.\nTo reduce pressures on nature, halt the decline and restore biodiversity, Europe will need to act on all fronts, transform its energy, food and mobility systems, and do so with global partners.\nBISE \u2014 Biodiversity Information System for Europe: the key source of data and information about biodiversity in Europe.\nFISE \u2014 Forest Information System for Europe: an entry point for sharing information with the forest community on Europe\u2019s forest environment, its state and development.\nWISE \u2014 Water Information System for Europe: the European information gateway to water issues.

The other assessment is groundwater chemical status.\nIntroduction\nGroundwater aquifers provide around 42 % of the total water abstraction in Europe, most of which is used for public water supply, agricultural activities, and industry. In Europe, about half of the drinking water is taken from groundwater, with many large cities depending on it for their water supply. Groundwater is also used for irrigation. There can be multiple uses affecting the quantitative status of a groundwater body.\nDo you know?\nAround 90 % of the area of groundwater bodies is reported to be in good quantitative status. Significant groundwater depletion occurs Malta, Cyprus, and Spain\nThe main pressure causing failure to achieve good quantitative status is water abstraction for public water supply, agriculture, and industry\nGroundwater is the water below the Earth's surface in the fractures of rock formations and in soil pore spaces. Groundwater aquifers are embedded in geological layers. The groundwater body is a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers\nGroundwater quantitative status\nThe Water Framework Directive requires good quantitative to be achieved by ensuring that the available groundwater resource is not exceeded by the long-term annual average rate of abstraction.\nFIGURE 1\nAssessment of quantitative status of groundwater bodies\nSource: European waters. Assessment of status and pressures 2018. EEA Report No 7/2018\nThere is a close relationship between groundwater and surface waters. Groundwater provides the steady base flow of rivers and wetlands, hence lowering of the water table in groundwater reservoirs may also impact surface waters and wetlands.\nAccordingly, the groundwater level may not be subject to:\nany deterioration of the ecological status of surface waters\nany significant damage to groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems\nany flow reversals that lead to saline or other intrusions.\nGroundwaters are assessed as being in good or failing to achieve good quantitative status.\nAssessment of quantitative status\nEU member States and Norway assessed chemical status in 2009, 2015, and most recently in 2021. The results of the 2021 assessment are not yet known.\nIn 2015, around 90 % of the area of groundwater bodies is reported to be in good quantitative status (FIGURE 2). However, European statistics mask that there are significant problems with quantitative status in Malta and Cyprus, as well as some river basin districts in Spain (FIGURE 3).\nNote:\nGroundwater bodies are characterised by their geology and productivity. Under the Water Framework Directive, groundwaters are classified as porous, fissured, fractured or other aquifers. More than half are porous aquifers, followed by fissured aquifers, and these are generally highly to moderately productive. Fractured aquifers, including karst, and local and limited aquifers, which are less common.\nFake\nFake\nfff\nReferences\nThe main reference used in this page is:\n.\nRelated Resources\nThe data, dashboards and maps available from the WISE Freshwater resource catalogue:\n- Groundwater bodies: Quantitative status (2nd and 1st RBMP), by country [chart]\n- Groundwater bodies: Reasons for failure to achieve good quantitative status [overview chart]\n- Groundwater bodies: Quantitative status [table]\n- Groundwater bodies: Quantitative status (2nd and 1st RBMP), by geological formation [chart]\n- Groundwater bodies: Proportion failing to achieve good status, by RBD [map]", "Ecological status of surface waters in Europe\nThe Water Framework Directive aims to achieve good status for all rivers, lakes and transitional and coastal waters in the EU. Achieving good ecological status for surface waters is critical to this. According to countries\u2019 second river basin management plans, good ecological status had been achieved for around 40% of surface waters (rivers, lakes and transitional and coastal waters) by 2015. However, these plans show only limited improvement in ecological status since the first plans were published in 2009, with ecological status remaining similar for most water bodies.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Waters percentage||Bad||Poor||Moderate||Good||High||Sum||Val|\n|Coastal waters (5 083)||110||379||1492||2557||545||5083||abs|\n|Transitional waters (901)||57||150||397||213||84||901||abs|\n|Lakes (24 658)||804||2004||8008||9864||3978||24658||abs|\n|Rivers (108 849)||5835||13822||41446||35893||11853||108849||abs|\n|Coastal waters (5 083)||2.16||7.46||29.35||50.3||10.72||100||prc|\n|Transitional waters (901)||6.33||16.65||44.06||23.64||9.32||100||prc|\n|Lakes (24 658)||3.26||8.13||32.48||40||16.13||100||prc|\n|Rivers (108 849)||5.36||12.7||38.08||32.98||10.89||100||prc|\nSurface waters are important habitats. They are key for supporting society and the economy throughout Europe and clean, unpolluted waters are essential for healthy ecosystems. However, surface waters have traditionally been used as disposal routes for human, agricultural and industrial wastes, damaging water quality. They have also been altered (by building dams and canals, etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation, produce energy and protect against flooding, all of which can change and degrade habitats.\nThe Water Framework Directive (WFD) stipulates that EU Member States should aim to achieve good status for all surface water and groundwater bodies. Ecological status and potential are criteria used to assess the quality of the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. Ecological status is influenced by water quality (e.g. pollution) and habitat degradation, and is used as a proxy for the overall status of water bodies.\nAccording to countries\u2019 second river basin management plans (RBMPs) covering the period up to 2015, good or better (high) ecological status has been achieved for only around 40% of surface waters (rivers, lakes, and transitional and coastal waters). Moreover, there has been little improvement in ecological status since the publication of the first RBMPs in 2009, with the status of most water bodies remaining similar. Despite this lack of overall improvement, the status of many of the individual elements that make up ecological status has improved.\nThe main pressures on surface water bodies are pollution from point (e.g. waste water) and diffuse (e.g. agriculture) sources, and various hydromorphological pressures such as barriers (dams), and low-flow or channelised rivers, with the main impacts being nutrient enrichment, chemical pollution and habitat alterations due to morphological changes.\nTo improve and restore the approximately 60% of surface waters in the EU that still have less than good ecological status, and meet WFD objectives, full implementation of management and mitigation measures under the WFD, in combination with full implementation of measures under other relevant directives, is needed.\nThe percentage of water bodies with less than good (i.e. moderate, poor or bad) ecological status varies between river basin districts (RBDs) across Europe. Surface water bodies in north-western Europe have the lowest status. In Belgium (Flanders), northern Germany and the Netherlands, the ecological status of more than 90% of surface waters is reported to be less than good. Other problem areas include Czechia, southern England (United Kingdom), northern France, southern Germany, Hungary and Poland, as well as several individual RBDs in some countries, where 70-90% of surface water bodies are reported to have less than good status.\nNorthern countries, particularly the northern Scandinavian region, Iceland, Ireland and Scotland (United Kingdom), along with Estonia, Romania, Slovakia and several RBDs in the Mediterranean region, have a high proportion of water bodies with good or better (high) ecological status or potential."]}
