While some land was re-cultivated in the EU-28, 11 times more land was taken from 2000 to 2018 (i.e. 780 km2/yr of land taken, or a total of 14 049 km2 land taken vs. a total of 1 269 km2 of re-cultivated land). Although land take slowed in the EEA-39 region (Figure 1) during the period 2000-2018, when a total of 18 014 km2 of land was taken compared with 1 437 km2 of land re-cultivated, 12.5 times more land was taken than was re-cultivated.\nLand take intensity is calculated as the area of land converted to urban areas (artificial surfaces) as a percentage of the total urban area in the year 2000. In the EU-28, land take intensity in the period 2000-2018 was 6.7 % of the area of artificial surfaces in 2000. The intensity of urban sprawl decreased from 2.9 % between 2000 and 2006 to 1.5 % between 2012-2018. In the EEA-39 region during the period 2000-2018, 7.7 % of the total urban area expanded to cover agricultural and semi-natural areas (1 percentage point more than in the EU-28).\nWhile land take was concentrated around large urban agglomerations between 2000 and 2018, there was a change in the spatial distribution of land take processes during the various observation periods (Figure 2). Between 2000 and 2006, land take was greatest in the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and Albania, and around the capital regions of Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain. From 2006 to 2012, land take in the coastal regions and in the United Kingdom did not increase significantly, while significant land take emerged in Poland following large highways and in Turkey in a scattered pattern. Between 2012 and 2018, land take was remarkably low in the Iberian Peninsula, but it increased again in Turkey and peaked in the United Kingdom.\nSee the interactive Land take data viewer for more details.\nIn the EU-28, 78 % of land take occurred on agricultural areas (i.e. arable land and pastures, and mosaic farmlands (see the interactive Land take data viewer)) between 2000 and 2018. Of this, 50.5 % of land take was concentrated on arable lands and permanent crops, 27.2 % happened on pastures and mosaic farmlands, 14.3 % showed urban expansion into forests and transitional woodlands, and 6 % was into grasslands.\nLand take intensity varied between the various land cover types during the 18 year period: the intensity of urban areas expanding into arable lands and into pastures and mosaic farmlands steadily decreased. From 2000 to 2006, 1.4 % of urban areas expanded into arable lands, decreasing to 0.8 % between 2012 and 2018. The percentage of urban sprawl converted into pastures and mosaic farmlands decreased from 0.9 % between 2000 and 2006 to 0.4 % during the period 2012-2018. Land take intensity was low and remained stable over forests and grasslands during this time. The spread of urban areas into forests and grasslands was below 0.5 % and below 0.3%, respectively, during all periods.\nIn the EU-28, between 2000 and 2018, 394 km2/yr of arable land, 212 km2/yr of pastures and mosaic farmlands, 111.7 km2/yr of forests and transitional woodlands, and 48 km2/yr of grasslands were converted to urban areas (see the interactive Land take data viewer). This is equal to 0.6 % of arable land lost during the period 2000-2018 (compared with the land cover area in 2000). Urban sprawl converted 0.5 % of pastures and mosaic farmlands and 0.3 % of grasslands into artificial surfaces. Forests were comparably stable as only 0.1 % of the total forested area in 2000 was converted to urban areas.\nFig. 5: Land take intensity within NUTS3 regions\nNote:\nThe intensity of land take is calculated as land take in the given period as a percentage of the area of artificial surfaces in 2000.

This helps to compare countries of different sizes. For more information see the interactive Land take data viewer. Land take during those 18 years was especially high in Cyprus, the Netherlands and Albania. With a yearly land take of 940 m2/km2, the impact of urban sprawl on Cyprus was the greatest in Europe. Its land take intensity (i.e. land take as a percentage of artificial surfaces in 2000) was 21 %.\nConverting land to urban areas with a yearly rate of 894 m2/km2 and a 19 % increase compared with 2000, land take in the Netherlands was also significantly higher than in other European countries. Yearly land take in Albania was somewhat lower (586 m2/km2) but compared with 2000, the 56 % increase in artificial surfaces in Albania was the largest in the EEA-39. Denmark was the only Nordic country with a high yearly land take. The other Scandinavian countries, together with Switzerland and Latvia, and Slovenia and Bulgaria in southern Europe had the lowest annual rate of land take of less than 65 m2/km2.\nIn the most recent observation period (2012-2018), the proportion of areas converted to urban land in Malta was the largest in Europe, with a yearly rate of 486 m2/km2. While between 2000 and 2018, the United Kingdom's land take was in line with that of other European countries, it was the second highest in Europe in the period 2012-2018. During the 2012-2018 observation period Cyprus, Luxembourg and the Netherlands kept converting significantly higher amounts of land to urban areas than other countries. They were joined by Turkey where a strong land take was also observed. With a yearly rate of above 312 m2/km2 (411 m2/km2 in the case of Cyprus), these countries exceeded recent land take rates elsewhere in Europe.\nAlthough Luxembourg had one of the highest land takes in Europe between 2000 and 2018, the re-cultivation of urban areas to semi-natural land was also the highest there, with a yearly rate of 82 m2/km2. In the last observation period (2012-2018), both the Netherlands and Luxembourg increased their re-cultivation of land to around 90 m2/km2, along with the UK and Belgium, for which the figure was around 70 m2/km2.\nThe land take indicator address the change in the area of agricultural, forest and other semi-natural land taken for urban and other artificial land development.

This is, in particular, the case for discontinuous urban fabric, which is considered as a whole. Similarly, monitoring the indicator with satellite images leads to the exclusion of most linear transport infrastructures, which are too narrow to be observed directly.\nThe units of measurement used in this indicator are km2.\nResults are presented as the change in the proportion of the area of the country (m2/km2) and as the percentage (%) and area (km2) of the various land cover types taken by urban development.\nThe 7th EAP and the EU Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe promote \u2018No Net Land Take\u2019 in the EU by 2050, aiming to mitigate the effect of urban sprawl. \u2018No Net Land Take\u2019 is addressed in the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) target of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), aiming to maintain the amount and quality of land resources. LDN is promoted by Target 15.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which, by 2030, strives to combat desertification and to restore degraded land and soil. Land and soil are also bound to goals that address poverty reduction (SDG 1), health and well-being through reduced pollution (SDG 3), access to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), the environmental impact of urban sprawl (SDG 11) and climate change (SDG 13). The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 calls for restoring at least 15 % of degraded ecosystems in the Union and expanding the use of Green Infrastructure, e.g. to help overcome land fragmentation.\nPolicy decisions that shape land use involve trade-offs between many sectoral interests, including industry, transport, energy, mining, agriculture and forestry. These trade-offs are eventually implemented through spatial planning and land management in the Member States. Although the subsidiarity principle assigns land and urban planning responsibilities to national and regional government levels, most European policies have a direct or indirect effect on urban development. In particular, the effective implementation of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directives has shown that they can improve the consideration of environmental aspects in planning projects, plans and programmes, contribute to more systematic and transparent planning and improve participation and consultation. The far-reaching consequences of European and other policies for spatial impacts are, however, only partially perceived and understood. Tackling these challenges needs the completion of a comprehensive knowledge base and better awareness of the complexity of the problems as currently expressed in the discussion on a \u2018territorial impact assessment\u2019 instrument (Territorial, 2010). Initiatives towards such an integrated approach, as requested in the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion 2007\u20132013 (COM(2005)0229), imply compliance with the precautionary principle, the efficient use of natural resources and the minimisation of waste and pollution, and need to be vigorously pursued and, in particular, implemented.\nAt the European level, the 1999 European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP), a non-binding framework that aims to coordinate various European regional policy impacts, already advocates the development of a sustainable, polycentric and balanced urban system with compact cities, and the strengthening of the partnerships between urban and rural areas; parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge; and wise management of natural areas and cultural heritage. The 2008 Green Paper on territorial cohesion and the 2007 EU Territorial Agenda and Action Plan by the Territorial Agenda of the EU and the Action programme for its implementation (COPTA, 2007) build further on the ESDP. Specific actions relevant in the field of \u2018Land\u2019, in particular are action 2.1d: \u2018Urban sprawl\u2019 and action 2.2 \u2018Territorial impact of EU policies\u2019.\nThe importance of multi-functional land is also massively reinforced by the emerging policy and scientific consensus on the importance of land management practices for mitigating and adapting to climate change, as stated by the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change Activities on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). However, it may often be difficult to estimate greenhouse gas removals by, and emissions from land use and forestry resulting from LULUCF activities (UNFCCC). EU climate change policy addresses land use in its White paper for climate change and adaptation, using measures aimed at increasing the resilience of land-based production and ecosystems in general (COM(2009)469).\nWhile many European and national policies address land and soil to some extent, binding targets, incentives and measures are largely missing at the European level. The European Court of Auditors recommends to establish methodologies and a legal framework to assess land degradation and desertification, and to support the Member States to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030 (ECA, 2018).\nAlthough, there are no quantitative targets for land take for urban development at the European level, different documents reflect the need for better planning to control urban growth and the extension of infrastructures (policies relating explicitly to land use issues, and especially physical and spatial planning, have generally been the responsibility of the authorities in Member States). The European Commission's Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 571) introduces for the first time a 'no net land take by 2050' initiative that would imply that all new urbanisation will either occur on brown-fields or that any new land take will need to be compensated by reclamation of artificial land.\nMeeting the 7th EAP objective for no net land take by 2050 would require investments in land recycling, as well as halting land take. Land recycling is one way to achieve a growing urban population that consumes less land per capita. Land recycling can be achieved by constructing between buildings (densification), by constructing on brownfields (i.e. already used sites, known as grey recycling), or converting developed land into green areas (green recycling) (EEA, 2018b). Setting up green infrastructure is an important means to re-establish and maintain unsealed areas, thus to allow patches and networks of urban ecosystems to function in more sustainable cities (Chapter 3 and Chapter 17 for the role of green infrastructure). However, currently there is no legal framework or incentive to recycle urban land, despite available funding for land rehabilitation under the EU Cohesion Policy.\nDemand for new urban areas may be partly satisfied by brown-field remediation. Its environmental advantages are clear: relieving pressure on rural areas and green-field sites, reducing pollution costs, more efficient energy use and natural resource consumption, facilitating economic diversification and emerging habitat (housing) requirements. Europe has several examples of regional strategies for economic regeneration and brown-field development (The OECD Territorial Outlook 2001) and the recycling of artificial surfaces in several countries reaching 30 % or more if compared with the total land take area (CORINE Land Cover 2006 results). Stronger links between EU urban and soil policies could encourage this further.\nDECISION No 1386/2013/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 November 2013 on a General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 \u2018Living well, within the limits of our planet\u2019.

COM(2011) 571\nDECISION No 1600/2002/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme\nThe indicator is currently calculated from the Corine Land Cover Accounting Layers for the years 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers#tab-european-data ). Changes from agricultural (CLC class 2xx), forest and semi-natural/natural land (CLC class 3xx), wetlands (CLC class 4xx) or water (CLC 5xx) to urban areas (CLC class 1xx) are grouped according to the following methodology:\nLand take = LCF2 (21+22) + LCF3 (31+32+33+34+35+36+37+38) + LCF13 (development of green urban areas over previously undeveloped land) - part of LCF38 (conversion of sport and leisure facilities from previously developed land).\nFor the Land Cover Flow (LCF) descriptions, see the table below. Net land take is calculated taking into account the 'reverse land take process', i.e. when urban areas are converted to semi-natural land. This can happen as, for example, land cover changes from mineral extraction site to forest. Net land take is hence the result of land take minus reverse land take.\nDefinition of the Land take indicator explained with Corine Land Cover changes included:\nNot applicable\nBoth for facilitating computation and visualising spatial change, land accounts are processed using a grid of 1x1 km. Each cell contains the exact Corine Land Cover values but spatial aggregations are made of entire grid cells, which may lead to some very limited marginal uncertainty for the border of a given national or regional land unit.\nCorine Land Cover maps the extension of urban systems that may include parcels not covered by construction, streets or other sealed surfaces. This is particularly the case for discontinuous urban fabric and recreation areas. Furthermore, monitoring the indicator with satellite images leads to the exclusion of small urban features in the countryside and most of the linear transport infrastructures, which are too narrow to be observed directly. Therefore, differences might exist between Corine Land Cover derived results and other statistics collected with different methodologies such as point or area sampling or farm surveys. This is often the case for agriculture and forest statistics. In the future, gaps will be filled using a new high-resolution database of transport infrastructure and calculations based on established coefficients for each type of transport.\nNewly urbanised areas (land uptake) may also comprise non-artificial surfaces (private gardens or public green areas). Thus, there may be variations in their environmental conditions and provision of habitats or ecosystem services.\n21 Apr 2017 - Land take\n24 Jun 2013 - Land take\n21 Feb 2011 - Land take\n08 Nov 2005 - Land take\n2000-2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 01:18 PM\nFiled under: land cover land use copernicus corine land cover\nDPSIR: Pressure\nTypology: Descriptive indicator (Type A - What is happening to the environment and to humans?)\nIndicator codes\n- CSI 014\n- LSI 001\nFrequency of updates\nUpdates are scheduled every 6 years\nEEA Contact Info info@eea.europa.eu\nFiled under: land cover, land use, copernicus corine land cover\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Land take during those 18 years was especially high in Cyprus, the Netherlands and Albania. With a yearly land take of 940 m2/km2, the impact of urban sprawl on Cyprus was the greatest in Europe. Its land take intensity (i.e. land take as a percentage of artificial surfaces in 2000) was 21 %.\nConverting land to urban areas with a yearly rate of 894 m2/km2 and a 19 % increase compared with 2000, land take in the Netherlands was also significantly higher than in other European countries. Yearly land take in Albania was somewhat lower (586 m2/km2) but compared with 2000, the 56 % increase in artificial surfaces in Albania was the largest in the EEA-39. Denmark was the only Nordic country with a high yearly land take. The other Scandinavian countries, together with Switzerland and Latvia, and Slovenia and Bulgaria in southern Europe had the lowest annual rate of land take of less than 65 m2/km2.\nIn the most recent observation period (2012-2018), the proportion of areas converted to urban land in Malta was the largest in Europe, with a yearly rate of 486 m2/km2. While between 2000 and 2018, the United Kingdom's land take was in line with that of other European countries, it was the second highest in Europe in the period 2012-2018. During the 2012-2018 observation period Cyprus, Luxembourg and the Netherlands kept converting significantly higher amounts of land to urban areas than other countries. They were joined by Turkey where a strong land take was also observed. With a yearly rate of above 312 m2/km2 (411 m2/km2 in the case of Cyprus), these countries exceeded recent land take rates elsewhere in Europe.\nAlthough Luxembourg had one of the highest land takes in Europe between 2000 and 2018, the re-cultivation of urban areas to semi-natural land was also the highest there, with a yearly rate of 82 m2/km2. In the last observation period (2012-2018), both the Netherlands and Luxembourg increased their re-cultivation of land to around 90 m2/km2, along with the UK and Belgium, for which the figure was around 70 m2/km2.\nThe land take indicator address the change in the area of agricultural, forest and other semi-natural land taken for urban and other artificial land development.

LDN is promoted by Target 15.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which, by 2030, strives to combat desertification and to restore degraded land and soil. Land and soil are also bound to goals that address poverty reduction (SDG 1), health and well-being through reduced pollution (SDG 3), access to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), the environmental impact of urban sprawl (SDG 11) and climate change (SDG 13). The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 calls for restoring at least 15 % of degraded ecosystems in the Union and expanding the use of Green Infrastructure, e.g. to help overcome land fragmentation.\nPolicy decisions that shape land use involve trade-offs between many sectoral interests, including industry, transport, energy, mining, agriculture and forestry. These trade-offs are eventually implemented through spatial planning and land management in the Member States. Although the subsidiarity principle assigns land and urban planning responsibilities to national and regional government levels, most European policies have a direct or indirect effect on urban development. In particular, the effective implementation of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directives has shown that they can improve the consideration of environmental aspects in planning projects, plans and programmes, contribute to more systematic and transparent planning and improve participation and consultation. The far-reaching consequences of European and other policies for spatial impacts are, however, only partially perceived and understood. Tackling these challenges needs the completion of a comprehensive knowledge base and better awareness of the complexity of the problems as currently expressed in the discussion on a \u2018territorial impact assessment\u2019 instrument (Territorial, 2010). Initiatives towards such an integrated approach, as requested in the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion 2007\u20132013 (COM(2005)0229), imply compliance with the precautionary principle, the efficient use of natural resources and the minimisation of waste and pollution, and need to be vigorously pursued and, in particular, implemented.\nAt the European level, the 1999 European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP), a non-binding framework that aims to coordinate various European regional policy impacts, already advocates the development of a sustainable, polycentric and balanced urban system with compact cities, and the strengthening of the partnerships between urban and rural areas; parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge; and wise management of natural areas and cultural heritage. The 2008 Green Paper on territorial cohesion and the 2007 EU Territorial Agenda and Action Plan by the Territorial Agenda of the EU and the Action programme for its implementation (COPTA, 2007) build further on the ESDP. Specific actions relevant in the field of \u2018Land\u2019, in particular are action 2.1d: \u2018Urban sprawl\u2019 and action 2.2 \u2018Territorial impact of EU policies\u2019.\nThe importance of multi-functional land is also massively reinforced by the emerging policy and scientific consensus on the importance of land management practices for mitigating and adapting to climate change, as stated by the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change Activities on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). However, it may often be difficult to estimate greenhouse gas removals by, and emissions from land use and forestry resulting from LULUCF activities (UNFCCC). EU climate change policy addresses land use in its White paper for climate change and adaptation, using measures aimed at increasing the resilience of land-based production and ecosystems in general (COM(2009)469).\nWhile many European and national policies address land and soil to some extent, binding targets, incentives and measures are largely missing at the European level. The European Court of Auditors recommends to establish methodologies and a legal framework to assess land degradation and desertification, and to support the Member States to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030 (ECA, 2018).\nAlthough, there are no quantitative targets for land take for urban development at the European level, different documents reflect the need for better planning to control urban growth and the extension of infrastructures (policies relating explicitly to land use issues, and especially physical and spatial planning, have generally been the responsibility of the authorities in Member States). The European Commission's Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 571) introduces for the first time a 'no net land take by 2050' initiative that would imply that all new urbanisation will either occur on brown-fields or that any new land take will need to be compensated by reclamation of artificial land.\nMeeting the 7th EAP objective for no net land take by 2050 would require investments in land recycling, as well as halting land take. Land recycling is one way to achieve a growing urban population that consumes less land per capita. Land recycling can be achieved by constructing between buildings (densification), by constructing on brownfields (i.e. already used sites, known as grey recycling), or converting developed land into green areas (green recycling) (EEA, 2018b). Setting up green infrastructure is an important means to re-establish and maintain unsealed areas, thus to allow patches and networks of urban ecosystems to function in more sustainable cities (Chapter 3 and Chapter 17 for the role of green infrastructure). However, currently there is no legal framework or incentive to recycle urban land, despite available funding for land rehabilitation under the EU Cohesion Policy.\nDemand for new urban areas may be partly satisfied by brown-field remediation. Its environmental advantages are clear: relieving pressure on rural areas and green-field sites, reducing pollution costs, more efficient energy use and natural resource consumption, facilitating economic diversification and emerging habitat (housing) requirements. Europe has several examples of regional strategies for economic regeneration and brown-field development (The OECD Territorial Outlook 2001) and the recycling of artificial surfaces in several countries reaching 30 % or more if compared with the total land take area (CORINE Land Cover 2006 results). Stronger links between EU urban and soil policies could encourage this further.\nDECISION No 1386/2013/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 November 2013 on a General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 \u2018Living well, within the limits of our planet\u2019.

COM(2011) 571\nDECISION No 1600/2002/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme\nThe indicator is currently calculated from the Corine Land Cover Accounting Layers for the years 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers#tab-european-data ). Changes from agricultural (CLC class 2xx), forest and semi-natural/natural land (CLC class 3xx), wetlands (CLC class 4xx) or water (CLC 5xx) to urban areas (CLC class 1xx) are grouped according to the following methodology:\nLand take = LCF2 (21+22) + LCF3 (31+32+33+34+35+36+37+38) + LCF13 (development of green urban areas over previously undeveloped land) - part of LCF38 (conversion of sport and leisure facilities from previously developed land).\nFor the Land Cover Flow (LCF) descriptions, see the table below. Net land take is calculated taking into account the 'reverse land take process', i.e. when urban areas are converted to semi-natural land. This can happen as, for example, land cover changes from mineral extraction site to forest. Net land take is hence the result of land take minus reverse land take.\nDefinition of the Land take indicator explained with Corine Land Cover changes included:\nNot applicable\nBoth for facilitating computation and visualising spatial change, land accounts are processed using a grid of 1x1 km. Each cell contains the exact Corine Land Cover values but spatial aggregations are made of entire grid cells, which may lead to some very limited marginal uncertainty for the border of a given national or regional land unit.\nCorine Land Cover maps the extension of urban systems that may include parcels not covered by construction, streets or other sealed surfaces. This is particularly the case for discontinuous urban fabric and recreation areas. Furthermore, monitoring the indicator with satellite images leads to the exclusion of small urban features in the countryside and most of the linear transport infrastructures, which are too narrow to be observed directly. Therefore, differences might exist between Corine Land Cover derived results and other statistics collected with different methodologies such as point or area sampling or farm surveys. This is often the case for agriculture and forest statistics. In the future, gaps will be filled using a new high-resolution database of transport infrastructure and calculations based on established coefficients for each type of transport.\nNewly urbanised areas (land uptake) may also comprise non-artificial surfaces (private gardens or public green areas). Thus, there may be variations in their environmental conditions and provision of habitats or ecosystem services.\n21 Apr 2017 - Land take\n24 Jun 2013 - Land take\n21 Feb 2011 - Land take\n08 Nov 2005 - Land take\n2000-2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 02:18 PM\nFiled under: land cover land use copernicus corine land cover\nDPSIR: Pressure\nTypology: Descriptive indicator (Type A - What is happening to the environment and to humans?)\nIndicator codes\n- CSI 014\n- LSI 001\nFrequency of updates\nUpdates are scheduled every 6 years\nEEA Contact Info info@eea.europa.eu\nFiled under: land cover, land use, copernicus corine land cover\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

While some land was re-cultivated in the EU-28 in the period 2000-2018, 11 times more land was taken.\nBetween 2000 and 2018, 78 % of land take in the EU-28 affected agricultural areas, i.e. arable lands and pastures, and mosaic farmlands.\nFrom 2000 to 2018, land take consumed 0.6 % of all arable lands and permanent crops, 0.5 % of all pastures and mosaic farmlands, and 0.3 % of all grasslands into urban areas.\nIn proportion to their area, Cyprus, the Netherlands and Albania saw the largest amount of land take between 2000 and 2018.\nThe re-cultivation of land increased from 2012 to 2018, led by Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Belgium.\nThe main drivers of land take during 2000-2018 were industrial and commercial land use as well as extension of residential areas and construction sites.\nFig. 1: Land take during 2000-2018 and during the Corine Land Cover observation periods (2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2018)\nNote:\nFor visualisation purposes, the initial 100 m spatial resolution Corine Land Cover dataset was re-sampled to a 10 km2 grid.

This is, in particular, the case for discontinuous urban fabric, which is considered as a whole. Similarly, monitoring the indicator with satellite images leads to the exclusion of most linear transport infrastructures, which are too narrow to be observed directly.\nSee the interactive Land take data viewer for more details.\nThe indicator addresses the 7th Environment Action Programme target to reach 'no net land take by 2050' and the Land Degradation Neutrality target of the United Nations Development Goals (SDG 15.3).\nAlthough still claiming agricultural and semi-natural areas, average land take in the EU-28 slowed down in the period 2000-2018. Starting at 1 022 km2/yr between 2000 and 2006, land take had decreased to 860 km2/year by the period 2006-2012 and amounted to only 539 km\u00b2/year from 2012 to 2018 (interactive Land take data viewer). In some cases, artificial land was returned to other land categories (re-cultivation).\nThe balance between taken and re-cultivated land is net land take \u2014 the concept behind the EU \u2019no net land take\u2019 target (Figure 1). While some land was re-cultivated in the EU-28, 11 times more land was taken from 2000 to 2018 (i.e. 780 km2/yr of land taken, or a total of 14 049 km2 land taken vs. a total of 1 269 km2 of re-cultivated land). Although land take slowed in the EEA-39 region (Figure 1) during the period 2000-2018, when a total of 18 014 km2 of land was taken compared with 1 437 km2 of land re-cultivated, 12.5 times more land was taken than was re-cultivated.\nLand take intensity is calculated as the area of land converted to urban areas (artificial surfaces) as a percentage of the total urban area in the year 2000. In the EU-28, land take intensity in the period 2000-2018 was 6.7 % of the area of artificial surfaces in 2000. The intensity of urban sprawl decreased from 2.9 % between 2000 and 2006 to 1.5 % between 2012-2018. In the EEA-39 region during the period 2000-2018, 7.7 % of the total urban area expanded to cover agricultural and semi-natural areas (1 percentage point more than in the EU-28).\nWhile land take was concentrated around large urban agglomerations between 2000 and 2018, there was a change in the spatial distribution of land take processes during the various observation periods (Figure 2). Between 2000 and 2006, land take was greatest in the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and Albania, and around the capital regions of Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain. From 2006 to 2012, land take in the coastal regions and in the United Kingdom did not increase significantly, while significant land take emerged in Poland following large highways and in Turkey in a scattered pattern. Between 2012 and 2018, land take was remarkably low in the Iberian Peninsula, but it increased again in Turkey and peaked in the United Kingdom.\nSee the interactive Land take data viewer for more details.\nIn the EU-28, 78 % of land take occurred on agricultural areas (i.e. arable land and pastures, and mosaic farmlands (see the interactive Land take data viewer)) between 2000 and 2018. Of this, 50.5 % of land take was concentrated on arable lands and permanent crops, 27.2 % happened on pastures and mosaic farmlands, 14.3 % showed urban expansion into forests and transitional woodlands, and 6 % was into grasslands.\nLand take intensity varied between the various land cover types during the 18 year period: the intensity of urban areas expanding into arable lands and into pastures and mosaic farmlands steadily decreased. From 2000 to 2006, 1.4 % of urban areas expanded into arable lands, decreasing to 0.8 % between 2012 and 2018. The percentage of urban sprawl converted into pastures and mosaic farmlands decreased from 0.9 % between 2000 and 2006 to 0.4 % during the period 2012-2018. Land take intensity was low and remained stable over forests and grasslands during this time. The spread of urban areas into forests and grasslands was below 0.5 % and below 0.3%, respectively, during all periods.\nIn the EU-28, between 2000 and 2018, 394 km2/yr of arable land, 212 km2/yr of pastures and mosaic farmlands, 111.7 km2/yr of forests and transitional woodlands, and 48 km2/yr of grasslands were converted to urban areas (see the interactive Land take data viewer). This is equal to 0.6 % of arable land lost during the period 2000-2018 (compared with the land cover area in 2000). Urban sprawl converted 0.5 % of pastures and mosaic farmlands and 0.3 % of grasslands into artificial surfaces. Forests were comparably stable as only 0.1 % of the total forested area in 2000 was converted to urban areas.\nFig. 5: Land take intensity within NUTS3 regions\nNote:\nThe intensity of land take is calculated as land take in the given period as a percentage of the area of artificial surfaces in 2000.

Denmark was the only Nordic country with a high yearly land take. The other Scandinavian countries, together with Switzerland and Latvia, and Slovenia and Bulgaria in southern Europe had the lowest annual rate of land take of less than 65 m2/km2.\nIn the most recent observation period (2012-2018), the proportion of areas converted to urban land in Malta was the largest in Europe, with a yearly rate of 486 m2/km2.

The European Court of Auditors recommends to establish methodologies and a legal framework to assess land degradation and desertification, and to support the Member States to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030 (ECA, 2018).\nAlthough, there are no quantitative targets for land take for urban development at the European level, different documents reflect the need for better planning to control urban growth and the extension of infrastructures (policies relating explicitly to land use issues, and especially physical and spatial planning, have generally been the responsibility of the authorities in Member States). The European Commission's Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 571) introduces for the first time a 'no net land take by 2050' initiative that would imply that all new urbanisation will either occur on brown-fields or that any new land take will need to be compensated by reclamation of artificial land.\nMeeting the 7th EAP objective for no net land take by 2050 would require investments in land recycling, as well as halting land take. Land recycling is one way to achieve a growing urban population that consumes less land per capita. Land recycling can be achieved by constructing between buildings (densification), by constructing on brownfields (i.e. already used sites, known as grey recycling), or converting developed land into green areas (green recycling) (EEA, 2018b). Setting up green infrastructure is an important means to re-establish and maintain unsealed areas, thus to allow patches and networks of urban ecosystems to function in more sustainable cities (Chapter 3 and Chapter 17 for the role of green infrastructure). However, currently there is no legal framework or incentive to recycle urban land, despite available funding for land rehabilitation under the EU Cohesion Policy.\nDemand for new urban areas may be partly satisfied by brown-field remediation. Its environmental advantages are clear: relieving pressure on rural areas and green-field sites, reducing pollution costs, more efficient energy use and natural resource consumption, facilitating economic diversification and emerging habitat (housing) requirements. Europe has several examples of regional strategies for economic regeneration and brown-field development (The OECD Territorial Outlook 2001) and the recycling of artificial surfaces in several countries reaching 30 % or more if compared with the total land take area (CORINE Land Cover 2006 results). Stronger links between EU urban and soil policies could encourage this further.\nDECISION No 1386/2013/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 November 2013 on a General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 \u2018Living well, within the limits of our planet\u2019. In November 2013, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the 7 th EU Environment Action Programme to 2020 \u2018Living well, within the limits of our planet\u2019. This programme is intended to help guide EU action on the environment and climate change up to and beyond 2020 based on the following vision: \u2018In 2050, we live well, within the planet\u2019s ecological limits. Our prosperity and healthy environment stem from an innovative, circular economy where nothing is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably, and biodiversity is protected, valued and restored in ways that enhance our society\u2019s resilience.

COM(2011) 571\nDECISION No 1600/2002/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme\nThe indicator is currently calculated from the Corine Land Cover Accounting Layers for the years 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers#tab-european-data ). Changes from agricultural (CLC class 2xx), forest and semi-natural/natural land (CLC class 3xx), wetlands (CLC class 4xx) or water (CLC 5xx) to urban areas (CLC class 1xx) are grouped according to the following methodology:\nLand take = LCF2 (21+22) + LCF3 (31+32+33+34+35+36+37+38) + LCF13 (development of green urban areas over previously undeveloped land) - part of LCF38 (conversion of sport and leisure facilities from previously developed land).\nFor the Land Cover Flow (LCF) descriptions, see the table below. Net land take is calculated taking into account the 'reverse land take process', i.e. when urban areas are converted to semi-natural land. This can happen as, for example, land cover changes from mineral extraction site to forest. Net land take is hence the result of land take minus reverse land take.\nDefinition of the Land take indicator explained with Corine Land Cover changes included:\nNot applicable\nBoth for facilitating computation and visualising spatial change, land accounts are processed using a grid of 1x1 km. Each cell contains the exact Corine Land Cover values but spatial aggregations are made of entire grid cells, which may lead to some very limited marginal uncertainty for the border of a given national or regional land unit.\nCorine Land Cover maps the extension of urban systems that may include parcels not covered by construction, streets or other sealed surfaces. This is particularly the case for discontinuous urban fabric and recreation areas. Furthermore, monitoring the indicator with satellite images leads to the exclusion of small urban features in the countryside and most of the linear transport infrastructures, which are too narrow to be observed directly. Therefore, differences might exist between Corine Land Cover derived results and other statistics collected with different methodologies such as point or area sampling or farm surveys. This is often the case for agriculture and forest statistics. In the future, gaps will be filled using a new high-resolution database of transport infrastructure and calculations based on established coefficients for each type of transport.\nNewly urbanised areas (land uptake) may also comprise non-artificial surfaces (private gardens or public green areas). Thus, there may be variations in their environmental conditions and provision of habitats or ecosystem services.\n21 Apr 2017 - Land take\n24 Jun 2013 - Land take\n21 Feb 2011 - Land take\n08 Nov 2005 - Land take\n2000-2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 02:18 PM\nFiled under: land cover land use copernicus corine land cover\nDPSIR: Pressure\nTypology: Descriptive indicator (Type A - What is happening to the environment and to humans?)\nIndicator codes\n- CSI 014\n- LSI 001\nFrequency of updates\nUpdates are scheduled every 6 years\nEEA Contact Info info@eea.europa.eu\nFiled under: land cover, land use, copernicus corine land cover\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "ETC/ULS Report 02/2020 Land and ecosystem accounts for Europe. Towards geospatial environmental accounting30 Sep 2020\nLand use and land use change are fundamental for sustainable resource use and the delivery of ecosystem services, including the provision of food, nutrient cycling and climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. Land resources are part of our shared natural capital and must be well managed to maintain a healthy environment and human well-being. As such, only if land use and its impacts are properly addressed is progress towards sustainable development in Europe possible. Land-use related policies require the development of harmonised datasets, transparent methodologies and easily interpretable statistics.

Land use and associated changes influence the integrity of ecosystems and our \nnatural capital, which in turn are directly associated to a healthy environment and human wellbeing. \n \nIn order to support and guide policy actions acting between economy and environment, \nharmonized datasets, transparent methodologies and easily interpretable statistics are essential \nelements. The complex interaction between elements of natural capital also calls for a coherent \napproach to facilitate the understanding of the coupled human-environment system. Therefore, \nmonitoring of the structure and condition of ecosystems and their trends, along with properly \nagreed methodologies are urgently needed. \n \nLand and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC) is an EEA initiative which is part of EEA`s geospatial \nenvironmental accounting system. Methods are in line with the framework of the UN System of \nEnvironmental Economic Accounting - Central Framework (SEEA-CF 2012), which provides \ninternationally agreed standards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the \neconomy. The EEA LEAC approach also supports the calculation of ecosystem accounts as \nproposed by the guidance issued by the United Nations Statistics Department on \u2018Experimental \nEcosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA1). This provides opportunity for an integrated measurement \nof trends for individual environmental assets within a given spatial area as proposed by the \nEcosystem Natural Capital Accounts (ENCA) framework (UN-CBD, 2014). \n \nThe present report describes EEA`s approach for producing land accounts using geospatial data \nand providing statistical information in land cover and land use status and changes. After the \nintroduction of the accounting concept, EEA`s accounting infrastructure, the Joint \nEnvironmental Data Infrastructure together with its data cube concept are presented. The \nreport then describes the Corine Land Cover dataset which presently serves as a basis for the \nlong-term land accounting reports of the EEA. This is followed by the presentation of interactive \ndashboards to illustrate how accounting statistics can be brought to the user. Finally, the land \naccounting method is explained on the basis of examples for agricultural land use, forested land \nand urban areas. \n \nThe concepts and methods presented in this report are flexible and may be used with any \ncategorical geospatial data.

Understanding the status and change of land cover and land use and its impact on natural capital \nis therefore required by many policy processes. This is clearly stated in the 7th Environmental Action \nProgramme of the European Union (7th EAP), in particular under Priority 1 on \u2018Maintaining natural capital\u2019 \nand Priority 5 which sets targets to increase the knowledge about environment and widen the evidence \nbase for policy. While the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 already formulated the need for an integration of \ngeospatial data, the new EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 repeats this need implicitly in the context of the \nnew EU Nature Restoration Plan and by the intent to put in place a monitoring and review mechanism, \nincluding a clear set of indicators.  \n \nLand cover and land use status and change are important elements to inform the development and \nimplementation of policies that deal with the management of our land resources, such as agriculture, \nforestry, biodiversity and climate policies or regional planning. Land cover status and change statistics are \nalso needed to address the \u201cno net land take\u201d by 2050 target of the 7th EAP. An integrated management \nof natural capital is also a key target of other EU environmental policies, such as those on nature (i.e. Birds \nand Habitats Directives), water (Water Framework Directive) and marine (Marine Strategy Framework \nDirective) which are also aiming at integration with sectoral policies and a broader assessment of systemic \nchallenges regarding ecosystem management.  \n \nAlthough a binding legislative mechanism for the sustainable management of land at the level of the \nEuropean Union (EU) is lacking (Frelih-Larsen et al., 2017), the sustainable management of land is crucial \nto ensure that land continues to provide its functions now and in the future. Some EU policies already \nframe conditions for land use, e.g. the Common Agricultural Policy. Others will affect it increasingly in the \ncoming years, including a new EU regulation for land-based carbon accounting (land-use, land-use change \nand forestry - LULUCF) and EU renewable energy and climate goals. At the same time a wide range of EU \nenvironmental policies have a major stake in land management, for example the EU Biodiversity Strategy \nwith its target to \u2018maintain and restore ecosystems and their services\u2019 (Land system concept, EEA, 2018). \n \nAt international level, with the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2016, European \ncountries, which are party to the UNCCD, and the EU have committed themselves to implement \u2018Land \nDegradation Neutrality\u2019 (LDN) in their mandate areas in the period up to 2030. The corresponding SDG \ntarget is target 15 on land to \u201cprotect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, \nsustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt \nbiodiversity loss\u201d. Moreover, the SDG target 15.9 postulates \u201cBy 2020, integrate ecosystem and \nbiodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies \nand accounts\u201d. The international System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a key reporting \nframework for these targets and for a better ecosystem management in general. It comprises inter alia \n                                                           \n(2)  https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf \n\nhttps://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsdg.humanrights.dk%2Fen%2Ftargets2%3Ftarget%3D15.9&data=02%7C01%7CEva.Ivits-Wasser%40eea.europa.eu%7Cb03e82deb63049d179f708d7b94611b7%7Cbe2e7beab4934de5bbc58b4a6a235600%7C1%7C0%7C637181582902436887&sdata=MtU7vXEQiUGRimTUauI4ngarz0z7EM63n976kkJayjA%3D&reserved=0\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 2 \n\nstandards on land and water accounting, published in the \u2018Central Framework\u2019 (SEEA CF), and guidance on \necosystem accounting (SEEA EEA), which will be updated by 2021.  \n \n\n1.2  Monitoring of land and ecosystems as natural capital \n\n \n\u00a9 Nunzio Santisi, Picture2050 /EEA; \u00a9 Lisa Douglas, NATURE@work /EEA; \u00a9 Charles Garnett, Picture2050 /EEA; \n\n \nThe natural capital (next to manufactured, human and social capitals) provides the basic conditions for \nhuman existence (SOER EEA, 2015). It is divided into two main components: ecosystem capital and abiotic \ncomponents. Different components of natural capital can be classified according to a number of criteria, \ne.g. whether they depletable, able to self-regenerate, resilient etc. Ecosystem capital is generally \nconsidered to be the most vulnerable (EEA, 2019). Productive land and fertile soil are part of our shared \nnatural capital. Appropriate management of land and soil is therefore fundamental for sustainable \nresource use and the delivery of ecosystem services (SOER, 2020).  \n \nThe complex interactions between different elements of natural capital and human society calls for a \ncoherent approach to understand the coupled human-environment system. Land use and its change \nimpact food security, carbon cycling, and water cycles, among others. Land use and changes influence the \nintegrity of ecosystems and our natural capital, which in turn underpin a wide range of ecosystem services \nand ultimately human well-being. In order to understand and tackle anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems \nspatially explicit information on the extent and changes of land and associated ecosystems is a crucial \npiece of knowledge. This monitoring must be supported by quantitative, robust, reliable and comparable \nmethods to map the condition and degradation of ecosystems and their services and thus supplying a \nstandardized framework for ecosystem assessment and accounting.  \n \nIn the EU, the analysis of the links between natural capital and human economy and well-being is \nsupported by the EU INCA project and the MAES initiative (Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and \ntheir Services) under the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. This initiative brings together EU bodies and \nMember State organisations to map and assess European ecosystems and their services based on a \nconceptual framework for EU-wide ecosystem assessment. The analytical goal is to measure the state of \nbiodiversity and ecosystems and to evaluate the level of ecosystem services provided to people. This would \nshow the connections between the environment and the economy (economic sectors) by considering the \necosystems from which the services are derived and the different benefits to human society that are \naffected by changes in the supply of services (Maes et al., 2013). \n  \n\f\n \n\n3 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n1.3  Land and ecosystems in the accounting framework \n\n \n\u00a9 Hari Subash, Picture2050 /EEA; \u00a9 Tamara Radusinovic, Picture2050 /EEA; \u00a9 Antonio Sicuro, Picture2050 /EEA  \n\n \nLand and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC), is an EEA initiative aiming to build and apply a European \naccounting system for land and ecosystems (EEA, 2006). This work builds on the framework of the UN \nSystem of Environmental Economic Accounting - Central Framework (SEEA-CF, 2012), which provides \ninternationally agreed standards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. \nTogether with the Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA3) these methods integrate individual \nenvironmental assets within a given spatial area. The support that the LEAC approach provides for \necosystem accounting is described in the \u2018Quick start package for Ecosystem Natural Capital Accounts\u2019 \n(ENCA- CBD, 2014). Additional work of the EEA on ecosystem accounts, water accounts, pilot marine \naccounts etc. is set out in EEA report No 26/2018 (EEA, 2019).  \n \nWork on environmental accounts in the European Union is based on EU Regulation No 691/2011 on \nEuropean Environmental economic accounts 4 . This is complemented by the European strategy for \nenvironmental accounts for 2019 to 2023 5  which is a programme of further work agreed by the \nCommission (Eurostat) and the Member States and adopted by the European Statistical System \nCommittee. This strategy coordinates European efforts and paves the way for possible new modules. The \nEU-level INCA project (Commission, 2019) is a cooperation between several partners in the European \nCommission and the EEA to test and implement a system for integrated natural capital accounting within \nthe SEEA-EEA. Together with ongoing initiatives at country-level they provide a platform for the further \ndevelopment of ecosystem accounting within the EU statistical system. \n \nThe European LEAC database provides the basis for European land accounts. It quantifies the land cover \nextent as stocks and changes (increase and decrease in the extent) as flows between one time-step to \nanother. The LEAC database is based on the Copernicus CORINE Land Cover data series available for every \n6 years between 2000 and 2018 (https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover). The first \nEU 1990-2000 land accounts using the LEAC database were produced for 24 countries by the EEA on the \nbasis of CORINE Land Cover data. They have been updated for 2006, 2012, as well as for 2018 (for the 39 \nEEA countries) in 2019.  \n \nAdditionally, the LEAC database was adopted as the common starting point to generate European \necosystem extent accounts in the EU projects MAES and INCA. Ecosystem extent accounts use the same \nlogic as land accounts to quantify the extent and magnitude of change of different ecosystem types, in \nvarious spatial aggregations (e.g. Natura 2000 areas). The reclassification of CLC classes is based on the \nMAES ecosystem typology (tier I) and a hierarchical selection of CLC class groupings and individual level 3 \nclasses (tier II and tier III) to generate ecosystem extent accounts for 2000, 2006, and 2012 (Natural Capital \nAccounting, EEA, 2019), and for 2018 updated in 2020. \n\n                                                           \n(3)  https://seea.un.org/ \n(4)  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011R0691-20140616 \n(5)  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1798247/6191525/European+Strategy+ \n\nfor+Environmental+Accounts/ \n\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 4 \n\n1.4  An efficient land and ecosystem accounting system \n \nThe development of the EEA land and ecosystem accounting system began nearly two decades ago with \nfull methodological documentation of the approach published with the report \u2018Land accounts for Europe \n1990 \u2013 2000\u2019 (EEA, 2006). Since that period the EEA has published various other land and ecosystem \naccounting reports and accounting data bases.  \n \nAt the same time the need to better manage land and ecosystem resources is as pressing as ever, and the \npressures on our natural capital from climate change, biodiversity loss and socio-economic trends are only \nincreasing. Fortunately, our capacity to monitor trends in natural capital via earth observation is also \nincreasing, in particular via the EU Copernicus programme. This requires the development and \nimplementation of a more efficient land and ecosystem accounting system to connect policy information \nneeds with adequate analytical tools. \n \nThis document is one of several released by the EEA and ETC/ULS in 2020 to document the methodological \nand analytical advances in the EEA land and ecosystem accounting system. It focuses on the describing the \ndata foundation and the accounting infrastructure that underpins the efficient geo-spatial accounting tools \nemployed by EEA and ETC/ULS. This is complemented by illustrative examples of how land accounting \nmethods can support the analysis of environmental pressures arising from land use sectors and land use \nchange. Like the earliest EEA outputs in this domain, this publication is meant to document accounting \nmethods developed at the EEA in support of ongoing international processes that aim to develop coherent \nglobal frameworks, methods and standards for land and ecosystem accounting, in particular within the UN \nsystem of environmental-economic accounting (see above). \n  \n\f\n \n\n5 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n2 Methodological background \n\n2.1  Introduction  \n\n \n\u00a9 Sarah Van den Heuvel, NATURE@work EEA; \u00a9 Vyacheslav Popov, NATURE@work EEA; \u00a9 Eleni Alexiou, NATURE@work EEA \n\n \nThe previous section has described the environmental and policy context for land and ecosystem \naccounting and introduced the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting which provides the \noverall methodological frame for the work described in this report. A summary description of the SEEA \nframework can be found in the recent EEA report on \u2018Natural capital accounting in support of policy \nmaking\u2019 (EEA, 2019). Earlier EEA reports have reviewed the use of the land accounting method for tracking \nlandscape scale changes (\u2018Landscapes in transition\u2019 - EEA, 2017) and described the logic and \nmethodological detail of EEA land accounts (EEA, 2006). The latter report provides a comprehensive and \nstill relevant description of the set-up of the EEA land and ecosystem accounting approach. It also contains \na detailed description of the land cover flow matrix which has been reviewed and brought up-to-date \nduring the last two years. This limited update of the land cover flow matrix has been implemented in the \nEEA land and ecosystem accounting dashboards during the summer of 2020 and is described in this \nchapter. \n \nThis chapter presents key concepts and terms which are part of the land accounting approach (section \n2.2), reviews the main land cover groupings that underpin the LEAC approach (section 2.3) and describes \nthe revised land cover flow matrix (section 2.4).  \n\n2.2  Key concepts and terms of land and ecosystem accounting \n \nAccounting: Accounting is a term related to the financial world which refers to the systematic process of \nidentifying, recording, measuring, classifying, verifying, summarizing, interpreting and communicating \nfinancial information. It reveals profit or loss for a given period, and the value and nature of a firm's assets, \nliabilities and owners' equity6. \n \nLEAC: LEAC stands for Land and Ecosystem Accounting, a system that was developed by the EEA as a \ncontribution to the UN\u2019s Integrated System of Environmental and Economic Accounting7. It began with \nland cover accounts and is meant to be complemented by land use accounts (in linkage to social and \neconomic functions). The EEA LEAC approach also supports the development and calculation of European \necosystem extent accounts and the recording of ecosystem trends under the EU MAES project. \n \nLand (cover) accounting: In the case of land accounting, what is accounted for is the area occupied by each \nland cover class over time, including gains, losses and transfers or flows between LC classes. Land accounts, \nlike those for other types of environmental assets, seek to describe how resource stocks change over time \nin a consistent and systematic way. By doing this, the implications of those changes can better be \nunderstood. The cover of land is not, however, simply an attribute or quality of land, but a concrete set of \nnatural and anthropogenic features that largely results from its use. A given land cover can be modified, \ndegraded or destroyed (consumed) and a new type generated. As such, the consumption and formation \n\n                                                           \n(6)  Business dictionary (http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting.html) \n(7)  https://seea.un.org/content/land-accounts \n\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting.html\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 6 \n\nof land cover is very similar to the transformation of capital goods in the economy. Since land cannot, in \ngeneral terms, be created or destroyed (with the notable exceptions such as coastal erosion and \naccretion), land cover change can generally be characterised in terms of different types of flows between \nland cover types (EEA, 2006). \n \n\n\uf0b7 Consumption: it is understood as the loss of a specific land cover class by conversion to any other \nclasses over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Formation: it is understood as the gain of a specific land cover class by conversion from any other \nclasses over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Balance: the difference between formation and consumption for a specific land cover class over \ntime. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Turnover: the amount of change over time.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 Land cover stock: the amount of land cover existing at a specific time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Land cover change: a specific transition from one land cover class to another over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Land cover flow: a set of land cover changes grouped by a specific process by which those changes \nhave occurred. \n \n\n\uf0b7 CLC accounting layers: specific land cover stock layers made for the purpose of accounting. They are \nbuilt from the CLC stock layers and the CLC change layers over time. Due to the different MMU \nbetween CLC stock (25 ha) and change (5 ha) layers, the stock and change layers are combined into \nthe CLC accounting layers product. Further details are provided in Chapter 3. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LEAC codes: alternative land cover coding suitable for accounting purposes. The equivalences \nbetween CLC and LEAC codes are provided in Table 2-1. \n \n\n\uf0b7 MAES codes: alternative land cover coding developed for accounting for MAES purposes. The \nequivalences between CLC and MAES codes are provided in Table 2-2. \n \n\n\uf0b7 JEDI: Joint Environmental Data Infrastructure.

CLC level 3 as the most detailed level has 44 \nclasses, there are 15 intermediate classes at level 2 and five broad classes at level 1. Accounting for land \ncover change can in principle be implemented for individual level 3 land cover classes but for ease of \ninterpretation and efficiency a different class combination is used. CLC level 1 and 2 classes are combined \ninto 8 new groups, the so called LEAC (Land and Ecosystems Accounting) categories.  \n \nThe purpose of the LEAC (Land and Ecosystems Accounting) categories is to build up a structured system \nfor describing land cover changes that groups CLC classes with similar land use and/or environmental \ncharacteristics together. The agriculture class for example is split into \u2018Arable land and permanent crops\u2019 \nand \u2018Pastures and mosaic farmland\u2019. Forests are also split into two classes: \u2019Standing forests\u2019 and \n\u2018Transitional woodland and shrub\u2019. The latter mainly maps areas that have been recently felled or new \nplantations. By treating them as part of a more general class of forested land, normal forest rotations are \nnot confused with the losses or gains of woodland that come about through deforestation or afforestation \n(EEA report no 11/2006). The structure of the current LEAC groupings and their link to CLC level 3 classes \nis set out in Table 2-1 below. In addition, Figure 2--2 maps CLC level 3 and LEAC 2B nomenclatures for \ncomparison purposes. \n \nTable 2-1 Aggregation used for land cover accounts (LEAC classes). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2--1 CLC level 3 and LEAC level 2B nomenclatures for the same extent \n\f\n \n\n9 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n2.3.2  MAES classes \n\nFollowing the mandate of EU\u2019s Biodiversity Strategy8, the Working Group on Mapping and Assessment of \nEcosystems and their Services (MAES) has been set-up to co-ordinate the mapping and assessment of the \nstate of ecosystems and their services at EU-level. To this purpose, and in order to be able to account for \nchanges in ecosystems, a correspondence in form of a reclassification was created between CLC classes \nand the so-called MAES ecosystem types. Table 2-2 shows this correspondence. \n \nTable 2-2: Correspondence between CLC classes and MAES ecosystem types \n\nNote: In the EEA ecosystem extent accounting approach (2020, forthcoming) the CLC class 3.3.4 is no longer \nallocated to an ecosystem type as it is a transitory state rather than an inherent ecosystem characteristic.  \nSource: MAES et al., 2013. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n(8)  EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/strategy/index_en.htm \n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/strategy/index_en.htm\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 10 \n\n2.1.2 The LCF matrix \n\nWhen it comes to land cover changes between two observation periods, the concept of Land Cover Flows \n(LCFs) has been developed to facilitate transparent accounting. The number of potential unique land cover \nchanges is large (44*43 = 1,892), therefore grouping them into change categories, i.e. flows, is a good \nsolution for transparent assessments. LCFs are defined using a hierarchical structure up to three levels, \ndescribing different processes of land cover or land use changes. Several LCF matrices may be derived, \ndependent on user needs. These matrices are used as Look Up Tables in the accounting infrastructure of \nEEA`s Integrated Data Platform (see Chapter 4). Below is an example of a possible grouping of land cover \nflows at level 1 hierarchy: \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF1 - Urban land management: Internal transformation of urban areas. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF2 - Urban residential expansion: Land uptake by residential buildings altogether with associated \nservices and urban infrastructure (classified in CLC111 and 112) from non-urban land (extension over \nsea may happen). \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF3 - Expansion of economic sites and infrastructures: Land uptake by new economic sites and \ninfrastructures (including sport and leisure facilities) from non-urban land (extension over sea may \nhappen). \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF4 - Agriculture internal conversions: Conversion between farming types. Rotation between \nannual crops is not monitored by CLC. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF5 - Conversion from other land cover to agriculture: Expansion of agriculture land use. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF6 - Increase in forest land cover and other semi-natural areas: Farmland abandonment and \nother conversions from agriculture activity or others in favour of forests or semi-natural land.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF7 - Forest internal land cover changes: Conversions between forest classes or between \ntransitional woodland and shrubs and forest. \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF8 - Water body and wetland creation and management: Creation of dams, reservoirs and \nwetlands, and possible consequences of the management of the water resource on the water \nsurface area.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 LCF9 - Changes of land cover due to natural and multiple causes: Changes in land cover resulting \nfrom natural phenomena with or without any human influence, plus rare or not-applicable changes. \n\nFigure 2--2 and Figure 2--3 present \u201cLCF2: Urban residential expansion\u201d and \u201cLCF61: Expansion of forest \nand shrub on agricultural area\u201d.

Altogether five \nmapping inventories have been implemented in this period. These have produced five status layers \n(CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018) and four CLC-change (CLCC) layers for the corresponding \nperiods (1990-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2018). Europe-wide (i.e. EEA-39) CLC and CLCC data are \navailable as vector and raster products. \n \nDue to the technical characteristics of CLC and CLCC data, evolution of CLC update methodology and \nrefinements in the understanding of thematic content (Kosztra et. al, 2017), the time-series statistics \nderived directly from historical CLC data include several inconsistencies. In order to create a solid basis for \nCLC based time-series analysis a harmonization methodology was elaborated. This has created so-called \n\u2018accounting data layers\u2019, which are the data sets recommended to be used for land or ecosystem \naccounting purposes. The methodology for producing this data series is described in this chapter.  \n\n3.1  Summary of CLC mapping methodology \n\nThe first CLC mapping started in 1986 in Portugal, other countries started the mapping later. The first \nEuropean CLC inventory (named CLC1990) includes CLC status information with various reference years \nbetween 1986 and 1996, depending on timing of the national mapping project. The second European \ninventory (CLC2000) already fixed the reference year at 2000 (\u00b11) year, depending on good quality (cloud \nfree) satellite image availability. Three other inventories followed in 6-year periods (CLC2006, CLC2012 \nand CLC2018). CLC status layers are characterised with 25ha Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) and 100m \nMinimum Mapping Width (MMW) \n \nThe mapping of CLC changes started with the 2nd CLC inventory. Due to different reference status years in \ncase of the CLC1990 inventory, the first CLC-Change (CLCC) layer (named CLCC 1990-2000) shows land \ncover changes for various length of periods from 1985-2000 to 1998-2000, while all following CLCC layers \nrepresent the fixed average length of period of 6 years9.  \n \nCLC change layers are characterized with 5 ha MMU and 100m MMW. Delineated CLC change polygons \nare characterized with 2 x 3 digit change types: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Consumption code: CLC status code at first reference year, understood as the loss of a specific land \ncover class by conversion to any other classes over time. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Formation code: CLC status code at second reference year, understood as the gain of a specific land \ncover class by conversion from any other classes over time. \n\n                                                           \n(9)  Note, at certain locations the reference period may vary in extreme cases from 4 to 8 years due to the \u00b11 year \n\ntolerance for satellite image status. \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 14 \n\nAlthough with 44 classes the possible number of change combinations is numerous (44 x 43 = 1832), many \ncombinations are impossible or at least improbable in practice. CLC changes within EEA-39 include \naltogether 909 occurring CLC change types for the period between 2012-2018. \n \nInitial CLC datasets are provided in vector format by national teams for each update period. The national \nCLC inventories are further integrated into a seamless CLC map of Europe. As a next step, seamless vector \nlayers are converted into 100m resolution raster datasets. Most of the modelling and statistical \napplications are based on the 100m raster version of CLC data. The European vector and raster mosaics \nare distributed via Copernicus Land portal10. \n \nThe traditional way of creating CLC & CLCC layers is Computer Assisted Photo-Interpretation (CAPI). Photointerpretation experts, while performing the visual interpretation and manual delineation, apply a \ncomplex set of interpretation and generalization rules by human abstractions to ensure the production of \nvector CLC & CLCC layers fulfilling the technical and thematic specifications. Besides the original and still \ndominating CAPI methodology, there is an increasing number of countries using advanced (bottom-up) \nsolutions (see section 3.1.2).  \n \nOriginal mapping instructions created for the CLC2000 inventory included the recommendation to create \nCLC 1990-2000 changes as the difference of CLC1990 and CLC2000 status layers. However, due to the scale \ndifference between CLC and CLCC data determined by varying (25ha vs 5ha) MMUs this solution resulted \nin the issue that a significant part of valid CLC changes between 5-25 ha size were missing from the CLCC \ndatabase. As drawbacks of this strategy were clarified only after the CLC2000 mapping started, one part \nof the countries has created CLCC 1990-2000 data by intersection of two status layers, the other part of \nthe countries applied the newly developed \"change mapping first\" approach. The consequence is that \nresulting CLCC 1990-2000 data and statistics are not fully comparable between countries. \n \nBased on a decision made by EEA, from the CLC2006 inventory onward the method to be used for \nderivation of CLC-Change database is producing a change database directly, by means of computer-aided \nvisual image interpretation. \n \nThe key steps of CLC update & CLCC mapping are (B\u00fcttner and Kosztra, 2017): \n\n1. Revision of previous CLC status layer (photo-interpretation) \n\n2. Delineation of CLC changes (photo-interpretation) \n\n3. Creation of \u201enew\u201d CLC status layer:  \n\na) CLCnew = CLCold, revised + CLC changes (GIS operation automated) \n\nb) Generalizaton (eliminating polygons smaller than 25 ha by semi-automatic GIS operations) \n\nThe key advantage of a workflow based on change mapping first is the direct, visually controlled \ndelineation of CLCC features, which ensures a significantly higher reliability of CLCC data than any other \nchange derivation method could provide. \n  \n\n                                                           \n(10)  https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover \n\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover\f\n \n\n15 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n3.1.1  Role of CLC revision \n\nThe revision of the previous CLC status layer is an obligatory step, this is being performed in parallel with \nthe delineation of changes (B\u00fcttner and Kosztra, 2017). Basically three kinds of revision were made in the \nhistory of CLC production: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Systematic correction of specific CLC classes: Class definitions of some CLC classes were refined, in \nthis case a systematic re-interpretation or elimination of these classes were performed within the \ncountry database. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Systematic visual examination of the total area looking for possible mistakes before starting CLC \nchange interpretation. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Ad-hoc revision of the CLC layers, correcting remaining mistakes found during change mapping. \n \nThe great advantage of CLC revision is the additional visual correction step ensuring higher thematic \nquality in all three resulting new layers: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Revised CLC status layer of previous reference date (e.g. revised CLC2012) \n \n\n\uf0b7 New CLC-change layer (e.g. CLCC 2012-2018) \n \n\n\uf0b7 New CLC status layer (e.g. CLC2018) \n \nOn the other hand, since the revision is not harmonized with any of previous CLC or CLCC data, the \nthematic consistency may be lost at several locations between the latest and previous CLC layers. \n \n\n3.1.2  Bottom-up approaches  \n\nStarting with the CLC2006 inventory, some countries have deviated from the traditional CAPI methodology \nby introducing sophisticated, but unique solutions for CLC creation. All of these new methods (referred as \nbottom-up approaches) are strongly influenced by the available high-quality land cover related national \nin-situ data. New CLC status layers are usually created by means of intelligent combination of available GIS \ndata supported occasionally by image classification and / or visual interpretation. Different solutions exist \nfor change mapping, in many cases this is done by the traditional CAPI method based on bottom-up \ncreated CLC-status, or in some cases CLCC data are derived in a (semi-) automatic way. \n \nThe on-going work of the EAGLE CLC+ initiative, as a kind of \u201cessence of national bottom-up methods\u201d, \nproposes a conceptual strategy for a harmonized European land monitoring, including the harmonized \ncollection of land cover, land use and other related spatial data and a robust processing chain and rulesets \nto derive CLC compatible results. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2000 CLC2006 \n\n  \n\nCLC2012 CLC2018 \n\n  \n\nCLC differences 2000 - 2006 CLC differences 2006 - 2012 \n\nFigure 3--1 CLC time-series of the city of K\u00f6ln, Germany. \nThe bottom-up method was introduced with the 2012 inventory.

In order to be able to filter out possible bias caused by CLC methodological changes, it is \nimportant to understand the (country specific) evolution of CLC classes and possible biases within these. \nCLC time-series statistics were created on a country basis, showing evolution of specific CLC classes \nincluding available four reference dates. While the evolution of some CLC classes seems to be as \nexpected, some CLC classes may show critical breaks in the evolution. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEvolution of CLC class 111 in Germany Evolution of CLC class 112 in Germany \n\n  \n\nEvolution of CLC class 242 in Spain Evolution of CLC class 423 in Spain \n\nFigure 3--2 CLC time-series statistics calculated on the basis of original CLC data - 100m resolution \nraster, version 18.5 \n\n \nWhile the evolution of CLC class 112 (Discontinuous urban fabric) shows a logical increasing trend in \nGermany, the sharp loss of class 111 (Continuous urban fabric) area from 2006 to 2012 is more a \nmethodological issue than a real signal. Similarly, the sharp loss of 242 (Complex cultivation patterns) and \n423 (Intertidal flat) class areas from 2000 to 2006 in Spain refers to the lack of harmonization in the time \nseries statistics. \n \nThe explanation in both cases originates in changes of CLC mapping approaches. Spain introduced a \nbottom-up CLC mapping methodology during the 2006 update, while Germany introduced similar changes \nduring the 2012 update. Although CLC data created by both, visual interpretation or bottom-up \napproaches correspond to original CLC specifications and status maps are similar (see Figure 3--2), the \ndelineation of resulting features as well as statistical results may lose comparability. \n \nBesides of major changes in the CLC mapping and update methodology, other possible reasons causing \ninconsistencies in time-series were identified: \n \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 18 \n\n\uf0b7 Evolution of CLC class definitions: Based on verification experiences of past CLC inventories, \nunderstanding of CLC class content as well as instructions for photo-interpretation were refined in \nseveral steps11.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 The CLC update methodology does not consider the full time-series, concentrates only on the \nrevision of past status and to the correct delineation of changes. \n \n\n3.2.1  Methodology for harmonization  \n\nThe solution applied for the harmonization of CLC time-series is applicable for the European CLC mosaics \nfrom 2000 onwards. It is based on the idea to combine CLC status and change information in order to \ncreate a homogenous quality time series of CLC / CLC-change layers for accounting purposes fulfilling the \nrelation: \n \nCLC change = CLC accounting new status \u2013 CLC accounting old status. \n \nAdditional criteria of the realization were: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Add more detail to the latest CLC status layer (CLC2018) from previous CLCC information and use this \n\"adjusted\" layer as a reference \n \n\n\uf0b7 Create previous CLC status layers by \"backdating\" of the reference, realized as subtracting CLCC \nbased information for CLC2018 \n\n \nBased on the above principles, the working steps of the creation of CLC accounting layers is as follows: \n\n1) Include formation information from CLC-change layers into current CLC2018 status by creating \nCLC2018 accounting layer.  \n\na. Overwrite CLC2018 with code_2006 from CLC-change 2000-2006. Intermediate result: \nA1_CLC2018.  \n\nb. Overwrite A1_CLC2018 with code_2012 from CLC-change 2006-2012. Intermediate result: \nA2_CLC2018. \n\nc. Overwrite A2_CLC2018 with code_2018 from CLC-change 2012-2018. Result: CLC2018 \naccounting layer. \n\n2) Create CLC2012 accounting by including consumption information (code 2012 from CLC-change \n2012-2018) into CLC2018 accounting layer. Result: CLC2012 accounting layer. \n\n3)  Create CLC2006 accounting by including consumption information (code 2006 from CLC-change \n2006-2012) into CLC2012 accounting layer. Result: CLC2006 accounting layer. \n\n4) Create CLC2000 accounting by including consumption information (code_2000 from CLC-change \n2000-2006) into CLC2006 accounting layer. Result: CLC2000 accounting layer. \n\n \n  \n\n                                                           \n(11)  The latest CLC technical guidelines as well as present and previous instructions for photo-interpreters are available \n\nat the technical library of Copernicus land portal: https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library \n\nhttps://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library\f\n \n\n19 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2018 status (original) A1_CLC2018 + CLC changes 2000-2006 polygons  \n\n  \nA1_CLC2018 + original CLC2018 polygons A2_CLC2018 + CLC changes 2006-2012 polygons \n\n  \nA2_CLC2018 + original CLC2018 polygons CLC2018 accounting + CLC changes 2012-2018  \n\nFigure 3--3 CLC harmonization process steps 1. a-c shown by example. \n \n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2018 accounting + CLC changes 2012-2018 CLC2012 accounting + CLC2012 original polygons \n\n  \nCLC2012 accounting + CLC changes 2006-2012 CLC2006 accounting + CLC2006 original polygons \n\n  \nCLC2006 accounting + CLC changes 2000-2006 CLC2000 accounting + CLC2000 original polygons \n\nFigure 3--4 CLC harmonization process steps 2-4 shown by example. \n  \n\f\n \n\n21 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n3.2.2  Results: Harmonized CLC statistics \n\nHarmonization leads to an increased comparability in CLC time series statistics as many effects causing \napparent false changes are filtered out (Figure 3--5).

Evolution of CLC class \nareas in country statistics shows significantly higher plausibility. \n\n \n\n3.2.3  Known issues \n\nThere still remain some known conceptual and practical issues, which were introduced with the accounting \nmethodology: \n \n\n\uf0b7 The generalization level of CLC status layers (25 ha MMU) and CLC change layers (5 ha MMU) is \ndifferent, correspondingly these datasets are statistically not fully comparable. \n \n\n\uf0b7 As a consequence of the harmonization methodology, under MMU features (i.e. smaller than 25 ha) \nappear in accounting CLC status layers. This does not mean, that the overall spatial resolution of the \nCLC status layer was increased, high resolution features appear occasionally, bound to location of \nCLC changes.  \n \n\n\uf0b7 The presence of under MMU features in a status layer contradicts the original CLC rules and biases \nstatistical characteristics of resulting CLC data. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Although the \u201cchange mapping first\u201c approach assures a high reliability of CLC-change features, no \ncross-harmonization was ensured between CLC-change inventories. This may lead to contradictions \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers/clc-accounting-layers\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 22 \n\nin CLC evolution processes captured by distinct CLC-change datasets and finally may appear in a form \nof unrealistic features in CLC accounting data. \n \n\n\uf0b7 While the revisions were included to the new CLC layer, the pan-European mosaics of previous \nreference dates were not consequently updated with revised CLC layers in CLC2000 and CLC2006 \ninventories \u2192 inconsistency between \u201enew\u201d and \u201eold\u201d status. Example: National CLC2006 was \ncreated via revision and update of national CLC2000. This leads to harmony between national \nCLC2000 and CLC2006 status, but the revisions in national CLC does not appear in European CLC2000 \nmosaic, leading to local inconsistencies of European mosaic of CLC2000 and CLC2006 layers. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Revisions were not applied to all previous status layers \u2192 inconsistency between \u201eold\u201d and \u201eolder\u201d \nstatus. Example: CLC2018 was created via revision and update of CLC2012, these revision were \nincluded to European CLC2012, but not harmonized with CLC2006 and CLC2000 leading to but local \ninconsistencies with previous (CLC2006, CLC2000) status. \n\n\uf0b7 Revisions were not applied to previous CLC changes \u2192 inconsistency between revised \u201eold\u201d status \nand previous change layer.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2018 CLC2018 accounting \n\nFigure 3--6 CLC2018 and CLC2018 accounting layers near Almhult, Sweden. \nUnder MMU (smaller than 2-5 ha) features appear in accounting CLC status layers. \n\n \nFigure 3--7 demonstrates inconsistencies caused by missing harmonization between revised status and \npast change layers. This is an example of the consequences of non-consequent application of \u201cchange \nmapping first\u201d method. Even if previous mistakes were corrected during latest update and CLC2018 status \nshows the correct situation, unrealistic features appear in CLC2018 status because of the lack of \nharmonization between previous CLC-change inventories. \n \nPart of the known issues present in actual version of accounting layers might be eliminated via performing \nraster generalization on accounting results. Conceptual developments within the EAGLE CLC+ initiative are \nalso targeted on developing a methodology for creating harmonized CLC compatible time-series. \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\n23 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCLC2006 status (revised) CLC2006 accounting \n\n  \nCLC2018 status CLC2018 accounting \n\nFigure 3--7 Example of inconsistencies caused by missing harmonization between revised status \nand past change layers. \nForest fire damage (near Val Daubert, South France) around 2006 was recognised by CLC changes (blue \noutlines), but not handled consequently during the update process. Consequence: Some of the burnt areas \nappear erroneously in the CLC2018 accounting layer. \n\n \n\n3.3  The administrative boundaries layer \n\nLand cover and use trends derived from the combination of the time-series of CLC accounting layers \nprovide information at European scale. A detailed understanding of European land cover dynamics is \nfacilitated with the inclusion of thematic or geographical dimensions, such as the political subdivisions of \ncountries, regions and municipalities. Within the land accounting system, a standard administrative \nboundaries layer which covers the whole EEA-39 continental Europe is key for identifying regional trends \nto support national policy objectives. \n \nThe Administrative boundaries EEA-39 layer is a harmonized dataset that combines boundaries \nrepresented by the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) relative to the EU-28 Member \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 24 \n\nStates (in 2019), with the equivalent administrative units relative to the five non-EU EEA member countries \n(Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey) and the six cooperating countries (Albania, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo12, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia).  \n \nIn addition to the official release of Eurostat GISCO 13 , the administrative boundary layer has been \ncombined with the Economic Exclusive Zone dataset14 to assign a country code on the coastal area of the \nCLC accounting layers not covered by the NUTS. This way a perfect matching between the CLC coverage \nand administrative boundaries was achieved. \n \nThe dataset is produced in raster format (GeoTiff) at the same resolution as the accounting layers (100m) \nand contains the aggregation level by Country (NUTS0 and NUTS0+EEZ), NUTS1, NUTS2, and NUTS3 \nregions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n                                                           \n(12)  under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 \n(13)  https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/83f8aa7a-0e3f-4f31-ad95-f9651626d74a \n(14)  http://www.marineregions.org/ \n\nhttps://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/83f8aa7a-0e3f-4f31-ad95-f9651626d74a\f\n \n\n25 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n4 The Integrated Data Platform accounting infrastructure \n\n \n\u00a9 Eleni Alexiou, NATURE@work EEA. @Valentina Pagnanini, NATURE@work EEA; \u00a9 Valentina Pagnanini, NATURE@work /EEA \n\n \nLand and ecosystem accounts describe how ecosystems and land resources change over time in a \nconsistent and systematic way so that the implications of change can be better understood. They are two \ncomponents of natural capital that are vulnerable to depletion and cannot be re-created over periods \nrelevant to most policies. Change can lead to total elimination of ecosystem types; however, for land it is \nmostly the potentials and functions that are transformed through human action. This is expressed by the \ndifferent uses that particular types of land cover can support. A key concern of land cover and ecosystem \nextent accounts is the need to understand the way in which the stocks of different land covers and \necosystem types are transformed over time. \n \nThe land and ecosystem accounting approach adopted by the EEA follows the one recommended in SEEA \nhandbooks and guidance (see section 1.3). The basis of the SEEA approach is to represent the \ntransformation of land cover over time as a transition matrix, which describes the transfers into and out \nof the different cover categories between two time periods. An equivalent approach is recommended for \necosystem extent accounts. \n \nThe EEA approach for developing land and ecosystem accounts builds on the Integrated Data Platform \n(IDP) infrastructure. The Integrated Data Platform targets integrated geo-spatial data assessments. \nThrough discovering semantic and contextual linkages between datasets, the IDP supports the \nunderstanding of how various elements of our natural capital can be best understood in relationships with \neach other and with other systems. This chapter describes the various building elements of this accounting \ninfrastructure. \n \nProducts of the IDP derived through the tools below are published and maintained on EEA\u00b4s Geospatial \nEnvironmental Accounting website: \n \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/  \n \n\n4.1 The EEA reference grid as common data integrator \n\nThe use of reference grids has been recognised as key point for the integration of heterogeneous sources \nof data. The standard codification of grid cells makes the reference grids suitable for splitting the territory \ninto a number of regular pieces that can be used as analysis units.  \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 26 \n\n \n\nFigure 4--1 LCF6 \u2013 The EEA reference grid as a common data integrator. \n \nThe 1 km2 European Reference Grid (ERG) was adopted by several European stakeholders at the First \nWorkshop on European Reference Grids (JRC-IES-LMU-ESDI, 2003). This layer was adopted as the common \nEEA reference grid and data integrator layer. In this layer the grid cells store the land cover information \n(i.e. the area of land cover classes) and complementary information to be used as reporting units or \nancillary datasets for the assessments. Depending on the nature of the dataset or variable, we distinguish: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Geographic dimensions: define the geographical unit that each cell belongs to (NUTS region, NUTS, \nUMZ, biogeographical unit, etc.) \n \n\n\uf0b7 Thematic dimensions: define a physical characteristic of a grid cell, such as land cover type. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Measures: numeric variables which can be aggregated by any combination of the data dimensions \navailable in the accounting model. They can be biophysical variables (e.g. vegetation productivity), \nclimate (precipitation, temperature) but also socioeconomic figures (e.g. population, unemployment, \nGDP, etc). \n \n\nThe EEA-39 reference grid consists of 5 885 212, 1 km cells (CLC non-NULL), each of which can hold a data \nrecord in the LEAC database. The geographic and reference dimensions are intersected with the 1 km2 EEA \nreference grid, in order to give each grid cell a unique feature code (e.g. a NUTS3 code, a Biogeographical \nregion code, etc.). \n \nConsidering that some thematic layers have a higher resolution than 1 km2 (e.g. Corine Land Cover is \navailable at 100 m2 resolution), the combination of such information is carried out at 100 m2. In this way, \nit is possible to store, for instance, the different land cover classes and their surfaces for each grid cell. This \nmeans it is also feasible in principle to run account calculations at the 100 m2 grid level. The grid cell index \n(unique identifier for each grid cell) might appear repeated in the resulting output table, as many times as \ndifferent land cover classes exist within the square kilometre. Geographic dimensions will have their code \nrepeated as well: \n\f\n \n\n27 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 4-2 Example of unique combination of units within a grid cell \n\n \n\n4.2 The accounting infrastructure \n\nThe EEA IDP project basically addresses 3 working areas: \n\n1) Organise knowledge - spatial data management: This module is working on spatial data \nmanagement. Tasks identify, describe and integrate key spatial datasets into EEA\u2019s Spatial Data \nInfrastructure (SDI).  \n\n\uf0d7 Spatial data QA/QC and harmonization \n\n\uf0d7 Spatial data registration in EEA\u2019s Spatial Data Infrastructure \n\n\uf0d7 Linking SDI metadata to other EEA systems  \n2) Inventory of knowledge - semantic inventory of spatial data sets simplifies the complexity around \n\ngeo-spatial data. The complexity is caused by numerous working areas and analytical expertise. \nThe inventory module of the Integrated Data Platform therefore develops a contextual \nframework, by discovering, organizing and structuring semantic information about our geo-spatial \ndata. This becomes a contextual inventory, summarizing the technical, thematic and contextual \ninformation of EEA\u2019s spatial datasets, which supports the needs of the analytical community. Three \ncontextual inventories are developed: \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive contextual data inventory  \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive data linkages \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive web map platform  \n3) Integrated analysis using organised knowledge: Solutions in this working area directly enable \n\nintegrated assessments by a system infrastructure combining geo-spatial and tabular datasets \n\nfrom a wide range of data sources and properties. Working area are:  \n\n\uf0d7 Data cubes \n\n\uf0d7 Interactive data viewers \n\n\uf0d7 Integrated modelling \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 28 \n\n \nFigure 4--2 The three working areas of the EEA IDP project. \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Spatial data harmonization \n\nAll EEAs accounting datasets must be harmonized and managed correctly so that they have the best \npossible quality. A spatial data delivery workflow was designed with Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality \nControl (QC) criteria for spatial datasets to be harmonized. Although these criteria are meant for spatial \ndatasets, there are other types of information, which are closely related to spatial datasets. Map \ntemplates, draft maps, tabular data and the delivery of graphs related to spatial datasets are therefore \nalso addressed. Compulsory deliveries which must accompany spatial datasets are 1) metadata, 2) web \nmap services, 3) layer (*.lyr) files, draft maps and map templates if intended for publications.  \n \n\n4.2.2 Spatial data registration in EEA\u2019s Spatial Data Infrastructure \n\nWithout a structured inventory any work with data too often requires asking around for relevant datasets \nhoping that someone can point us to the right direction. Once a data set is found one may have to guess \nhow to interpret it, whether it is right for the analysis. Clear and reliable documentation is required to \nknow that the data is accurate, correct and that it does not contain errors. A structured and centralised \nsystem for documenting and searching data sets is needed to ensure that identification and use of data \nsets for assessment purposes can be done in an efficient manner. \n \nAll EEA spatial datasets are registered in EEA`s Spatial Data Infrastructure including a link to the \ncorresponding Discomap web map services15. The data stored in the EEA`s SDI16 are searchable through \nthe SDI catalogue, accessible via: \n \n\n\uf0b7 https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/ \n \nThe website also contains a metadata editor to draft metadata, compliant with EEA metadata profile. The \nSDI wiki, which is also hosted on the website provides user manuals and details on the metadata profile.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(15)  https://discomap.eea.europa.eu/Index/  \n(16)  http://sdi.eea.europa.eu/  \n\nhttps://sdi.eea.europa.eu/\f\n \n\n29 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\nThe datasets, once validated, are physically stored in the SDI file system. Public datasets are available to \nany user without need to log in. Restricted datasets are only accessible with an Eionet log-in (EEA staff, \nEuropean Topic Centres and other Eionet partners). The actual metadata (for public and restricted \ndatasets) are publicly available. \n \nEEA has a thematic node in its SDI on Environmental Analytical Reference Layers (EARL)17, which are \nharmonized and QA/QCd and can be used for environmental accounting.  \n \n\n4.2.3 Interlinking IT systems - Contextual Data Inventory  \n\nOrganised and harmonised storage of spatial datasets and their metadata is indispensable for a data \narchitecture, which is to enable a transparent and repeatable accounting of our natural capital. However, \nthese spatial data specifications are difficult to retrieve for thematic experts because they are not \norganized according to the needs of analytical objectives. In some cases, the information is encrypted in a \ntechnical language that that is not easily understandable for non-IT-experts. For a comprehensive \ninformation system, SDI specifications (e.g. spatial resolution, data format) should be enhanced by \nthematic and contextual information (e.g. DPSIR18 elements, policy objective, topics). These semantics \nneed to be brought together in a Contextual Data Inventory (CDI). Therefore, SDI specifications are linked \nto EEA`s Semantic Data Service (SDS) so that technical information of spatial datasets can be harvested in \na way which targets specific user groups. \n \nThis information is stored in several distinct systems, such as the SDI, the EEA Website CMS (Content \nManagement System), the Semantic Data Service and the server for web map services. These are brought \ntogether in EEA`s Contextual Data Inventory: \n \n\n\uf0b7 Explore the Interactive Contextual Data Inventory on the Geospatial Environmental Accounting \nportal (see under Inventory/Contextual data inventory). \n\n \nPopulating the inventory is generated at regular time intervals (once a day): once the datasets are \nregistered in the SDI and other information are entered in the CMS the information are automatically \nextracted from different systems.  \n \n\n4.2.4 Interactive data linkages  \n\nThe geospatial data inventory is supported by interactive entity relation diagrams in order to increase the \ntransparency and accessibility of the contained information.  \nIn such a visual analytics tool, connections are established on demand, following the users\u2019 interest, in \norder to facilitate the efficient identification of similarities, differences, gaps and complex relationships \nbetween datasets. Much of the interdisciplinary information is hidden in second or third order \nrelationships; visual analytics will facilitate the design of integrated spatial data assessments by unlocking \nknowledge from various domains and actors.  \n \nAlthough these entity relationship diagrams are centred on geo-spatial data, the underlying database links \nspatial datasets across different domains to numerous other entities, such as EEA indicators, projects, \ndeliverables, models, products, publications etc. Therefore, this inventory may also become an effective \nplanning tool and can be used for communication to a non-technical audience and policy makers.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(17)  https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/search?any=idp_*&facet.q= \n\nstatus%2Fnotobsolete&resultType=details&sortBy=relevance  \n(18)  Elements of the DPSIR framework are: Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact and Response. See \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/92-9167-059-6-sum/page002.html  \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 30 \n\n\uf0b7 Explore data linkages on the Geospatial Environmental Accounting portal (see under \nInventory/Linked data). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4--3 Screen shot from the Interactive Contextual Data Inventory \n \n\n4.2.5 Interactive web map viewer \n\nThe Integrated Data Platform also visualizes spatial datasets by producing web map services and visualizing \nthem in web map viewers. Web map services are protocols for serving georeferenced map images, which \na map server generates using data from a GIS database. Web map viewers enable spatial overlays so that \nthe datasets can be interactively explored also by project managers without GIS expertise or without \nimmediate access to a GIS software. Web map services are produced in ArcGIS desktop and visualized in \nArcGIS Online. Once a web map service is quality controlled the services are registered in the SDI and read \nin the IDP Web Map Viewer through the Contextual Data Inventory application. \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\n \n\n31 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 4--4 Screen shot from the Geospatial Environmental Accounting Portal \n\n \n \n\n\uf0b7 Explore the map viewer on the Geospatial Environmental Accounting portal (see under \nInventory/Linked data). \n\n \nThe web application offers three main functions to the user for data exploration:  \n\n1) Search for a web map service: the search uses 1) keywords (i.e. tags such as land use), or 2) topic \nnames (such as biodiversity). The keywords are also searched in the abstract of the related spatial \ndataset, which is harvested from the SDI. Hence, all datasets can be found which have e.g. Corine \nLand Cover in their abstract.  \n\n2) The user is able to visualise and explore the services identified by the search function. \nFurthermore, the selected web map can be overlaid for further exploration of commonalities \nbetween spatial datasets.  \n\n3) Once the wished services are found and explored by overlays and zoom functions, the user can \nfind all relevant semantic information of the spatial datasets when activating the info button. This \nsemantic information are combinations of technical information coming from the SDI and other \nsemantics harvested from the content management system. \n\n4.2.6 Data cubes  \n\nIn the past, the OLAP database (OLAP Cube) was used to organise and query huge volumes of geospatial \ndata. OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing; it is a computer-based technique to answer multidimensional analytical queries. OLAP tools enable users to analyse multidimensional data interactively \nfrom multiple perspectives. It experienced a strong growth in the late 90s, but it had been mainly applied \nto business data in the search for business intelligence.  \n \nThe former OLAP database has been replaced by EEA`s own data cube technique, the Joint Environmental \nData Infrastructure (JEDI). The JEDI system uses cloud infrastructure to integrate diverse data types in near \nreal time. JEDI is component based in order to accommodate flexibility and change, while new user \nrequirements are shaped over time. JEDI prepares tabular data cubes for accounting and serves these data \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 32 \n\ncubes to the Business Intelligence software Tableau. The database is a *.csv file and hence can be opened \nwith other software than the default choice of Tableau. Year to year changes or area statistics of land \nsurface processes can then be calculated and results plotted in a user friendly, attractive and interactive \nway.  \n \nThe system architecture of JEDI is rather complex using various software: Microsoft .NET for IIS (website), \nMicrosoft SQL (DBMS), FME Server and Microsoft Azure (data processing) and Microsoft SQL + Tableau \n(output) (Figure 4--5). JEDI can be accessed at http://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu for users with EEA\u2019s \nCommon Workspace credentials. \n \nJEDI reads spatial datasets into a regular grid (see section 4.2) where every cell has a unique identifier. \nThese cells become the geo-reference identifier for every other spatial dataset integrated in JEDI. Through \nthis common identifier JEDI can relate and calculate areas based on the same cell identifier. After reading \nthe geo-spatial layers, JEDI converts them into a tabular format, i.e. dimension. All, or any user selected \ndimensions, can be then aggregated within user defined spatial units. These aggregated dimensions are \nthen added into one database (a data cube) which can be directly accessed by a data visualisation software \nenvironment, called Tableau. \n \n\n \nFigure 4--5 JEDI system architecture \n\n \n\nJEDI dimensions, look up tables and cubes \n\nThe main elements in JEDI are dimensions, look up tables (LUT) and cubes: \n\n\uf0b7 Dimension: a spatial dataset distributed in a grid and ready to become part of a cube. \n\n\uf0b7 Look up table: table aimed at enriching the attributes of a dimension. \n\n\uf0b7 Cube: multidimensional database built from several dimensions and look up tables and based on a \ngrid. \n\n \nThere are three potential dimension sources: \n\n\uf0b7 ESRI Shapefile (vector) \n\nhttp://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu/\f\n \n\n33 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n\uf0b7 GeoTIFF (raster) \n\n\uf0b7 External dimension file (CSV) \n \nDimensions can be processed at 100x100m or 1x1km grid resolution. Look up tables add additional \ninformation to the dimensions in an efficient way. They can be Excel or .csv files. A LUT can be linked to \none or many dimensions, by any of the dimension fields. \n \nJEDI cubes are created by selecting a set of dimensions and choosing which fields from these dimensions \nor the related LUT should be seen in the output database. The cubes can be created at 100x100m, 1x1km \nor 10x10km grid resolution. \n \nWhen a cube is ready a Tableau *.tds file is created. This extension stands for Tableau data source file. \nThey do not contain any data, but a link to the data source, in this case the SQL database of the cube. \nWhen opened from JEDI, Tableau will show a project connected to the cube, and the different dimensions \nand measures will be available for querying and producing charts and/or maps. \n\nJEDI LEAC Cube \n\nJEDI can calculate and store several cubes, including different sets of dimensions. As for the land \naccounting, a so-called Land and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC) 2018 cube \n(http://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu/Cube/Show/22 ) has been created. That Cube contains the following \ndimensions: \n\n- Administrative boundaries for EEA-39 \n\n- Biogeographical regions 2016 \n\n- Coastal zones \n\n- CLC accounting layers 2000, 2006, 2012, 2018 \n\n- LCFs 0006, 0012, 0018, 0612, 0618, 1218. \n\nThese dimensions can be flexibly complemented with any other thematic or stratification layers thereby \nenriching the accounting information to be deducted from the data cube. This cube is the basis for the \nLEAC viewer, both the basic and advanced versions, and it is used also for the analysis of land take (land \ntake viewer). \n\n  \n\nhttp://jedi.discomap.eea.europa.eu/Cube/Show/22\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 34 \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n35 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n5 Tools for land and ecosystem accounts and assessments \n\n \n\u00a9 Panos Kalimeris, Environment & Me /EEA; \u00a9 Bogl\u00e1rka Gazda, Environment & Me /EEA; \u00a9 Marco Migliozzi, My City /EEA \n\n \nThis chapter describes the accounting tools and web viewers that EEA has developed. These are mainly \nproduced as interactive dashboards, so that interested users can build their own accounts or extract \nstatistics of interest. The growing number of accounting dashboards are also presented on the Geospatial \nEnvironmental Accounting portal, under the section Explore Europe in Numbers. \n \n\n5.1 Land cover and change statistics: interactive accounting dashboards \n\nAn accounting cube may be directly exploited in the Business Intelligence software Tableau, by means of \nthe creation of queries that offer tabular, chart or map results. The different dashboards that one can \ncreate in Tableau can be published on Tableau Server and can be shared as a direct URL or embedded in \nany website. The Land cover and change 2000-2018 interactive dashboard is published on EEA`s website. \nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics \n \n\n \nFigure 5--1 Land cover and change statistics, embedded in EEA\u2019s website \n \n\n5.2 Deriving accounting statistics for land cover stocks \n\nThe \u201cLand cover statistics (km2)\u201d and \u201cLand cover statistics (%)\u201d tabs in the interactive dashboard allow \nthe accounting for land cover stocks in Europe, with a breakdown for countries and with various selection \nchoices. One can select the CLC, LEAC and MAES categories on various hierarchical levels. By changing \nthese settings, the table changes accordingly displaying the chosen statistics.  \n\nhttp://eeadmz1-dis3-wordpress-geo.azurewebsites.net/\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 36 \n\n \nOne might be interested in land cover statistics in certain NUTS3 classes or biogeographical regions, which \ncan be chosen under the \u201cSelect geographical unit\u201d filter. The default geographical unit selection is \ncountries and the table below shows accordingly the land cover stock break-down per country. The column \ntotals of the table sum the country specific break down of the land cover categories and hence display the \nEuropean totals. Selecting EEA-39 or EU-28 allows the user to explore the total area of land cover \ncategories within these geographic areas at once.  \n \nThe \u201cLand cover statistics as charts\u201d tab in the interactive dashboard allows the exploration of land cover \nstock statistics in chart format. This allows the direct comparison of countries in terms of their land cover \ncharacteristics as the chart is ordered in decreasing order of area extent of the various classes. \n \n\n \nFigure 5--2 Interactive queries of land cover stock statistics in tabular formats \n \nWhile selecting CLC or LEAC categories as \u201cLand stock types\u201d will display the absolute extent of land cover \nclasses and hence larger countries will have more land cover, other land stock options allow the relative \ncomparisons. Selecting e.g. \u201cLand Cover Flows 2018\u201d as land stock type allows the direct comparison of \nland use (or natural) changes of the land stock of all countries. As before, the NUTS regions or \nbiogeographical regions may be queried instead of countries and EEA-39 or EU-28 country groups can be \nselected as well.  \n\n5.3  Deriving accounting statistics (consumption and formation) from LCFs. \n\nGeneral statistics on land cover stock or land cover change over time, by different reporting units, are one \nof the main purposes of accounting. Another important element is assessing the different land use \nprocesses that have occurred and analysing which classes have gained or lost area at the expense of other \nclasses, i.e. land cover flows. In other words, what is interesting is analysing not only the quantitative \nfigures of changes, but also the qualitative aspects (from which classes and/or to which classes a specific \ntransition has occurred). The \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 tables\u201d and \u201cAccounting for land cover \nchanges \u2013 charts\u201d tabs of the interactive dashboard provide such kind of assessments to users. \n\f\n \n\n37 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 5--3 Interactive queries of land cover stock statistics in charts \n \nSelecting level 1 Land Cover Flows in EEA-39 in the \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 tables\u201d, displays, \nfor example, that in the period 2000-2018, 24 388km2 of arable land were transformed (Consumption) \nwhereas 17 160km2 of arable land were added to the existing stock. The difference of these values \nindicates that 7 228km2 of arable land was lost. Furthermore, and importantly, the rows of the tables break \ndown these changes to the various land cover flow categories. This way one can analyse the causes for \nlosses and gains of different land cover types. With regards to arable land for example, the statistics \nindicate that major fraction of arable land loss (6 222km2) was due to the sprawl of economic sites and \ninfrastructures.  \n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 38 \n\n \nFigure 5--4 Interactive accounting of land cover stock changes in tables \n \n\n \nFigure 5--5 Interactive accounting of land cover changes in charts \n \nThe \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 charts\u201d tab adds advanced land accounting features to the \ninteractive dashboard. Firstly, in this tab statistics are broken down to the countries, NUTS regions or \nbiogeographic regions in charts and hence direct comparison is facilitated. By selecting the consumption \nor formation \u201caccounting class\u201d the user can explore gains and losses of land covers and by detailing these \naccording to the various land cover flows the (land use) drivers of changes can be analysed. Furthermore, \nby selecting all or a combination of land cover classes all these changes may be analysed in certain \nconditions according to assessment needs. \n  \n\f\n \n\n39 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n5.4  Mapping land stock and land cover changes statistics \n\nThe interactive application for land cover accounting allows the mapping of stocks and changes, \naggregated within NUTS3 and NUTS0 regions for the various periods. By selecting the observation year, \nthe hierarchy of the classification and the land cover of interest, the application will map the query. For \ninstance, in Figure 5--6arable land and permanent crops (level 1 classification hierarchy) for the year 2018 \nare mapped for the EEA-39 region (in % of the total area of the administrative unit). In case land cover \nflow is of interest, the user may select the land cover flows on a given hierarchy (thematic detail) for a \ngiven change period. Figure 5--7 shows the flow 'Increase in forest land and other semi-natural areas\u2019 \n(LCF6) for the period 2000-2018 for the EEA-39 region. The changes are shown in percentage of the NUTS3 \nregions for the purpose of comparability.   \n \n\n \nFigure 5--6 Interactive mapping of land cover stock in NUTS3 regions \n \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 40 \n\n \nFigure 5--7 Interactive mapping of land cover flows in NUTS3 regions \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n41 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n6 Implementing land accounting \n\nThis chapter aims at bringing the rather specific technical and conceptual descriptions of the previous \nchapters into a more practical context. To do so, several use cases are presented that focus on important \nland cover change processes in Europe: \n\n\uf0b7 Urban areas \n\n\uf0b7 Changes in extent and composition of agricultural land  \n\n\uf0b7 Change in forest area and composition \n\n \n\nThe chapters below take a closer look at some of the processes related to the issues mentioned above \nwith statistics, charts and maps derived from the land accounting database. \n\n6.1 Urban areas and land take \n\n \n\u00a9 Marco Migliozzi, My City /EEA; \u00a9 Toni Garc\u00eda, My City /EEA; \u00a9 David Holland, My City /EEA \n\n \nAlmost three quarter of the European population lives in cities (Dijkstra et al., 2016) with a tendency of \nthis share to increase until 2050 (Kompil et al., 2015). At the same time, also artificial surfaces are expected \nto increase (Lavalle and Barbosa, 2015).  \n \nLand take is the process in which urban areas and sealed surfaces occupy agricultural, forest or other seminatural and natural areas (EEA, 2019a). The EEA land take indicator (CSI 014, LSI 001) addresses the change \nin the area of agricultural, forest and other semi-natural land \u201ctaken\u201d for urban and other artificial land \ndevelopment (hence the name \u201cLand take\u201d). Land take includes areas sealed by construction and urban \ninfrastructure, as well as urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities. The main drivers of land take \nare grouped in processes resulting in the extension of: \n \n\n\uf0b7 housing, services and recreation; \n\n\uf0b7 industrial and commercial sites; \n\n\uf0b7 transport networks and infrastructures; \n\n\uf0b7 mines, quarries and waste dumpsites; and  \n\n\uf0b7 construction sites. \n \nIn some cases, artificial land is returned to other land categories (recultivation). The balance between \ntaken and recultivated land is net land take \u2014 the concept behind the EU\u2019s \u2018no net land take\u2019 target. This \nnon-binding commitment of the EU was stipulated in the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe and \nrepeated in the 7th Environmental Action Programme.  \n \n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 42 \n\n \nFigure 6--1 Spatial pattern of net land take in EEA-39 during the period 2000-2018 \n \nRecent data19 shows that annual net land take (see20) in the EEA-39 decreased from 922 km\u00b2/year in the \nperiod 2000-2006 to 440 km\u00b2/year in the period 2012-2018. These values can be deducted from the \ninteractive dashboards on land take accounting statistics accessible at https://www.eea.europa.eu/dataand-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment. Selecting the tab \u201cOverview statistics\u201d and choosing \u201cNet \nland take\u201d as \u201cindicator type\u201d for the EEA-39 extent, the column total for the period 2000-2006 gives \n5530.26 km\u00b2 net land take for the entire area. Broken down to yearly values, annual net land take was \n922 km\u00b2 for the period 2000-2006 (i.e. the total of 5530.26 km divided by 6).  \n \nDuring the entire period 2000-2018, land take concentrated around larger urban agglomerations (Figure \n6--1). Accounting for the land cover types affected by land take during the period 2000-2018 shows, that \n80 % of land take was at the expense of arable land and permanent crops and of pastures and mosaic \nfarmlands. This can be derived from the tab \u201cLand take processes - table\u201d by selecting the period 20002018 and the EEA-39 geographic extent. Total land take was 14049 km\u00b2 of which (i) 7098 km\u00b2 land were \ntaken from arable land and permanent crops (around 50 % of the total) and (ii) 3824 km\u00b2 land from \n\n                                                           \n(19)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics  \n(20)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment  \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/land-take-3/assessment\f\n \n\n43 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\npastures and mosaics (almost 30 %). The top bar and the third bar from the bottom in the chart in Figure \n6--2 also illustrate that land take affected these two land cover types the most (see the tab \u201cLand take \nstatistics \u2013 chart\u201d in the dashboard, \u201cobservation period\u201d 2000-2018, \u201cLEAC code\u201d, Chart type \u201cLand cover \nlost\u201d and \u201cEEA-39\u201d).  \n \nWhile in the beginning of the accounting period (i.e. between 2000 and 2006) the largest drivers of land \ntake were construction activities and diffuse urban sprawl (tab \u201cLand take statistics \u2013 chart\u201d, \u201cobservation \nperiod\u201d 2000-2006, \u201cLEAC code\u201d, Chart type \u201cLand take drivers\u201d and \u201cEEA-39\u201d), this changed towards \n\u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201cindustrial and commercial developments\u201d in the following periods whereas urban \nsprawl did not play such an important role anymore between 2012 and 2018. Over the 18-year period \nfrom 2000 to 2018, industrial and commercial activities accounted for the largest share of land take \nprocesses in EU-28, ca. 3500 km\u00b2 (Figure 6--3). Urban sprawl (around 3000 km\u00b2), the establishment of \nconstruction sites (around 2700 km\u00b2) and mining (ca. 2100 km\u00b2) were further drivers of land take in \nEurope. \n \n\n \nFigure 6--2 Loss of land cover classes due to land take broken down to land take processes. EEA\n39, 2000-2018. \nSource: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics  \n\n \nTaking recultivation measures between 2000 and 2018 into account, four main processes of reusing \nformerly developed land appear: water body creation, creation of semi-natural areas, agricultural \ndevelopment and forest creation (afforestation) (see Figure 6--4), the bars that extend towards the left of \nthe y-axis). Taking recultivation measures between 2000 and 2018 into account, four main processes of \nreusing formerly developed land appear: water body creation, creation of semi-natural areas, agricultural \ndevelopment and forest creation (afforestation) (see Figure 6--4), the bars that extend towards the left of \nthe y-axis).

Opening \nthe tab \u201cAccounting for land cover changes \u2013 charts\u201d, the relevant values can be derived by selecting the \ndesired LCF period (using LCF Level 2), then choosing \u201cFormation\u201d (i.e. gain in accounting terms) and \n\u201cArtificial surfaces\u201d under \u201cAccounting class\u201d. Geographic unit is \u201cCountry\u201d, the extent \u201cEEA-39\u201d. As \ndemonstrated in Figure 6--55 to Figure 6--9, the expansion of construction sites (lcf37) together with the \nsprawl of industrial and commercial sites (lcf31) as well as diffuse urban development (lcf22) have the \nlargest impact in most of the countries. Spain shows the highest levels of artificial area formation in the \nfirst two periods 2000-2006 and 2006-2012, while Turkey climbs the ranking in each of the periods up to \nbe the country with the largest artificial surface formation between 2012 and 2018. In the same period, \nthe formation of artificial surfaces declined substantially in Spain and is only one quarter of what it used \nto be in the previous periods. \n \n\n                                                           \n(21)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics  \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics\f\n \n\n45 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 6--4 Major drivers of net land take processes broken down to land cover classes.

Nevertheless, they allow a very comprehensive tracking of trends in agricultural land area and \nof farming-related land cover trends that show the sources and losses of agricultural land area in great \nspatial detail. \n \nThe overall land area for agricultural production has decreased substantially between 2000 and 2018, \nleading to a reduction of ca 14532 km2 in the EEA-39 in this period, a loss of ca 0.6% of the initial stock of \nfarmland. However, while the consumption of agricultural land (considering both arable land/permanent \ncrops and pastures/mosaics) had its peak in the period 2006-2012, it has declined by around 25% \ncompared to the previous period between 2012 and 2018 (see Figure 6--8).  \n \n\n \nFigure 6--8 Total consumption of agricultural land during 2000-2018, by period, EEA-39 \n \nThe pattern can be explained by deducting statistics from the land accounts viewer (22) by comparing the \nareas that the various LCFs consume under agricultural land use between the period 2000-2006, 20062012 and 2012-201823. Plotting these by countries shows that the main factors behind the decline in the \n\n                                                           \n(22)  https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics \n(23)  See land accounts in https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics#tab\nbased-on-data.

Separating the two categories indicates that it is in particular arable land \nand permanent crops for which the consumption decreased after 2012, whereas the consumption of \npastures/mosaics remained rather stable in all accounting periods (see Figure 6--12). \n \n\n \nFigure 6--9 Decrease of agricultural land during 2000-2018, EEA-39. \n \n \n\n                                                           \ndiffuse residential sprawl\u201d, \u201clcf31 \u2013 Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites\u201d, \u201clcf37 \u2013 Construction\u201d and \u201clcf61\u201d \nand \u201clcf62\u201d.

While in Hungary, \nPoland and Portugal the main factor was converting agricultural land to forests and other semi-natural \nvegetation, in Czechia and Ireland the loss of arable land and permanent crops is to a large extent caused \nby the increase in the area of longer term fallow land and pastures (78 % and 92 %, respectively). However, \nsuch conversion into other types of (potential) agricultural lands are reversible processes and are often \npart of standard rotations of land use on farms. In Spain, the main drivers were construction and sprawl \nof economic sites and infrastructures (24). Turkish arable lands and permanent crops were affected by \nseveral drivers to an almost equal extent: irreversible processes concerned water bodies creation, urban \ndiffuse residential sprawl and sprawl of economic sites and infrastructures. The process of converting \nagricultural land to long term fallow land is however part of standard rotations, as explained above, and \nhence it is a reversible process. Nevertheless, all these processes were responsible for between 10 and \n14 % of loss.  \n \nThe largest gains of arable land and permanent crops were observed in northern Portugal, southern Spain, \nthe Baltic countries (in particular Latvia) and central Finland. While in the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia \nand Lithuania arable land was created by converting pastures, in central Finland the gains were due to \nconverting forests and wetlands into agricultural areas. In Portugal and Spain, the main reasons were the \nconversion of pastures, forest and semi-natural land. \n \nOne reason for the decreasing consumption of arable land and permanent crops is the decreasing \nconversion of agricultural land to forests and other semi-natural vegetation (50 % less area affected \nbetween 2012 and 2018 compared to the previous periods), see Figure 6-12.

Expansion of \nsemi-natural area on agricultural area (lcf62) reaches its highest values in the Netherlands and Spain (20002006 and 2006-2012) as well as Portugal (2012-2018). Over the full period of almost 20 years (between \n2000 and 2018), more forest and shrubland expanded to agricultural area than semi-natural areas (see \nFigures 2-3 and 6-12). Hotspots of converting agricultural land to forests and other semi-natural vegetation \ncould be observed in southern Portugal, Ireland, the Netherlands, and a region from the Baltic countries \ndown to Hungary (see Figures 2-3 and 6-12). \n \n\n \nFigure 6--11 Arable land and permanent crops gains and losses during the period 2000 \u2013 2018, EEA\n39. \n \n \n\f\n \n\n53 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\n \nFigure 6--12 Expansion of forests, shrubs and other semi-natural areas on agricultural land during \n\nthe observation periods 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2012-2018, EEA-39. \n \nIn addition, a distinct change in the structure of agriculture-internal conversions contributed to the modest \nreduction in the overall consumption of arable land (26). While the first two observation periods (20002006 and 2006-2012) saw an almost equal share of conversions from arable land into pastures and vice \nversa, between 2012 and 2018 conversions from arable land into grassland was only half of the \nconversions from grassland into arable land (Figure 6--13).

Afforestation has taken place \nwhen new forests (i.e. broadleaved, coniferous or mixed forest) are planted or seeded on land that was \npreviously not covered by forest. Alternatively, forest re-growth can be observed on land that used to be \nforest in the recent past which has undergone some clear-felling, other management activities, or natural \ndisturbances (storms) so that it was classified as transitional woodland thereafter. Within the land \naccounting concept, both forest and transitional woodland belong to the same category as, in general \nterms, they together represent the forest land use area.  \n \nIn Europe, forest expansion on previous farmland (lcf61, representing a real gain of forested land) declined \nsubstantially between 2012 and 2018, which is one possible explanation for the decline in arable land loss \n(see previous section on agricultural land). On the other hand, this land use change process might be one \nof the reasons for the net concurrent loss of forested land in the period 2012-2018 (see Figure 6--14, \nconsumption of forest surpassed its formation). At the same time, the proportion of internal forest \nconversions, i.e. changes from one forest type into another or changes from forest into transitional \nwoodland and shrub and vice versa (represented by lcf71 \u2013 Conversion of transitional woodland and shrub \nto forest, lcf72 \u2013 Forest conversion to transitional woodlands and shrubs, and lcf73 \u2013 Conversion between \nbroadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest), to total forest formation increased from around 91 % between \n2000 and 2006 to more than 96 % between 2012 and 2018. The total values of those LCFs can again be \ntaken from the tab \u201cAccounting for land cover statistics \u2013 tables\u201d by selecting the respective period, using \n\u201cLevel 2\u201d and extracting the corresponding values of the mentioned LCFs in the column \u201cForest and \ntransitional woodland shrub\u201d for the \u201cFormation of land cover\u201d. The total formation can be read in the last \nrow under the same column. A caveat is the need for discriminating the forest-internal changes within \nlcf74. This information is not directly readable in the land accounts viewer, but has to be derived by \nseparately combining the LCF data with the CLC classes to be able to split lcf74 into changes within the \nLEAC category \u201cForest and transitional woodland\u201d and changes that do not remain within this category. \nOnce those values have been retrieved, the proportion of forest-internal changes to total formation of \nforest can be calculated easily. \n \nThis increase in the proportion of forest-internal changes indicates that most all new forest areas are, with \nincreasing tendency, not new, i.e. previously non-forest, areas, but developing out of transitional \nwoodland. Consequently, when internal conversions are becoming more important, real gains in new \nforest areas, as defined by the land accounting approach (combining forests and transitional woodlands \ninto one category), are decreasing.  \n \n\f\n \n\n55 ETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 \n\nChanges in forest land cover are mainly found in a few European countries (Forest Europe, 2015). Figure \n6--15, covering the period 2000-2018, shows the relation between forest area increase and decrease (27) \nand, hence, highlights regions where forest area increase (in green) or forest area decrease (in red) \ndominate. Local clusters of regions with a dominance of forest area increase can be found in eastern \nEurope from the Baltic countries down to Hungary, else in Ireland and southern Scotland as well as in the \nIberian Peninsula. This distribution of regions with high forest area increase matches well with the \ndistribution of regions that show a significant decrease of farmland area (see Figure 6--11, Converting \narable lands and permanent crops to forests and other semi-natural areas between 2000 and 2018). \nRegions of high forest land cover decrease are clustered in Scandinavia and along the Mediterranean Sea \nfrom Croatia over Italy, southern France, Spain and Portugal.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6--14 Total consumption and formation for forests during the three periods. \n \nOne reason for the (temporary) loss of forest area is forest fires. While they occurred in the past as well, \ntheir frequency and intensity increased in the last couple of years (28). Fires mainly hit southern European \ncountries along the Mediterranean coast and in south-eastern European countries where temperatures \nhave always been generally higher. Over the full 18-year period, Portugal was most impacted by forest and \nshrub fires (Figure 6--15), with the largest damages occurring in the periods 2012-2018 and 2000-2006. In \nSpain, mainly the period 2000-2006 was concerned. Like Portugal, Italy recorded the highest consumption \nthrough fires in the most recent period, whereas Greece and Albania showed high values in the period \n2006-2012 (see period details in Figure 6--16 to Figure 6--19). \n \nA Nordic exception to the listed Mediterranean countries is Sweden, which recorded relatively large losses \nof forest and transitional woodland shrubs through fires between 2012 and 2018. The reason was the \nexceptional wildfires in 2018 caused by unusually hot and dry conditions in spring and early summer (29), \na situation that already continued in early 2019 (30). \n\n                                                           \n(27)  Afforestation is the establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land that, until then, was \n\nnot classified as forest, while natural expansion of forest happens through natural succession on land that, until \nthen, was under another land use (e.g. forest succession on land previously used for agriculture). Deforestation \ndescribes the conversion of forest to other land use or the long-term reduction of the tree canopy cover below the \nminimum 10 percent threshold.

Key EU policy documents, i.e. the Seventh \nEnvironment Action Programme and the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, set as main objectives the \ndevelopment of natural capital accounts in the EU, with a focus on ecosystems and their services, including \nland. Furthermore, work at international and European level drives forward the development and update \nof ecosystem accounting standards and related accounts. For example, the 2019 European strategy for \nenvironmental accounts describes priorities and actions to be developed for the use of environmental \naccounts in a harmonised way. For serving the European policies especially on natural capital and \nbiodiversity, enlarged production of ecosystem accounts, forest accounts, water accounts and land \naccounts have been identified.  \n \nEEA has developed land and ecosystem accounting methods for about two decades. This report describes \nthe state of the art of concepts and methods for geospatial environmental accounting at EEA and ETC/ULS, \nwhich aim to be transparent, repeatable and efficient. They are designed to facilitate the assessment of \nstatus and trends in natural capital and provide efficient input to analysis supporting environmental and \nsectoral policies. The methods presented in this report are flexible and may be used to any categorical \ngeospatial data to account for gains and losses as well as other geo-spatial analysis.  \n \nThe core data set underpinning the EEA land and ecosystem accounting system is Corine land cover but \nmany other data sets are also integrated into EEA\u2019s approach. The CLC accounting layers enable the \nconsistent assessment of land accounts for the almost 20 years period of 2000-2018. The CLC accounting \nlayers may be freely integrated with other datasets, such as biogeographical regions, administrative \nboundaries, geo-physical variables such as elevation classes, other land use information such as landscape \nfragmentation or socio-economic variables such as population density to shed light on drivers and \npressures of land cover and land use change. The EU Copernicus earth observation programme and the \nincreasing collection of geo-spatial data on ecosystems and biodiversity will increase the data sets \navailable for land and ecosystem accounting manifold. This is an aspect already taken into account for \ndeveloping EEA\u2019s future land and ecosystem accounting approach. \n \nEEA\u2019s Integrated Data Platform allows the efficient, transparent, repeatable and hence quality controlled \nintegration of geo-spatial datasets in accounting statistics. By converting geo-spatial datasets into analysisready formats, the workflow is faster and more effective than performing GIS analysis on raw data. In case \nfor example a new version of one of the input geo-spatial datasets becomes available, update of the \naccounting cubes is efficient as only the dimension in question needs to be renewed. Furthermore, as the \ndimensions are stored in the cloud environment, the use of the same inputs are ensured in case of several \nexisting versions of the same input dataset. This allows the system to deal with the increasing set of input \ndata sets as well as of analytical demands efficiently.  \n \nWith the increasing number of high spatial and temporal resolution Earth Observation images, data are \nbecoming bigger and bigger in size, in many cases reaching several hundreds of terabytes. The \nmanagement and processing of big data is therefore a necessity in order to ensure fast, efficient, up-todate and state-of-the-art policy support. This is the way forward in EEA`s future geospatial environmental \naccounting system and will allow a more versatile support to a wider range of policy questions.  \n\n \n\n  \n\f\nETC/ULS Report | 02/2020 62 \n\nReferences \n\nB\u00fcttner, Gy. and Kosztra, B., 2017: CLC2018 Technical Guidelines.

This corresponds to 1.466 % of the total EEA-39 area.\nBetween 2006 and 2015, soil sealing (imperviousness) in all EEA-39 countries increased by a total of 3 859 km2, an annual average increase of 429 km2. During this period, the average annual increase in soil sealing relative to country area varied from 0 % to 0.088 %.\nIn 2015, the percentage of a countries' total area that was sealed also varied greatly, with values ranging from 16.17 % (Malta) to 0.07 % (Iceland). The highest sealing values, as a percentage of country area, occurred in small countries with high population densities, while the lowest sealing values can be found in large countries with low population densities.\nThe average annual increase in sealing was 460 km2 between 2006-2009, increasing to 492 km2 for the 2009-2012 period and slowing to 334 km2 for the 2012-2015 period. The slow-down in the sealing increase between the two reference periods occurred in 31 out of 39 countries. The same trend is visible for sealing figures normalised by the size of the country (the % of the country newly sealed on average annually for the three periods).\nThe most problematic situation occurs in countries where there is already a high percentage of sealing and where the annual rate of increase relative to country area is high. Even more problematic are situations where, for 2012-2015, the rate of sealing increase is accelerating, in contrast to the general trend of a slowing rate of increase.\nFig. 3: Imperviousness density in 2015\nNote: The map shows the density of soil sealing in 2012, based on a 10 km2 reference grid. Green and light orange colors show areas with no or very limited sealing, while red and dark red colors show highly to fully sealed grid cells (mainly urban areas).\nData source:\nFig. 6: Average annual change in soil sealing, 2006-2015\nNote: The map shows the percentage of the average annual change in soil sealing for each of the rectangular 10 km x 10 km grid cells, over the 2006-2015 period\nData source:\nBoth absolute levels of soil sealing (in km2) and relative sealing levels (in % sealed of the country) vary greatly from country to country. Relevant factors affecting the extent of sealing are (among many others):\nIn general, it is important to keep in mind that real sealing levels in most countries are above those captured in the imperviousness products. The imperviousness change and status products reliably capture the spatial pattern and magnitude of sealing, and the general trends in sealing change, but due to the pixel-size of the satellite imagery used (20 m), very small-scale sealed surfaces are sometimes not captured. In addition, the product deliberately does not 'burn in' any additional datasets (e.g. road network data), because it would reflect directly any errors and inconsistencies in update frequency and quality of the additional input data. This needs to be considered if the sealed area from the imperviousness data is compared to sealing statistics available in some countries, which are based on very precise and constantly updated cadastral data. For the 2018 update of the imperviousness data, the status layers will dramatically improve in spatial resolution from 20m (currently) to 10m pixel size. This is expected to increase the level of small-scale sealing that can be detected. The change products for the upcoming 2015-2018 products will separate 'changes' due to technical improvement (so called 'technical changes') from real changes in sealing, and will be available at 20 m spatial resolution.\nBelow, four dimensions of sealing and sealing change are explored to provide a comprehensive picture of the status and trends:\nTo explore the Imperviousness data time-series in more detail (going beyond the maps and graphs provided here), please go to the Imperiousness interactive data viewer\nIn 2015, 85 861 km2 were mapped and categorised as sealed surface in the Copernicus imperviousness product. This corresponds to 1.466 % of the total EEA-39 area.\nBetween 2006 and 2015, soil sealing (imperviousness) increased in all EEA-39 countries by a total of 3 859 km2, corresponding to an annual average increase of 429 km2. The countries with largest sealed area in absolute terms in 2015 were Germany, with 15 419 km2, followed by France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania and Portugal. These 10 countries make up 76 % of the total sealed area in the EEA-39 (while comprising only 58 % of the total area).\nWhile in all countries the sealed area continues to increase for all 3-year periods (2006-2009, 2009-2012 and 2012-2015), for most countries the rate of average annual increase is highest in the period 2009-2012, slowing down for the period 2012-2015. The average annual increase was:\nThe increases and their change over the three time periods (km2) are illustrated in detail in figure 2. The trends in four broad categories are summarised below, however, the absolute and relative sealing values differ quite a lot and need to be considered further. For example while sealing increase shows an accelerating trend and high absolute values for Turkey, the percentage of the country sealed is still very low compared to most EEA-39 countries):\nWhile on average, 1.414 % of the total (valid[1]) area covered by the countries was sealed in 2006, this increased to 1.481 % in 2015. See Figure 1 for a comparison of country averages between 2006 and 2015, and Figure 3 for a map of sealing density in 2015, based on a 10 km grid.\nThree groups of countries could be identified:\na) Countries with a very low sealed area as a percentage of total (valid) area (i.e. <1.0 %), e.g. Iceland (0.067 %), Norway (0.236 %), Latvia (0.382 %), Sweden (0.384 %) and 11 other countries.\nb) Countries with medium-high sealing percentages (relative to the valid country area) between 1.0 % and 3.0 %. There are 17 such countries.\nc) A considerable number of countries with high sealing values between 3.0 % and 16.15 %. There are seven such countries, including Germany (4.264 %), Liechtenstein (4.505 %), Belgium (6.039 %), the Netherlands (7.354 %) and Malta (16.152 %).\nSee Figure 1 for the full list of countries and their % sealing in all four reference years (2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015).\nA more detailed spatial pattern of existing sealing in 2015, based on 10 km grid cells, can be seen in Figure 3. The main urban areas that have grid cells with high sealing levels are shown in dark red, while green areas represent grid cells without any sealing detected in the 2015 imperviousness product.\nGiven that the imperviousness indicator does not capture land cover flows, it is not possible to monitor directly which land cover is mainly affected by an increase in sealing. The indicator can, however, be used together with Corine Land Cover (CLC) to establish in more detail which land cover strata are mainly affected by sealing increases.\nOn average, most of the sealing increases between 2006 and 2015 occurred in the Corine Land Cover classes listed below. Most of the changes occurred in just a few of the classes.\nCorine Land Cover classes with the highest percentage of sealing:\nThe percentage of Corine Land Cover classes (for 2018) covered with impervious surfaces (for the 2015 reference year) ranges from close to 0 % for many of the natural classes (peat bogs, moors and heathland etc.) to 63 % for Class no. 111 (Continuous urban fabric). The classes with the highest percentage of sealing are:\nCorine Land Cover classes with the largest average annual increase in imperviousness (in km2)\nThe largest yearly increase in sealing, for the 2012-2015 period happened in the Corine Land Cover class 112 (Discontinuous urban fabric), but also in some agricultural classes (211, Non-irrigated arable land, and 242, Complex cultivation patterns). This confirms that imperviousness is increased in part by consuming agricultural land. The five classes with the largest annual increases are:\nSealing increased in all countries between 2006 and 2015. The average percentage annual increase for the period was 1.569 % across the EEA-39, with annual values ranging from 0.264 % for Malta, to 6.212 % for Iceland. See Figure 4 for yearly increases by country. However, it should be noted that in countries with little relative and absolute sealing (e.g. Norway), even relatively modest (absolute) increases create high rates of change.\nPercentage of average annual increase in sealing area (2006-2015) relative to (valid) country area (imperviousness indicator)\nThe imperviousness indicator shows that, on average, the annual rate of increase amounted to 0.008 % of the total (valid) EEA-39 area for the 2006-2015 period. This means that on average, for that period, 0.008 % of the EEA-39 area was newly sealed every year. The overall trend for the whole EEA-39 showed an increase from an annual average increase of 0.009 % (2006-2009), to 0.011 % (2009-2012), followed by a decrease to 0.006 % for the latest period (2012-2015), similar to the trend in absolute figures. See Figure 5 for a graph with results by country, separate for all three periods, and Figure 6 for a map with the percentage annual increase in sealing area (for the whole period 2006-2015) relative to the 10 km grid cells used for the mapping.\nThe countries with the highest values for the latest period (2012-2015) are Cyprus, Kosovo, Poland,Turkey, Belgium and Germany, while the highest values for the period 2009-2012 were in the Netherlands, Malta, Luxembourg, Belgium, Cyprus and Switzerland.\nIn terms of the direction of trend there are again four main groups of countries, largely the same as those reported in the section on the changes in absolute sealing increase trends (but not exactly the same, as the figures here are normalised for country area).\n[1] When reporting relative sealing, we usually refer to the 'valid area' of the country. This refers to all pixels in that country that had valid sealing data in all four reference years (i.e. that did not have 'no data' at any time). Given that there are always changing areas of 'no data', e.g. due to clouds in all reference years, this allows the sealing trends to be mapped consistently and ensures comparability of the figures. The difference from the total area is small, with the valid area covering on average 99.01 % of the country area.\nThe imperviousness indicator is defined as the yearly average imperviousness change between two reference years, as measured by imperviousness change products. The change is aggregated for a certain reference unit and expressed relative to the size of that unit (as a percentage). The imperviousness change value for a 100 m raster cell is based on 100 m imperviousness change products. The default reference unit is the country, but the indicator can be aggregated based on different spatial units. For example, for a certain country, an imperviousness indicator value of 0.2 %, means that on average, an additional 0.2 % of this country's area has been sealed annually during the period between the two reference years in question. If above a certain rate of increase (threshold values), this value can be used as a warning sign. The aggregation of imperviousness values to reference units is performed using the integrated spatial data platform at EEA.\nThe unit used for this indicator is the yearly average percentage change in imperviousness relative to the size of the reference unit. It is important to note that the yearly average value is based specifically on the period reported, e.g. 2006-2009, 2009-2012 or 2012-2015, or for the whole time period for which data are available (2006-2015).\nThe main policy objective of this indicator is to measure the extent and dynamics (change) of soil sealing, resulting from the development of urban and other artificial land uses.\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio in 2012 (Rio+20), world leaders identified land and soil degradation as a global problem and committed to 'strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world in the context of sustainable development'. At the EU level, the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes a strong focus on the unsustainable use of land and soil, including explicitly the issue of soil sealing. In this context, the 7th EAP refers to a Commission Staff Working Document with the title 'Guidelines on best practice to limit, mitigate or compensate soil sealing' (SWD/2012/0101).\nIn addition, land take is explicitly mentioned in chapter 23 of the 7th EAP, stating that:\nEvery year more than 1 000 km\u00b2 of land are taken for housing, industry, transport or recreational purposes. Such long-term changes are difficult or costly to reverse, and nearly always involve trade-offs between various social, economic and environmental needs. Environmental considerations including water protection and biodiversity conservation should be integrated into planning decisions relating to land use so that they are made more sustainable, with a view to making progress towards the objective of 'no net land take', by 2050.'\nIn recognition of the importance of land in safeguarding natural resources, the Commission is considering a Communication on 'land as a resource'.\nOther important references can be found in A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development (COM(2001)264) and the thematic documents related to it, such as the Commission Communication Towards a Thematic Strategy on the Urban Environment (COM(2004)60), Cohesion Policy and Cities: the urban contribution to growth and jobs in the regions (COM(2006)385), Europe 2020 (COM(2010)2020), general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, as well as the concept of territorial cohesion.\nAlthough there are no quantitative targets for soil sealing/imperviousness at European level, different documents reflect the need for better planning to control urban growth and the extension of infrastructures. Policies relating explicitly to land use issues, and especially physical and spatial planning, have, until now, generally been the responsibility of the authorities in Member States. The European Commission's Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 571) introduces, for the first time, a 'no net land take by 2050' initiative that would imply that all new urbanisation will either occur on brownfields or that any new land take will need to be compensated by reclaiming artificial land.\nEuropean policy, although it has no spatial planning responsibility, sets the framing conditions for planning. At the European level, the 1999 European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP), a non-binding framework that aims to coordinate various European regional policy impacts, already advocates the development of a sustainable, polycentric and balanced urban system with compact cities and a strengthening of the partnerships between urban and rural areas, as well as parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge, and wise management of natural areas and cultural heritage. The 2008 Green Paper on territorial cohesion, and the 2007 EU Territorial Agenda and Action Plan by the Territorial Agenda of the EU and the Action programme for its implementation (COPTA, 2007) build further on the ESDP. Specific, relevant actions in the field of 'Land', in particular are Action 2.1d 'Urban sprawl' and Action 2.2 'Territorial impact of EU policies'.\nDemand for new urban areas may be partly satisfied by brownfield remediation. Its environmental advantages are clear: relieving pressure on rural areas and greenfield sites, reducing pollution costs, more efficient energy use and natural resource consumption, facilitating economic diversification and emerging habitat (housing) requirements. Europe has several examples of regional strategies for economic regeneration and brownfield development (The OECD Territorial Outlook 2001). On average, land recycling increased steadily between 1990 and 2012 on an annual basis, with considerable variation between countries, and within countries. Stronger links between EU urban and soil policies could encourage this further (e.g. following up respective 6th EAP Thematic strategies).\nEuropean Commission, 2010.

The data loaded in an accounting matrix show land cover gains and\nlosses over time and can inform policy action on the main land use processes.\n\nThe European Environment Agency has developed land and ecosystem accounts that are\naligned with the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting, as well as\nan Integrated Data Platform, which together facilitate the consistent, systematic and rapid\ncalculation of accounts.\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting 1\n\f\nPolicy relevance of land accounting\n\nLand is a resource that supports important production functions and ecosystem services, such as the\nprovision of food and fibre, the maintenance of nutrient cycling, terrestrial biodiversity, water\nregulation and purification, and climate change mitigation (EEA, 2019a). The integration of land\ncover, land use and land use change data with other thematic areas is required to address the\nclimate and environmental sustainability priorities of the European Green Deal and other EU policies.\n\nAt a global level, land degradation neutrality is included in target 15.3 of the United Nations (UN)\nSustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs) and land use information underpins several other\ntargets, e.g. SDG target 11.3 on sustainable cities and SDG target 15.1 on conservation, restoration\nand sustainable use of ecosystems. Moreover, SDG target 15.9 addresses the integration of\necosystem and biodiversity values into accounting, among other things. More recently, the  European\nStrategy for Environmental Accounts 2019-2023 describes priorities and actions for the use of\nenvironmental accounts in a harmonised way.\n\nThe EEA\ufffds approach to environmental accounting uses geospatial data and respects the international\nstandards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy, as set out in the UN\nSystem of Environmental Economic Accounting \ufffd Central Framework. A separate briefing describes\nEEA\ufffds approach to developing ecosystem extent and condition accounts (EEA, 2020).\n\nData and methods for land accounts\n\nAccounting is an economic term referring to the systematic process of communicating financial gains\nand losses (i.e. credit and debit). Land accounting therefore requires uniform and harmonised data\non gains and losses in different land categories across the territorial extent in question. Such data\ncome from the monitoring of land cover as seen from Earth observation instruments, such as\nsatellites. Replacing economic assets in the accounts by land cover stocks means the shares of\ndifferent land cover within spatial reporting units, and changes within them, can be quantified. Land\ncover changes can therefore be associated with socio-economic land use processes, and analysis of\nthese changes enables us to evaluate pressures from land use change on the environment.\n\nThe EEA\ufffds land accounting is based on the Copernicus CORINE Land Cover (CLC) datasets for the\nyears 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. CLC status layers for a given reference year (e.g. 2018) use\nmapping units of 25 hectares (ha), but CLC change datasets (e.g. from 2012 to 2018) capture\nchanges at 5 ha. Therefore, simply subtracting one data set from another does not produce the CLC\nchange dataset. In order to solve this, land cover accounting layers are created to produce a\nharmonised time series for the whole period 2000-2018 (ETC/ULS 2020).\n\nThe CLC data set has 44 classes and the number of potential unique land cover changes between\ntwo observation periods is large (i.e. 44*43 = 1 892). Grouping them into change categories known\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting2\n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588580774040&uri=CELEX:52019DC0640\f\nas Land Cover Flows (LCFs) provides transparent assessments, since the flow statistics between\nindividual CLC classes or groupings give important insights into the nature of land cover change\nprocesses. LCFs are defined using three hierarchies that describe different land cover or land use\nchange processes. Of these, level 1 is the most aggregated, containing nine LCF types (EEA, 2006).\n\nThe EEA\ufffds Integrated Data Platform (ETC/ULS, 2020) is made up of geospatial data architecture and\nIT system infrastructure to enable the consistent and systematic production of land and ecosystem\naccounts. In detail, the Spatial Data Infrastructure organises and catalogues geospatial data with an\ninteractive interface. The thematic node Environmental Accounting Reference Layers (EARL)\nassembles harmonised and quality assured datasets. Interactive dashboards enable the exploration\nof geospatial datasets that describe our natural capital.\n\nThe IT infrastructure of the IDP contains the Joint Environmental Data Infrastructure (JEDI, ETC/ULS,\n2020), which uses cloud infrastructure to transfer geospatial data into tabular formats (dimensions).\nUsing data cubes, the dimensions of land cover datasets may be integrated with other dimensions,\nsuch as administrative boundaries, biogeographical regions or bio-physical and socio-economic data.\nFor the integration, uniform reference grids are used with 1 km x 1 km and 100 m x 100 m cells as\nthe accounting units, following INSPIRE directive specifications.\n\nA data cube allows for user driven queries and gives tabular, chart or map results. The EEA\ufffds own\ninteractive dashboard for land accounts (EEA 2019c) displays the land stock and changes to it,\ndetailing statistics by year and by geographical unit (Box 1). Moreover, the data cube allows for the\nefficient combination of various categories of a dimension (e.g. arable lands and permanent crops) or\ncombinations of dimensions aggregated in grids or administrative boundaries.\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting 3\n\nhttps://sdi.eea.europa.eu/\f\nBox 1. Land cover change interactive dashboard\n\nThe EEA\ufffds land cover change interactive dashboard enables land cover\nstocks accounting in Europe. It can be broken down by country and\nincludes various selection choices: year of observation, classification\nhierarchy and breakdown by administrative or biogeographical region. By\nchanging settings, the tables and charts change accordingly to display the\nchosen statistics. The \ufffdAccounting for land cover changes\ufffd tab of the\ninteractive dashboard provides assessments for the drivers of land cover\nchange. Selecting LCF level 1 for the EEA-39 countries, for example,\nshows that in the period 2000-2018, 24 388 km  of arable lands were\ntransformed to some other land cover (i.e. Consumption), whereas 17 160\nkm  of arable lands were added to the existing arable land stock\n(Formation). The difference in these values indicates that arable land\ndecreased by 7 228 km . The rows of the table break these changes down\nto the various LCF categories. This allows us to analyse the causes of\nlosses and gains in arable land cover. For instance, the largest share of\narable land consumption (6 222km2) happened because of growth in\neconomic sites and infrastructure.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting4\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics\f\nAccounting for major land use processes: example on land\ntake and sealing\n\nFigure 1.

The major factors behind land take in the EEA-39 region are\nindustrial and commercial activities, and residential sprawl (EEA, 2019a)  concentrated around larger\nurban agglomerations (Figure 1). In the EEA-39 in the period 2000-2018, 14 049 km  was urbanised\nas indicated by the land take interactive dashboard, mostly at the expense of arable lands and\npermanent crops (around 50 % of the total urbanisation), and of pastures and mosaic farmlands\n(almost 30 %). Soil sealing \ufffd an extreme form of land take \ufffd covers lands with impermeable\nsurfaces, resulting in a decline in land functions. Both land take and soil sealing have slowed down,\nalthough sealing less so: 1.7 % more of the land area was sealed in the period 2012-2015 (compared\nwith an increase of 2.4 % in sealing between 2006 and 2009 in the EEA-39 region (see the soil\nsealing dashboard).\n\nLand recycling \ufffd the reuse of abandoned, vacant or underused land for redevelopment (EEA, 2018)\n\ufffd is still low in all European countries: on average, land recycling accounted for only 13.5 % of total\nland consumption in European cities in the period 2006-2012 (see land recycling dashboard). The\nlargest component of land recycling is densification , i.e. when new urban development makes\nmaximum use of urban space and existing infrastructure.\n\n2\n\n[1]\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting6\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-take-statistics\f\nAccounting for major land use types: example on agriculture\nand forestry\n\nFigure 2.

This is 0.5% decrease in\nthe entire EEA-39 region with localised pattern (Figure 2): largest decreases in the range of 10-15\nha/km2 were seen in Czechia, Hungary, the central part of Spain, southern Portugal, as well as in\nIreland and Estonia. The largest increases in the 5-15 ha/km  range were observed in eastern\nPortugal, the south-western part of Spain and in central Finland. Figure 3 describes the share of\nvarious specific land cover changes contributing to losses of arable land and permanent crops. While\nin Hungary and Portugal the main driver was an increase in the forest and woodland area, in many\nother countries the main driver was the growth in economic sites and infrastructure.  \n\n2\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting8\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/land-cover-and-change-statistics\f\nFigure 3.

During the accounting period 2000-2018, the\nforest area in the EEA-39 region grew by only 0.003 %, or 70 km  (land accounts) Forest land cover\nchange presented a regional pattern during the period 2000-2018, although this is a rather short\nperiod in terms of the full forest management cycle. There are clusters in eastern Europe, Ireland\nand southern Scotland, as well as in the Iberian Peninsula (Figure 4) where the extent of forest land\ncover is increasing. A decrease in forest land cover was observed in Finland and in the\nMediterranean, for example in Greece, Croatia, Italy, Spain and Portugal (up to 15 ha/km ). Figure 5\npresents the main factors behind local decreases in forest land cover. In Portugal and Spain, the\ndominant drivers of this decrease are forest fires and the conversion of forested areas to agricultural\nland. In Turkey, on the other hand, the spread of built up areas, such as economic sites and\ninfrastructure, have driven local decreases in forest land cover.\n\n2\n\n2\n\nLand use\n\nLand use > Land cover accounts \ufffd an approach to geospatial environmental accounting 9\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/drivers-of-arable-land-and#tab-chart_1\f\nFigure 4.

This will be facilitated by the Integrated Data\nPlatform for the integration of diverse geospatial datasets. The methods are\nflexible and may be applied to any categorical geospatial data, while\nstatistics can be broken down to any reference region, e.g. administrative\nNUTS units, river basins, floodplains (floodplains dashboard) or Natura\n2000 areas (Natura2000 dashboard).\n\nWith the increasing number of Earth Observation products and their higher\nspatial and temporal resolution, improved capacity for big data processing\nis becoming a must.

Vegetation productivity is a key indicator of ecosystem condition and can be used to monitor the effects of climate, land use and land use change. From 2000 to 2016, productivity in Europe showed a regional pattern of increase and decline, driven in part by climatic variation, but most notably by land use change. Agricultural land management and converting land for agriculture drove productivity increases, whereas urban sprawl caused declines.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Land use||% change|\n|lcf43 Internal conversions between permanent crops||80|\n|lcf72 Forest creation, afforestation||55|\n|lcf73 Forests internal conversions||55|\n|lcf53 Conversion from wetlands to agriculture||54|\n|lcf54 Conversion from developed areas to agriculture||53|\n|lcf42 Internal conversions between annual crops||50|\n|lcf52 Conversion from semi-natural land to agriculture||50|\n|lcf45 Conversion from arable land to permanent crops||41|\n|lcf44 Conversion from permanent crops to arable land||36|\n|lcf38 Sprawl of sport and leisure facilities||35|\n|lcf61 Withdrawal of farming with woodland creation||32|\n|lcf51 Conversion from forest to agriculture||31|\n|lcf74 Recent fellings, new plantation and other transition||30|\n|lcf71 Conversion from transitional woodland to forest||23|\n|lcf41 Extension of set aside fallow land and pasture||8|\n|lcf46 Conversion from pasture to arable and permanent crops||7|\n|lcf13 Development of green urban areas||2|\n|lcf62 Withdrawal of farming without significant woodland creation||-1|\n|lcf12 Recycling of developed urban land||-13|\n|lcf36 Sprawl of dumpsites||-17|\n|lcf22 Urban diffuse residential sprawl||-21|\n|lcf34 Sprawl of airports||-25|\n|lcf37 Construction||-25|\n|lcf32 Sprawl of transport networks||-26|\n|lcf11 Urban development/ infilling||-27|\n|lcf35 Sprawl of mines and quarrying areas||-28|\n|lcf31 Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites||-33|\nIntensive land use and land use change as a result of human activities cause ecosystem degradation, with loss of vegetation cover and biomass productivity. This is a major threat to the provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity and resilience to climate change and natural disasters, as recognised by the EU\u2019s Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP). The 7th EAP also recognises that, to inform approaches aimed at restoring and maintaining ecosystems, monitoring ecosystem condition is essential. Vegetation productivity indicates both the spatial distribution and the condition of vegetation cover and can therefore be used to assess the condition of ecosystems.\nBetween 2000 and 2016, vegetation productivity changed significantly across Europe. Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites was the most significant cause of declining vegetation productivity in Europe between 2000 and 2016, causing a 33% decline over 3,500 km2. The sprawl of mines and quarrying areas (over 2,100 km2) and of transport networks (covering 1,300 km2) caused a productivity decline of between 25% and 30% over the 17 years. All these processes, including construction sites and urban diffuse residential sprawl, destroy vegetated surfaces and, in the worst case, replace them with sealed areas, causing land degradation, increasing flood impacts and urban heat island effects and contributing to less carbon sequestration. Recycling of developed urban land also caused a decline in vegetation productivity (13%), although these processes reuse already developed lands and hence are better choices in terms of sustainable urban land management.\nForest creation and afforestation resulted in a 55% productivity increase, which had a positive impact on biodiversity and carbon sequestration. This land use change, however, only affected 3,600 km2, or fewer than 212 km2 a year in the entire territory of the EU-27 and the United Kingdom. Conversion from developed areas to agriculture \u2014 a land recultivation process that decreases land takeand increases land use efficiency \u2014 created 50% more vegetation productivity but only over a total of 570 km2.\nConverting semi natural lands to agriculture increased land productivity by 50%. However, this process destroys habitats and can be considered land degradation. Crop rotation increased productivity in the same way and over a comparable area (ca. 13,00 km2). This is mostly due to the intensive management of agricultural fields, which, in the long term, leads to land degradation due to the depletion of soil resources.\n|Country||lcf22 Urban diffuse residential sprawl||lcf31 Sprawl of industrial and commercial sites||lcf37 Construction||lcf411 Uniform extension of set aside fallow land and pasture||lcf421 Conversion from arable land to permanent irrigation perimeters||lcf451 Conversion from arable land to vineyards and orchards||lcf452 Conversion from arable land to olive groves||lcf462 Intensive conversion from pasture to non-irrigated arable land and permanent crops||lcf521 Intensive conversion from semi-natural land to agriculture||lcf61 Withdrawal of farming with woodland creation||lcf71 Conversion from transitional woodland to forest||lcf72 Forest creation, afforestation||lcf73 Forests internal conversions||lcf74 Recent fellings, new plantation and other transition|\n|Austria||48.8|\n|Bulgaria||52.6|\n|Croatia||23.2|\n|Czechia||40.5||14.1||42.7|\n|Estonia||7||27.2||29.6|\n|Finland||25.4||26.9|\n|France||-24.8||-36.8||9.5||7.6|\n|Germany||-23.6||51.3|\n|Greece||54.9|\n|Hungary||66.9||35.1||33|\n|Ireland||-13.4||-26||-18.8||-1.8|\n|Italy||23.3||20.6|\n|Latvia||-2.4||34.3|\n|Lithuania||26.8|\n|Poland||32.3||24.4||33|\n|Portugal||30.7||41.2||48.9||74.7||32.9|\n|Romania||57.3|\n|Slovakia||62.3|\n|Spain||-47.4||-43.2||79.5||53.5||28.3||74.3||22.5||47.5||7.7|\n|Sweden||31.5||72.2||35.4|\n|United Kingdom||14.7||14.5|\nSee the second tab of the dashboard: between 2000 and 2016, industrial, commercial and construction site sprawl caused the greatest productivity decline in Spain, followed by the Netherlands and France (47%), whereas urban residential sprawl impacted productivity the most in Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK (approximately 25%).\nAgricultural management and the conversion of land for agriculture increased productivity overall. The only exception was the conversion of pastures to non-irrigated arable land. This reduced productivity in France, Ireland and Germany (around 25% decline) \u2014 probably indicating the impact of drought on non-irrigated crops \u2014 although it increased productivity in Bulgaria and Romania. Converting pastures to arable lands and permanent crops resulted in a 96% productivity increase in Spain and converting forests to agriculture increased productivity in Portugal by 70% and in Spain by 18%. Converting arable lands to irrigation had a strong effect on productivity increase in Spain (80% increase) and Portugal (50%). These countries also led the conversion of semi-natural lands to agriculture, where productivity increased the most. Forest creation and afforestation had the highest impact on productivity in Portugal, followed by Germany and Poland (72% increase).", "Coverage & representativity\nEuropean protected areas increased in the last decades, covering over 1.84 million km\u00b2 of land and sea. With an area of just over 1 million km\u00b2, the central driver behind this achievement is the Natura 2000 network. On national level, countries exhibit quite distinct approaches in protected area designations and priority setting.\nOverview | Introduction | Coverage & representativity | Size | Connectivity | Protected Species & Habitats | Management | Future\nKey messages\n> Europe's protected areas cover 22.7 % of the terrestrial surface and 8.25 % of the marine realm, for the EU this figure is 25.7% of the terrestrial surface and 11.1 % of the marine realm.\n> For the last two decades, the EU Nature Directives and Natura 2000 were the main driver of protected area action in Europe.\n> The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 requires Member States to further increase the protected area coverage (to 30 %), especially with regards to offshore marine areas and areas with strict protection regimes.\nCoverage\nSince the early 1900s, there has been a continued increase in the coverage of protected areas in Europe on land and sea. As of 2020, there are a over 130 000 protected areas in the 38 EEA member countries. These sites cover over 1.27 million km\u00b2 or 22.7 % on land and approx. 570 000 km\u00b2 in the marine, covering 8.25 % of the sea. Within the EU 27 there are over 118 000 protected areas covering 1.06 million km\u00b2 or 25.7 % on land and approx. 556 000 km\u00b2 in the marine, covering 11.1 % of the sea.\nWith over 130 000 sites, Europe has more protected areas than any other continent in the world and amongst the highest proportion of its area covered by protected areas.\nProtected areas coverage across the world\nSources:\nUNEP-WCMC (2021). World Database of Protected Areas. March 2021.\nEEA, SEBI 007 (2020)\nThe protected area system in Europe is strongly influenced by the Natura 2000 network, with over 27 000 sites designated as Natura 2000 sites. Of the over 1.27 million km\u00b2 of European terrestrial surface covered by protected areas, over 760 000 km\u00b2 are part of the Natura 2000 network. This indicated, that even though national sites are predominant in numbers, the Natura 2000 network entails over 70 % of area covered by European protected areas, encompassing Europe\u2019s most representative sites. Marine Natura 2000 area covers an area of around 440 000 km\u00b2, equaling 8.8 % of the European protected area coverage on sea. As far as the terrestrial coverage is concerned, the Natura 2000 network is largely complete. The marine component of the network however is still largely incomplete in many countries, and mostly includes inshore waters, leaving the offshore waters with poor protection levels. Results show that despite the fact that coastal area makes up only a small part of the sea compared to the vast offshore waters, its marine protected area coverage is six times higher (EEA, 2018).\nThe new EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 requires EU Member States to further step up their conservation efforts to protect 30 % of both its land and sea cover by 2030, of which 10 % will have to be strictly protected. The CBD\u2019s post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will have a similar coverage target. This means that over the next decade there will be a need to expand the network in the EU, on land by about 4 % and in the seas by 19 %.\nMinimum of 30 % land and sea covered by protected areas by 2030\nLooking at the national level, the degree of protected area coverage is highly diverse. As of 2020, most countries have a terrestrial coverage of around 20 % (e.g. France, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia and Norway). The country with the highest coverage is Luxembourg with over 50 %. Countries like Bulgaria, Cyrus, Croatia, Estonia, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia have a coverage of around 40 %. However, in total numbers, France provides the highest terrestrial surface area, with close to 148 000 km2.\nMarine protected areas show an even higher margin of different coverages between European countries with access to marine waters. France (50 %) and Germany (45 %) are countries with a particular high share of marine area covered by protected areas and the (small) marine area of Slovenia even exhibits full coverage. In other countries, such as in Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, Italy, Ireland or Norway, the designation process lacks behind.\nThe coverage on national level is highly diverse, both on land and sea\nThe differences between countries can have various reasons and are highly country specific, ranging from a simple lack of resources or knowledge to complex designation issues. Looking at the Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Finland for instance, terrestrial land is only scarcely populated. Therefore, it is to argue whether vast regions need to be conserved by an official protected area designation.\nMore information on the progress of the Natura 2000 network and its coverage is available from the Natura 2000 Barometer and the Natura 2000 Network Viewer.\nOverlap\nThe degree of overlap between Natura 2000 sites and nationally designated sites illustrates the extent to which countries have made use of their nationally designated areas. It further underpins the dimensions on which Natura 2000 sites extend beyond national systems. Natura 2000 sites cover 72 % of the area of the protected areas network in the EU. Overall, the overlap between Natura 2000 and national designations amounts of 37 %, with Natura 2000 sites exclusively accounting for a further 35 % and with national sites covering a further 28 % exclusively.\nProportion of the protected areas network of the EU made up on national sites, Natura 2000 sites and the overlap between them\nSource: Marine protected areas. EEA Storymap 2018\nThere are different patterns among countries and the differences in approaches reflect the diversity of historical, geographical, administrative, political and cultural circumstances (as shown in the figure below). In establishing Natura 2000 sites, countries also have the flexibility to introduce new designation procedures, adapt existing ones or underpin designations by other legal acts. See the indicator SEBI 007 for more information.\nThe countries that joined the EU most recently \u2014 Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia \u2014 have extended their protected areas very significantly through creation of Natura 2000 sites, with little overlap. Similar situations exist in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia.\nGrowth\nEuropean protected areas have increased in number and area both on land and sea over the last number of years. In 2000, over 742 000 km\u00b2 of the terrestrial European territory (EEA38) was covered, by 2020 this figure has risen to over 1.27 million km\u00b2. In the marine realm, this figure has risen from approximately 90 000 km\u00b2 in 2000 to over 570 000 km\u00b2 in 2020. The withdrawal of United Kingdom from the EU in 2020, however, had considerable effects on the European protected area coverage, especially in the marine, with a loss of over 200 000 km\u00b2 of marine protected area.\nEEA38 terrestrial protected area growth between 2000-2018\nEEA38 marine protected area growth between 2000-2018\nEEA38 terretrial and marine protected areas growth 200-2018\nSource: Marine protected areas. EEA Storymap 2018\nMost of the protected area growth in the last 20 years in Europe can be attributed to the designation of Natura 2000 sites in the EU Member. On national level, the growth between 2000 and 2020 was highly diverse. On the one hand, there are numerous countries with a continuous rise along the years, others with sharp increases in single years. Austria, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Liechtenstein and Poland already started with a quite high area coverage which (more or less) steadily increased throughout the years. Other countries like Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, the Netherlands Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia chose a step-wise designation process in single years. For many of these countries, this is correlated with the year of accession to the EU.\nGrowth is even more pronounced for marine areas, where most countries, such as Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden had practically no or very few protected areas designated in 2000 and increased their area significantly within a few years. Other countries only showed marginal development throughout the period 2000-2020.\nRepresentativity\nEurope comprises eleven biogeographical regions that together inherit the continent\u2019s great terrestrial diversity. This diversity includes arctic polar deserts and boreal forests in the north, as well as the arid lands and dense mattoral of the south. It stretches from the steppic zones in the east to the extensive heathlands of the west. However, protected areas are not equally distributed among these regions. Whereas the Black Sea region is particularly well covered (68 %), the Boreal region (10 %) is underrepresented by protected areas.\nIn the marine realm there are four regions identified under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, with the North East Atlantic Ocean consisting of four sub-regions and the Mediterranean comprising of four sub-regions. The different regions, and sub-regions show a difference in the proportion covered by protected areas.\nProportion of each biogeographical region covered by protected areas\nMSFD Region\n% coverage\nBaltic Sea\n15.4\nNorth East Atlantic Ocean\n8.0\nBay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast\n16.4\nCeltic Seas\n8.5\nGreater North Sea, incl. the Kattegat and the English Channel\n28.0\nMacaronesia\n1.8\nMediterranean Sea\n8.9\nAdriatic Sea\n5.5\nAegean-Levantine Sea\n11.3\nIonian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea\n8.0\nWestern Mediterranean Sea\n9.2\nBlack Sea\n13.9\nThe European territory consists of a wide range of different terrestrial ecosystems. An analysis based on the MAES ecosystem grouping shows that forests (43 %) and agricultural land (42 %) are by far the two most dominant terrestrial ecosystems. The surface of inland water bodies (wetlands, rivers and lakes) is comparatively small.\nEuropean ecosystems exhibit different degrees of protected area coverage\nComposition of the EU by Ecosystem\nThe coverage of protected areas in Europe varies between the different groups of ecosystems. With 45 %, wetlands are by far the ecosystems with the highest share of protected area coverage \u2013 though the total area is comparatively small. Urban area on the other hand has\u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 the least coverage. As the most representative ecosystem, forests are protected less compared to the overall coverage of protected area in Europe.\nProportion of protected areas covering ecosystems\nIn some countries, protected areas cover the representative ecosystems well, as is the case for Austria, Luxemburg or Latvia, among others. Other countries have significant gaps between the ecosystem coverage and its share of protection. For example, while Ireland is mostly covered by grasslands and forbs, mosses or lichens (50 %), these are only poorly covered by protected area (below 15 %). Contrastingly, over 50 % of the Irish mires are covered. These figures may often reflect the national protection priorities, where most vulnerable ecosystems are purposefully targeted.\nOverseas countries & territories\nAround the world, the Europe (EEA38) includes 22 overseas entities: 9 Outermost Regions (ORs) and 13 Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). Present in every ocean and various biogeographical regions, they are home to a unique diversity of species and ecosystems of global significance, which are highly vulnerable to human impacts and increasingly the impacts of climate change. Europe overseas contain more endemic animal and plant species than are found on the whole of continental Europe, with New Caledonia alone having about as many endemic species as the European continent, and French Guiana including an area of Amazon rainforest the size of Portugal. Europe overseas also host more than 20 % of the world's coral reefs and lagoons (IUCN, 2020).\nOverseas entities are often small and very distant from the European continent, but together entail a high proportion of European biodiversity\nOCTs range from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, Southern Atlantic, Caribbean, the Arctic and Antarctic. These islands are small in either size or population and have constitutional relationships with the respective country. As they do not belong to EU territory, these Overseas Countries and Territories are not considered in the official European statistics on protected areas and are not governed by the EU environmental rules. However, they include considerable protected area coverage, mainly regarding Greenland with the largest terrestrial protected area in the world: the North-East Greenland National Park with a coverage of over 970 000 km2 as well as several large marine protected areas, such as New Caledonia\u2019s Parc Naturel de la Mer de Corail at nearly 1.3 million km2 or the 670 000 km2 R\u00e9serve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Fran\u00e7aise.\nName\nLand (% cov)\nMarine (% cov)\nAzores\n3.6\n24.5\nMadeira\n1.8\n59.8\nCanary Islands\n3.9\n46.8\nFrench Guiana\n1.0\n52.5\nGuadeloupe\n100\n69.7\nMartinique\n100\n65.3\nSaint-Martin\n100\n13.3\nMayotte\n100\n11.1\nReunion\n0.01\n63.1\nNine regions of the EU are further classified as ORs: five French overseas departments, the French overseas communities of Saint-Martin, the Spanish Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands and the Portuguese autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira.\nMost of the outermost regions have a terrestrial protected area coverage of around 50 %\nIn contrast to the Overseas Countries and Territories, these regions form part of the EU territory and its legal obligations. Most of these regions have a terrestrial protected area coverage of around 50 %. Full marine protection is achieved in Mayotte, Saint Mart\u00edn, Martinique and Guadeloupe, together covering an area of over 200 000 km2. Other countries, such as R\u00e9union, the Azores and French Guiana, show considerable potential for additional marine protected area designations.\nEfforts by the EU to foster protection in these regions is reinforced with its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 indicating specific actions. Existing EU programmes include the voluntary scheme of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Territories of European overseas (BEST) coordinated by IUCN and partners. Since its establishment in 2010, BEST aims to support the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of ecosystem services through the funding of small-scale and medium-scale field actions.\nDrivers for protected areas growth\nDrivers and reasons of protected area designations can be manifold. Nonetheless, the recent growth of protected areas in Europe can very frequently be attributed i) to the implementation of the EU Nature Directives and the objectives of the Natura 2000 and ii) to the Aichi Target 11 of the CBD\u2019s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. The growth characteristics of the European protected areas, for example, show that the accession to the EU had a significant influence on the respective protected area coverage. Generally, the positive effect of the Natura 2000 network are noticeable throughout all statistics in this report, as for example with regard to the degree of connectivity (see Connectivity) and the implementation of systematic management (see Management). So despite ongoing shortcomings, the Natura 2000 network has already contributed protecting a considerable share of European ecosystems and its species.\nReferences\n- EEA (2018).

Land resources are part of our shared natural capital and must be well managed to maintain a healthy environment and human well-being (EEA, 2019b). As such, only if land use and its impacts are properly addressed is progress towards sustainable development in Europe possible. Land-use related policies require the development of harmonised datasets, transparent methodologies and easily interpretable statistics. Land accounts fit the bill, describing how land resource stocks change over time. This briefing describes the use of the EEA\u2019s Integrated Data Platform and CORINE Land cover data for transparent, repeatable and efficient land accounting.\nLand is a resource that supports important production functions and ecosystem services, such as the provision of food and fibre, the maintenance of nutrient cycling, terrestrial biodiversity, water regulation and purification, and climate change mitigation (EEA, 2019a). The integration of land cover, land use and land use change data with other thematic areas is required to address the climate and environmental sustainability priorities of the European Green Deal and other EU policies.\nAt a global level, land degradation neutrality is included in target 15.3 of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs) and land use information underpins several other targets, e.g. SDG target 11.3 on sustainable cities and SDG target 15.1 on conservation, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems. Moreover, SDG target 15.9 addresses the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into accounting, among other things. More recently, the European Strategy for Environmental Accounts 2019-2023 describes priorities and actions for the use of environmental accounts in a harmonised way.\nThe EEA\u2019s approach to environmental accounting uses geospatial data and respects the international standards for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy, as set out in the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting \u2014 Central Framework. A separate briefing describes EEA\u2019s approach to developing ecosystem extent and condition accounts (EEA, 2020).\nAccounting is an economic term referring to the systematic process of communicating financial gains and losses (i.e. credit and debit). Land accounting therefore requires uniform and harmonised data on gains and losses in different land categories across the territorial extent in question. Such data come from the monitoring of land cover as seen from Earth observation instruments, such as satellites. Replacing economic assets in the accounts by land cover stocks means the shares of different land cover within spatial reporting units, and changes within them, can be quantified. Land cover changes can therefore be associated with socio-economic land use processes, and analysis of these changes enables us to evaluate pressures from land use change on the environment.\nThe EEA\u2019s land accounting is based on the Copernicus CORINE Land Cover (CLC) datasets for the years 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. CLC status layers for a given reference year (e.g. 2018) use mapping units of 25 hectares (ha), but CLC change datasets (e.g. from 2012 to 2018) capture changes at 5 ha. Therefore, simply subtracting one data set from another does not produce the CLC change dataset. In order to solve this, land cover accounting layers are created to produce a harmonised time series for the whole period 2000-2018 (ETC/ULS 2020).\nThe CLC data set has 44 classes and the number of potential unique land cover changes between two observation periods is large (i.e. 44*43 = 1 892). Grouping them into change categories known as Land Cover Flows (LCFs) provides transparent assessments, since the flow statistics between individual CLC classes or groupings give important insights into the nature of land cover change processes. LCFs are defined using three hierarchies that describe different land cover or land use change processes. Of these, level 1 is the most aggregated, containing nine LCF types (EEA, 2006).\nThe EEA\u2019s Integrated Data Platform (ETC/ULS, 2020) is made up of geospatial data architecture and IT system infrastructure to enable the consistent and systematic production of land and ecosystem accounts. In detail, the Spatial Data Infrastructure organises and catalogues geospatial data with an interactive interface. The thematic node Environmental Accounting Reference Layers (EARL) assembles harmonised and quality assured datasets. Interactive dashboards enable the exploration of geospatial datasets that describe our natural capital.\nThe IT infrastructure of the IDP contains the Joint Environmental Data Infrastructure (JEDI, ETC/ULS, 2020), which uses cloud infrastructure to transfer geospatial data into tabular formats (dimensions). Using data cubes, the dimensions of land cover datasets may be integrated with other dimensions, such as administrative boundaries, biogeographical regions or bio-physical and socio-economic data. For the integration, uniform reference grids are used with 1 km x 1 km and 100 m x 100 m cells as the accounting units, following INSPIRE directive specifications.\nA data cube allows for user driven queries and gives tabular, chart or map results. The EEA\u2019s own interactive dashboard for land accounts (EEA 2019c) displays the land stock and changes to it, detailing statistics by year and by geographical unit (Box 1). Moreover, the data cube allows for the efficient combination of various categories of a dimension (e.g. arable lands and permanent crops) or combinations of dimensions aggregated in grids or administrative boundaries.\nThe EEA\u2019s land cover change interactive dashboard enables land cover stocks accounting in Europe. It can be broken down by country and includes various selection choices: year of observation, classification hierarchy and breakdown by administrative or biogeographical region. By changing settings, the tables and charts change accordingly to display the chosen statistics. The \u2018Accounting for land cover changes\u2019 tab of the interactive dashboard provides assessments for the drivers of land cover change. Selecting LCF level 1 for the EEA-39 countries, for example, shows that in the period 2000-2018, 24 388 km2 of arable lands were transformed to some other land cover (i.e. Consumption), whereas 17 160 km2 of arable lands were added to the existing arable land stock (Formation). The difference in these values indicates that arable land decreased by 7 228 km2. The rows of the table break these changes down to the various LCF categories. This allows us to analyse the causes of losses and gains in arable land cover. For instance, the largest share of arable land consumption (6 222km2) happened because of growth in economic sites and infrastructure.\nSource: EEA\nLand take occurs when urban areas and sealed surfaces expand at the cost of more natural land cover types (EEA, 2019a), reducing the potential of the land to perform various functions and crucial ecosystem services (EEA, 2019b). The major factors behind land take in the EEA-39 region are industrial and commercial activities, and residential sprawl (EEA, 2019a) concentrated around larger urban agglomerations (Figure 1). In the EEA-39 in the period 2000-2018, 14 049 km2 was urbanised as indicated by the land take interactive dashboard, mostly at the expense of arable lands and permanent crops (around 50 % of the total urbanisation), and of pastures and mosaic farmlands (almost 30 %). Soil sealing \u2014 an extreme form of land take \u2014 covers lands with impermeable surfaces, resulting in a decline in land functions. Both land take and soil sealing have slowed down, although sealing less so: 1.7 % more of the land area was sealed in the period 2012-2015 (compared with an increase of 2.4 % in sealing between 2006 and 2009 in the EEA-39 region (see the soil sealing dashboard).\nLand recycling \u2014 the reuse of abandoned, vacant or underused land for redevelopment (EEA, 2018) \u2014 is still low in all European countries: on average, land recycling accounted for only 13.5 % of total land consumption in European cities in the period 2006-2012 (see land recycling dashboard). The largest component of land recycling is densification[1], i.e. when new urban development makes maximum use of urban space and existing infrastructure.\nSource: EEA\nThe area of arable land and permanent crops, a key component of CLC agricultural classes, has decreased in EEA39 by 7227km2 between 2000 and 2018 (land accounts). This is 0.5% decrease in the entire EEA-39 region with localised pattern (Figure 2): largest decreases in the range of 10-15 ha/km2 were seen in Czechia, Hungary, the central part of Spain, southern Portugal, as well as in Ireland and Estonia. The largest increases in the 5-15 ha/km2 range were observed in eastern Portugal, the south-western part of Spain and in central Finland. Figure 3 describes the share of various specific land cover changes contributing to losses of arable land and permanent crops. While in Hungary and Portugal the main driver was an increase in the forest and woodland area, in many other countries the main driver was the growth in economic sites and infrastructure.\nSource: EEA\nThe extent of forest areas in Europe is rather stable. During the accounting period 2000-2018, the forest area in the EEA-39 region grew by only 0.003 %, or 70 km2 (land accounts) Forest land cover change presented a regional pattern during the period 2000-2018, although this is a rather short period in terms of the full forest management cycle. There are clusters in eastern Europe, Ireland and southern Scotland, as well as in the Iberian Peninsula (Figure 4) where the extent of forest land cover is increasing. A decrease in forest land cover was observed in Finland and in the Mediterranean, for example in Greece, Croatia, Italy, Spain and Portugal (up to 15 ha/km2). Figure 5 presents the main factors behind local decreases in forest land cover. In Portugal and Spain, the dominant drivers of this decrease are forest fires and the conversion of forested areas to agricultural land. In Turkey, on the other hand, the spread of built up areas, such as economic sites and infrastructure, have driven local decreases in forest land cover.\nSource: EEA\nSource: EEA\nThe methods for land accounting described in this briefing will be further extended to other environmental topics for general geospatial environmental accounting. This will be facilitated by the Integrated Data Platform for the integration of diverse geospatial datasets. The methods are flexible and may be applied to any categorical geospatial data, while statistics can be broken down to any reference region, e.g. administrative NUTS units, river basins, floodplains (floodplains dashboard) or Natura 2000 areas (Natura2000 dashboard).\nWith the increasing number of Earth Observation products and their higher spatial and temporal resolution, improved capacity for big data processing is becoming a must. To provide policy support, the management and processing of such datasets must follow state-of-the-art standards and become automated, efficient and up-to-date. The EEA will further develop its geospatial environmental accounting system addressing big data cubes with regularly datasets from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service.\n1. Other land recycling processes: grey recycling \u2014 internal conversion between residential and/or non-residential land cover types \u2014 accounts for 3.2 % of total land consumption; green recycling \u2014 the development of green urban areas using previously built-up areas \u2014 is an important trend that reverses soil sealing, but it is a marginal process in all countries and, on average, it accounts for only 0.2 % of total land consumption.\nEEA, 2006, Land accounts for Europe 1990-2000 \u2014 towards integrated land and ecosystem accounting, EEA Report No 11/2006, European Environment Agency, accessed 2 March 2014.\nEEA, 2018, Land recycling and densification (LSI 008), European Environment Agency, accessed 29 May 2019.\nEEA, 2019a, Land take in Europe (CSI 014/LSI 001), European Environment Agency, accessed 28 August 2019.\nEEA, 2019b, The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020: knowledge for transition to a sustainable Europe, European Environment Agency, accessed 9 December 2019.\nEEA, 2020, \u2018Measuring the extent and condition of European ecosystems\u2019, European Environment Agency, forthcoming.\nETC/ULS, 2020, Land and ecosystem accounts for Europe.

Significant reductions in the rate of annual land loss to urban and infrastructure extension are therefore required from 2012 to 2020 if the 2020 objective is to be met. Key land take drivers and complementary data sources point to developments in the opposite direction (i.e. an increase in land take since 2012), making it unlikely that the objective will be met.\nFor further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.3 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2018\nThe Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes an objective that land is managed sustainably and promotes the objective of no net land take by 2050. Losing land to the development of buildings and other artificial surfaces affects biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services. Between 2000 and 2012, the average area of land taken for development in the EU was estimated to be 926 km2 per year. This is above the 800 km2 per year for 2000-2020 that was identified in the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe as an upper benchmark in order to stay on target to achieve the objective of no net land take by 2050. On average there was less annual land take in the latest assessment period (2006-2012) compared with the assessment period of 2000-2006. This is mainly because less land was taken for housing during the period 2006-2012. In order to stay on target, average land loss for the period 2012-2020 would have to be no more than 611 km2 per year. It is unlikely that such a drastic reduction in annual land take will take place in the years up to 2020. Complementary data sources show that land take accelerated between 2009-2012 and 2012-2015. In addition, key land take drivers \u2014 urban population, economic activity and transport activity \u2014 have been increasing since 2012, while at present there seem to be no further policy plans to drastically limit land take.\nThe 7th EAP includes an objective that land is managed sustainably and promotes the objective of no net land take by 2050 (EU, 2013). Agricultural land and, to a lesser extent, forests and other semi-natural and natural areas are lost to the development of buildings and other artificial surfaces. This leads to loss of fertile land and affects biodiversity as it decreases habitats \u2014 the living space of important species \u2014 and fragments the landscapes that support and connect them. Land occupied by man-made surfaces and dense infrastructure is also a significant source of water, soil and air pollution. The sealing of land by these surfaces can also have a negative impact on the water balance and increase the frequency and intensity of flooding. Land take is also a matter of land use efficiency and an aspect of the wider land degradation issue, which is addressed by the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015), particularly goal 15.3 on land.\nThere is no specific objective in the environmental acquis that matches the 7th EAP objective of sustainable land management and the promotion of no net land take by 2050. However, the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) states that 'if we are to reach the state of no net land take by 2050, following a linear path, we would need to reduce land take to an average of 800 km2 per year (for the EU) in the period 2000-2020'. This average figure is used in this briefing as the benchmark to assess progress. In the 2000-2012 period, the estimated average annual land take for the EU was 926[1] km2 (1 073 km2 for the EEA-33[2]) (EEA, 2017), which is considerably above the level required to achieve the long-term objective of no net land take. However, estimated average annual land take decreased from 1 048 km2 (1 148 km2 for the EEA-33) per year in the 2000-2006 period to 848 km2 (1 043 km2 for the EEA-33) per year in the subsequent 2006\u20132012 period (EEA, 2017).\nBased on the average for the EU-28 during the 2006-2012 assessment period, 52 % of all areas that changed to artificial surfaces were arable land or permanent crops in 2006 (47 % for the EEA-33) (Figure 1). Pastures and mixed farmland were the next most taken category of land, representing 26 % of the total (27 % for the EEA-33), while forests and transitional woodland shrub made up 14 % (16 % for the EEA-33). A similar pattern emerged in the 2000-2006 period.[3]\nAs these land cover types are substituted to varying degrees by impervious cover, the provision of important services provided by soils, such as storing and filtering water, and the transformation of nutrients and contaminants deteriorates. This specific issue is discussed in more detail in the soil section of the EEA report The European environment \u2014 State and outlook 2015 (EEA, 2015).\nFrom the perspective of the types of development that occur on the land that is taken, at the EU level, the largest area (33 %) was taken by construction sites between 2006 and 2012. These sites represent transitional areas that will turn into some form of urban development in the future. The second largest area (24 %) was taken for industrial and commercial sites. The proportion of newly created mines, quarries and dumpsites was 19 % in the EU-28, while housing, services and recreation made up 18 % of the overall increase in urban and other artificial areas. Although land take for transport infrastructure is underestimated in the Corine Land Cover dataset, it still covered 7 % of the area taken. A similar pattern emerges when looking at all 33 EEA member countries (EEA, 2017).\nOverall, during the 2000-2012 period, land take in the EU was shaped by the increased urban population (Eurostat, 2016), economic activity, increased mobility and growth in transport infrastructure; and a number of other drivers, such as the increasing demand for living space per person. Comparing 2000-2006 and 2006-2012 shows that the reduction in land take in the second period was primarily due to less land being taken for housing. At the EU level, between 2000 and 2006, housing, services and recreation took the largest area (32 %), contributing to urban sprawl, while between 2006 and 2012, the same land category was only the 4th largest land take area \u2014 a 53 % decrease in terms of km2.[4]\nRegional urbanisation rates vary substantially (see Figure 2), with coastal and mountainous regions among the most affected because of the increasing demand for artificial surfaces related to transport, recreation and leisure in these areas.\nFigure 2. Spatial development of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries\nData source: EEA, Spatial development of landtake\nAs the proportion of land used for production (agriculture, forestry, etc.) in Europe is one of the highest in the world, conflicting land use demands require decisions that involve difficult trade-offs. The decisions on trade-offs between land uses are effectively implemented through spatial planning and land management practice in the individual countries. Although the subsidiarity principle assigns land and urban planning responsibilities to national and regional governments, most European policies have a direct or indirect effect on land planning and urban development. Where properly implemented, the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA; EC, 2001) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA; EC, 2014) Directives can improve the consideration of environmental aspects in spatial planning.\nThe average annual land take between 2000 and 2012 lay above the trajectory required to achieve the long-term goal of no net land take. However, annual land take declined between the 2000\u20132006 and 2006\u20132012 observation periods. The EU could reach the required trajectory if the amount of land taken reduces significantly during the period 2012-2020 \u2014 i.e. to no more than 611 km2 per year on average. It is unlikely that such a reduction in the annual land take will take place in the years up to 2020. Complementary data sources from the land use/cover area survey (LUCAS) statistics (Eurostat, 2017) show that land take accelerated between 2009-2012 and 2012-2015. In addition, key land take drivers \u2014 urban population, economic activity and transport activity \u2014 have been increasing since 2012, while at present there seem to be no further policy plans to drastically limit land take. It is therefore unlikely that the 2020 objective of keeping the rate of land take below 800 km2 on average per year from 2000-2020 would be achieved.\nOne way to reduce the rate of land take in future is through the redevelopment of brownfield land. Brownfield sites are derelict and underused or even abandoned former industrial or commercial sites, which may have real or perceived contamination problems (EC, 2012). These sites are mainly found in urban areas of industrialised regions. Redevelopment of brownfield sites gives many environmental advantages: relieving pressure on rural areas and greenfield sites, reducing the costs of pollution, allowing more effective use of energy and natural resources and facilitating economic diversification. Another way to reduce the rate of land take in future is through higher density development, i.e. more buildings or a higher population on a given area of land (EEA, 2016). However, the compact urban form can and should come with improved quality of life, a reduction in climate change risks and the implementation of environmental and human health standards.\nFigure 3 shows the mean annual rate of land take in the EEA-39 countries \u2014 the 33 EEA member countries (including the 28 EU Member States) and the six EEA cooperating countries \u2014 between 2006 and 2012. The graph ranks countries according to increases in land take as a percentage of the initial artificial land stock in 2006. Perhaps surprisingly, the countries with the highest percentage of land take include those that are already highly urbanised and therefore had an already high initial percentage of artificial land stock in 2006. Countries that enjoyed strong economic growth between 2006 and 2012 also had high levels of land take, indicating the need for further decoupling.\nNote: EEA-39 comprises the 39 countries presented in this chart. These are the member countries of the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the EEA cooperating countries.\nIf the urban population of Europe continues to grow, the pressure to develop on natural and semi-natural land will continue. If the objective of no net land take by 2050 is to be met, future developments should increasingly either take place on brownfield land or fill in gaps between existing developments (densification), or land take should have to be compensated for by returning artificial land to agricultural, forest or semi-natural land cover types. Such developments could be driven by establishing incentives for 'land recycling', e.g. encouraging developers to use brownfield land or for encouraging spatial planning that favours increasing urban density. The extent to which land take can be reduced in the longer term will also be influenced by the ability of the EU and individual Member States to coordinate their spatial planning and environmental protection objectives.\nThe indicator shows the amount of land that is converted from natural and semi-natural areas (including forested and agricultural areas) to artificial surfaces used for urban and economic purposes. It includes areas sealed by the construction of buildings and infrastructure, as well as pit mining, urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities.\nThe indicator is based on the interpretation of satellite imagery from 2000, 2006 and 2012 (the most recent) and ancillary data by the countries. The main dataset (Corine Land Cover) used by the indicator does not map features with an area of less than 25 ha (5 ha for change) and less than 100 m across. This leads to the exclusion of small areas of land and small changes due to man-made features, particularly in the peri-urban countryside. It also means that land taken by linear transport infrastructure (e.g. roads and railways) is underestimated, as it is too narrow to be picked up. On the other hand, land take areas accounted for contain unsealed surfaces such as suburban gardens and other smaller green plots.\n[1] Differences in the EU estimated average annual land take figures for 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2000-2012 in this briefing compared with the 2016 version of the briefing are due to some re-submissions as well as the use of an improved accounting methodology (ETC-ULS, 2016).\n[2] EEA-33 comprises the 28 EU Member States and the 5 non-EU countries that are member of the European Environment Agency (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey).\n[3] In the EU (EEA-33), over the 2000-2006 period, 49 % (47 %) of all areas that changed to artificial surfaces were arable land or permanent crops, 29 % (29 %) were pastures and mixed farmland and 13 % (14 %) were forests and transitional woodland.
