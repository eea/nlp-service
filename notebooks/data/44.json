knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\niii \n\nExecutive Summary \n\nPurpose \n\nThe purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the movements of waste between EU \n\nMember States (MSs) by broadening the knowledge base, describing the dynamics and the drivers behind \n\nthese movements and assessing the overall environmental benefit and risks that the movements bring \n\nto the overall EU waste management system. The work can be structured under the following three \n\nquestions: \n\n1. What can the available data tell us about the intra EU shipments of Waste? \n\n2. What drives and constrains these waste movements? \n\n3. What are the environmental benefits of these waste movements? \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nThis report has involved extensive data extraction and analysis \u2013 using a novel combination of statistics \n\non trade in waste (Comext) plus statistics on the generation, treatment and disposal of waste from \n\nEurostat. The report also involved literature review and a small number of interviews with key \n\nstakeholders from the waste industry. \n\n \n\nThe work has primarily focussed on non-hazardous (recyclable) waste streams but also covers some \n\nhazardous streams, in order to make use of the available data and to reflect the environmental benefits \n\navailable from recovering resources from hazardous waste. \n\n \n\nWhat can the available data tell us about the intra EU shipments of Waste? \n\nThe table below presents total waste generated, excluding major mineral waste generation, compared \n\nto total waste imports and exports both within the EU and with third countries in millions of tonnes. It \n\nis apparent that transboundary shipments remain a small percentage of total waste generated, with \n\nover 90% of wastes generated treated within the Member States themselves, with transboundary \n\nmovements representing a small percentage by total volume.  \n\n \nTable 0-1: Total EU waste generation, intra EU and Extra EU waste exports \n\n 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 \n\nTotal EU waste generated (excl. \n\nmajor mineral wastes) \n781 790 760 759 758 770 785 809 \n\nTotal waste exported (extra-EU) 18.6 19.5 24 30 32 28 29 31 \n\nTotal waste imported (intra-EU) 42 44.5 46.4 46.4 46.4 46.4 45.3 49.2 \n\nNote: imports and exports are calculated on the bases on CN codes reported to the COMEXT database, see Annex A.  \n\n \n\nThe economy and location of the countries plays an important role in their exports of imports of waste. \n\nCountries such as BE, NL and LU are generally transport hub countries, which is likely to account for \n\ntheir proportionally higher levels of exports of wastes than countries of a similar size in terms of \n\npopulation and economy. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of the patterns in the waste streams considered key to the circular economy, as they are the \n\nmost resource rich (i.e. recyclable) revealed the following:  \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\niv \n\n\u2022 Plastic waste:  Some Member States (FR, DE and SE) consistently rely on exports whilst others \n\nappear to be expanding their imports (most notably CZ, and RO). \n\n\u2022 Glass waste: Some Member States (BE, EL, HU, NL, RO, SE and SI) consistently rely on exports, \n\nwhilst others appear either to be expanding their imports of glass waste overall (most notably \n\nCZ) or are large destinations for glass waste overall (DE and PT). \n\n\u2022 Textile waste: Some Member States (AT, BE, DE, FI, FR, PT and SE) consistently rely on \n\nexports, whilst others are generally net importers of textiles waste (most notably BG, ES, HU, \n\nIT, LT, NL, PL and RO). \n\n\u2022 Non-ferrous metals: There are a significant volume of shipments originating from or entering \n\nDE, and the difference between imports versus exports is relatively small. DK, FR and NL are \n\nthe Member States that export the largest volumes and export more non-ferrous metal waste \n\nthan they import, whereas AT, ES and IT show increasing trends of net volumes imported \n\nincreasing over time. \n\n\u2022 Ferrous metals: IT, BE, ES and LU appear to be the overall countries of destination for ferrous \n\nmetal wastes from other EU Member States. DE, FR and NL appear to rely more heavily on \n\nexports to other Member States of their ferrous metal wastes. Imports into Italy are reported \n\n(industry interview) as being relatively high due to the high use of electric arc furnaces in iron \n\nand steel production in Italy, and these are capable of using a much higher proportion of waste \n\nmaterial than blast furnaces (which are more common in German steel making plants). \n\nGermany appears to be the MS with largest volume of ferrous waste moving into and out of the \n\ncountry. This reflects Germany\u2019s position as the largest steel maker in the EU, they accounted \n\nfor over 40M tonnes of crude steel production in 2019 (25% of crude steel production in the \n\nEU). With net exports of just under 3.5M tonnes, exports of ferrous metal waste represent just \n\nunder 10% of total production. When compared with FR (with 14.5M tonnes of crude steel \n\nproduction in 2019), net exports as a percentage of production in FR are 30% of total \n\nproduction. \n\n\u2022 Paper and cardboard: AT, DE, ES, HU and NL appear to be the overall countries of destination \n\nfor paper and cardboard wastes from other EU Member States.  CZ, DK, FR and PL appear to \n\nrely more heavily on exports to other Member States of their paper and cardboard wastes. \n\n\u2022 Refuse derived fuel, other wastes from mechanical treatment and mixed municipal waste \n\nfor energy recovery and incineration: DE and SE are net importers of these wastes for R1 and \n\nD10 activities but that the proportions imported are a small fraction of the total wastes \n\nsubject to these activities. However, for SK, imports are an important fraction of the total \n\nfeedstocks for R1 and D10 capacity. Conversely, IE and to a lesser extent SI are heavily reliant \n\non exports for the incineration of their wastes. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the value of Intra EU waste shipments, the COMEXT database reports waste shipments \n\nboth by quantity and value (see below for data on selected key recyclable streams).  \n\n \nTable 0-2: Total value of exported intra-EU recyclables in 2019 \n\n \n\nPaper and \n\nCardboard Textiles Plastics Glass \n\nNon-ferrous \n\nmetals \n\nFerrous \n\nmetals TOTAL \n\nValue (million Euro) \n1,260 682 557 113 1,227 8,379 12,217 \n\n \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\nv \n\nThis data has been analysed to compare the relative performance of Member States in the types and \n\nvalue of waste they export and import. To illustrate this, and to compare two contrasting MSs in terms \n\nof GDP and resource use, the data for Germany and Bulgaria were compared. This comparison indicates \n\nthat Germany imports higher-value waste compared to Bulgaria in ferrous metals, paper and cardboard, \n\ntextiles and plastic, whereas Bulgaria imports higher value material in non-ferrous metals. Glass waste \n\nimports appear to have a similar value in the two countries. The analysis also shows that the ratio \n\nbetween waste exported and generated tends to be much higher in Germany compared to Bulgaria. This \n\nsuggests a more independent waste management system in Bulgaria, which is able to cope with a larger \n\nshare of its waste without resorting to shipping it to third countries. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the treatments that intra-EU waste shipments receives the analysis is constrained by \n\nthe data. The Comext (trade) data does not specify the treatments that the waste receive. The \n\nEurostat (WSR/Basel) data does give some information on waste treatment but does not cover non \n\nnotifiable waste shipments and some of the waste classifications it provides lack detail. Looking at the \n\nEurostat (WSR/Basel) data: \n\n\u2022 Eight member states (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, Italy, Austria \n\nand Ireland) are the main waste exporting countries for the highest volume Basel-coded waste \n\ncategories. \n\n\u2022 Most of the top 10 exporting member states are also listed in the individual MS\u2019s top three of \n\nreceiving countries. This shows that the MSs cannot be categorised into receiving and exporting \n\ncountries, but rather can be grouped into MSs that transfer high volumes of waste among each \n\nother, and others that are less involved in intra EU waste movements; \n\n\u2022 Cross-border shipments of these flows, which mostly consist of hazardous waste, mainly go to  \n\nneighbouring countries. \n\n\u2022 Looking at the eight MSs\u2019 who export most notifiable waste, some have also specialised in the \n\ntreatment of specific waste streams, and account for the treatment of more than half of the \n\nnotified waste categories with the highest volumes transferred between EU member states. It \n\ncan be observed that three MSs (Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany), are the main \n\nproviders of treatment for 19 out of the 24  notified waste streams with the highest volumes \n\ntransferred. Five other MSs (Denmark, France, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain) are the main \n\ntreatment providers for the other five notified waste streams with the highest volumes \n\ntransferred.  \n\n \n\nWhat drives and constrains these waste movements? \n\nArticles 11 and 12 of the WSR allow MSs to impose restrictions on the import of certain waste streams \n\nfor disposal or recovery..  \n\n \n\nThe MSs which import the most waste for disposal or recovery purposes are Germany, the Netherlands, \n\nFrance, and Sweden. They have very little to no restrictions on waste imports, which matches with the \n\nhigh trend of imports these countries have within the time period analysed (2013-2018). The first three \n\ncountries import waste either from each other or from Italy, Luxembourg or Austria. Sweden received \n\nmore waste from extra-EU countries (Norway and United Kingdom).  \n\n \n\nThe level of effectiveness of waste import restrictions in accordance with Article 11 and 12, WSR, is \n\ndifficult to confirm. The largest waste flows for disposal or recovery purposes occur between large and \n\ncentrally located countries which have no, or only partial restricting, measures in place. Following the \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\nvi \n\nreported implementation of new restriction measures the volumes imported by smaller countries \n\nchanged only slightly or showed no correlation. This lack of apparent impact could relate to data \n\nlimitations (the broad scope of Eurostat data and time period limitations), or smaller treatment and \n\nimport levels. Therefore, no clear conclusion on the effectiveness of waste import restriction measures \n\ncan be drawn. \n\n \n\nThe literature suggests that drivers for shipping waste can be categorised into the following, five \n\ngroups.: \n\n\u2022 Economic: Include issues related to minimising the costs of treatment or disposal and \n\ntransport. These include gate fees or taxes for sending waste to incineration plants. The cost \n\nand efficiency of transport also plays a key role -as it does for the transport of any material. \n\n\u2022 Regulatory; It is important to clarify that the administrative burden associated with regulation \n\ndoes not typically block shipments. Its typical impact is to increase waiting times and costs of \n\nshipments that ultimately decreases profit margins and / or slows resource movement. \n\n\u2022 Technical; Mainly relating to the presence or not of sufficient infrastructure to deal with all \n\nwaste treatment and recycling needs within a country\u2019s boundary.  \n\n\u2022 Geographic: Related to transport costs and infrastructure.  \n\n\u2022 Environmental: Regarded as relatively minor by waste companies and closely related to \n\neconomic and regulatory drivers. \n\n \n\nThese drivers cannot simply be ranked, although economic drivers always appear to be the most \n\nimportant, and there is clear interplay between the drivers. We have attempted to summarise and \n\ncapture the influential factors and different considerations that waste holders face in a decision-tree. \n\nThe decision tree for any specific waste is specific to it and influenced by legal, operational and \n\neconomic considerations. Therefore, it should be stressed that this decision tree is only intended to \n\nillustrate the drivers, and how they interact with each other, and it cannot capture every option for \n\nevery waste stream. \n\n \n\nThe first option facing a waste holder is if they wish to comply with the law or not. If not, the decision \n\nwill be to pursue the cheapest option, with environmental considerations playing no role. \n\n \n\nAssuming the waste holder wishes to comply with the law (which will apply to all the waste captured in \n\nthe statistics), the first question is if the waste is green-, or amber-listed, or if it can actually be \n\ndefined as a resource according to \u2018end of waste\u2019 definitions. In the case of green-listed waste, a \n\nsuitable recovery facility has to be found, either within the country of origin or outside. If the facility is \n\nlocated in another MS, it also has to be checked if the respective MS imposes any restrictions on the \n\nimport of the waste in question. Once options are clear, factors, such as transports costs and value of \n\nthe resource, will determine where the waste will finally go for disposal or recovery.  \n\n \n\nIn order to reduce administrative costs for shipments which require notification an important \n\nconsideration is whether the destination facility is pre-consented. This would make future shipments \n\nsignificantly faster as consents can last for three years not one. Consenting multiple shipments as \n\nopposed to each individual shipment is another cost saving approach waste holders pursue. \n\n \n\nThe next consideration cluster relates to practical and operational factors (orange) which decide on the \n\ntransport mode and method for the shipment. Thereafter, the economic considerations (yellow) relate \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\nvii \n\nto treatment costs (gate fees and taxes). Depending on the waste type, the decision arrives at options \n\nrepresenting either the minimisation of costs (for disposal) or maximising revenue through recovery. \n\n \nFigure 0-1 Decision-tree for intra-EU waste shipments \n\n \n\nSource: own table \n\n \n\nWhat are the environmental benefits of these waste movements? \n\nIntra EU (and any other) waste movements can provide environmental and circular economy benefits \n\nby: \n\n\u2022 Enabling the increased recycling of waste into secondary raw materials that effectively are \n\nused as a substitute for primary materials in production processes, thus avoiding the \n\nresource consumption and associated environmental impacts from primary production; \n\n\u2022 Providing safe sinks for substances and materials contained in wastes, that could damage \n\nhuman health and/or the environment, and should be kept out of new production loops. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of the environmental benefits of intra EU waste movements requires information on the \n\nnature of the waste, its potential for recycling or recovery, and the treatment that will be given at \n\ndestination. Datasets on waste that is traded as goods use trade codes to classify the waste in different \n\nproduct categories (Comext), movements of wastes that are notified because of their potential hazard \n\n(Eurostat (Basel/WSR data)) including an indication on the type of treatment that is intended on \n\nreception. The Basel notified data (Eurostat) thus provides more precise information on the treatment \n\nprovided, but is less specific on the waste characteristics and the potential for recycling or recovery. \n\nCOMEXT data has more detail on the characteristics of the waste and its secondary raw material \n\npotential, but does not specify the actual treatment at destination.  \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\nviii \n\nTotal volumes of intra-EU waste streams were analysed in terms of environmental performance level \n\n(EPL) for the six MSs which collectively account for approximately 70% of the total import or export of \n\nthese streams: Germany, The Netherlands, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria. Both for the non\nhazardous, CN-coded waste streams traded as goods (Comext data), and for the notified waste streams \n\nsubject to the Basel Convention (Eurostat data). From the analysis, it is clear that: \n\n\u2022 Both for the non-hazardous, CN-coded waste streams traded as goods, and for the notified \n\nwaste streams subject to the Basel Convention, the more environmentally beneficial treatment \n\noptions (R treatment codes) are favoured over the less beneficial ones (D treatment codes) as \n\nthe disposal treatment options (D) represent around 10% of the final treatment quantity of \n\nexported waste \n\n\u2022 The largest volumes of wastes that are moved between MSs usually go to the more beneficial \n\nwaste treatments; \n\n\u2022 Much larger volumes of waste are treated within MSs than are exported to other MSs.  \n\n\u2022 Volumes of waste traded and documented in the Comext database are much higher than the \n\nvolumes of (hazardous) waste transported with Basel notification; \n\n\u2022 The Countries most active in moving notified wastes are equally active in the trade of non\nhazardous waste and waste-related goods. \n\n \n\nExport will always be more complex and more burdensome as compared to local processing, so it a \n\nreasonable assumption that waste will not be (legally) exported without having a motive that makes it a \n\nmore valuable choice than local treatment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n1 \n\n1 Introduction \n\n1.1 This report  \n\nThis report presents the final outcomes of the project \u2018Expanding the knowledge base on intra-EU \n\nwaste movements in a circular economy\u2019 for the European Environmental Agency (EEA). The project has \n\nbeen developed in collaboration with Trinomics, Wood, Vito and Ricardo. Wood and Trinomics were \n\nresponsible for Task 2 (mapping of waste movements within the EU), Trinomics developed Task 3 \n\n(Drivers motivating waste movements within the EU) and Vito led Task 4 (Environmental benefits and \n\nrisks from intra-EU waste movements).  \n\n \n\n1.2 Overview of the project and its objectives \n\nThe purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the movements of waste between EU \n\nMember States (MSs) by broadening the knowledge base, describing the dynamics and the drivers behind \n\nthese movements and assessing the overall environmental benefit and risks that the movements bring \n\nto the overall EU waste management system. The work can be structured under the following three \n\nquestions: \n\n1. What can the available data tell us about the intra EU shipments of Waste? Covering: \n\na. mapping of waste movements within the EU to understand what waste is shipped intra-EU, \n\nwhere MSs send their waste and how it is treated at the final destination; \n\nb. particular data gaps on green listed waste between EU MSs (their origin, volume and type \n\nof shipments) and how it is treated / disposed of. \n\n2. What drives and constrains these waste movements? Covering: \n\na. compiling a list of restrictions for waste imports based on Article 11 and 12 of the WSR;  \n\nb. identifying drivers motivating waste movements within the EU to comprehend \n\nthe decision-making process and criteria considered by the holders of waste. \n\n3. What are the environmental benefits of these waste movements? Covering: \n\na. defining environmental benefits and risks from intra-EU waste movements. \n\nb. the extent to which current waste shipment practices and volumes align with the \n\nEuropean Commission\u2019s Circular Economy objectives \n \n\n1.3 Scope of this study \n\nThe geographical scope of this study covers all 27 EU Member States and EEA members.  \n\n \n\nThe scope of waste data considered includes all intra EU waste movements including hazardous and \n\nnon-hazardous waste. The most relevant waste streams for this study are the non-hazardous waste \n\nstreams (ferrous metal waste, non-ferrous metal waste, paper waste, plastic waste, textile waste, glass \n\nwaste) as these represent the largest potentials in enhancing the Circular Economy within the EU. \n\nHowever, in two sections, waste treatment volumes and environmental benefits of waste movements, \n\nwe have also included some analysis of hazardous waste streams. This has been done to make full use \n\nof the available data and to reflect the fact that environmental benefits are available from recovering \n\nresources from hazardous waste streams. \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n2 \n\nThe data that is used for the most detailed analysis is the most recent that is available (typically at \n\nleast 2016-2018), but where there are longer time series available, and there is a benefit in showing a \n\nlonger trends older data has been presented. \n\n \n\n1.4 Structure of this report \n\nThis report is structured as follows:  \n\n\u2022 Chapter 2 provides an overview of the political context and scope of this study; \n\n\u2022 Chapter 3 presents and analyses the data on the volume of intra EU waste movements, their \n\nvalue and their treatment; \n\n\u2022 Chapter 4 covers WSR Article 11 and 12 restrictions (as they are a possible restriction on intra \n\nEU waste movements); \n\n\u2022 Chapter 5 presents and analyses drivers motivating waste movements within the EU; \n\n\u2022 Chapter 6 attempts to analyse the environmental benefits and risks from intra-EU waste \n\nmovements; \n\n\u2022 Chapter 7 summarises the results.  \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n3 \n\n2 Background \n\n2.1 Policy background \n\nThe identification of the possible adverse impacts of waste shipments on the environment and public \n\nhealth dates back to the 1970s/1980s. The increase in the production of waste, combined with the \n\ndevelopment of a globalised economy, has led to growing volumes of waste being shipped across \n\nborders. Several events showed the potential harm to the environment and public health that \n\nshipments of waste (especially hazardous waste) could generate, in the absence of rules designed to \n\nensure that it is carried out safely and with appropriate controls.  \n\n \n\nThe need for international action to address this issue was recognised as one of the three priority areas \n\nin the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s (UNEP) first Montevideo Programme on Environmental \n\nLaw in 1981. \n\n \n\n2.1.1 The Basel Convention \u2015 a global legal response \n\nFollowing on from UNEP prioritising the control of waste shipments to mitigate their environmental \n\nimpacts in 1981, the negotiations for the elaboration of a global convention on the control of \n\ntransboundary movements of hazardous wastes commenced. Negotiations concluded in March 1989 with \n\nthe adoption of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes \n\nand their Disposal (the Basel Convention). The Convention entered into force on 5th May 1992. Covering \n\na wide range of wastes defined as \u201chazardous wastes\u201d based on their origin and/or composition and \n\ncharacteristics, as well as two types of wastes defined as \u201cother wastes\u201d \u2015 household waste and \n\nincinerator ash, the Convention has the following three main aims: \n\n1. Reducing hazardous waste generation and the promotion of environmentally sound \n\nmanagement of hazardous wastes, wherever the place of disposal; \n\n2. Restriction of transboundary movements of wastes except where it is perceived to be in \n\naccordance with the principles of environmentally sound management; \n\n3. A regulatory system applicable where transboundary movements are allowed. The regulatory \n\nsystem is based on the concept of prior informed consent. It requires that, before export may \n\ntake place, the authorities of the State of export notify the authorities of the prospective \n\nStates of import and transit, providing them with detailed information on the intended \n\nmovement. The movement may only proceed if all States concerned have given their written \n\nconsent. In the event of a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes having been carried \n\nout illegally, or if it cannot be completed as foreseen, the Convention attributes responsibility \n\nto one or more of the States involved, and imposes the duty to ensure safe disposal, either by \n\nre-import into the State of generation or otherwise.  \n\n  \n\n2.1.2 The OECD Decision \u2015 an OECD international response \n\nOECD Council Decision C(92)39/FINAL on the Control of Transfrontier Movements of Wastes Destined for \n\nRecovery Operations addresses transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations \n\nbetween member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \n\nwith the intention of ensuring their environmentally sound and economically efficient management.   \n\n  \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n4 \n\nImportantly, and arguably the main reason for its continued existence, the Decision also applies to \n\ntransboundary movements of recoverable wastes between OECD member countries in cases where an \n\nOECD member country is not a Party to the Basel Convention \u2015 this is particularly important for the US \n\nas a non-Party to the Basel Convention.   \n\n  \n\nThe OECD system, which has been amended over time to take into account developments in the Basel \n\nConvention, is based on two control procedures:  \n\n1. Green Control Procedure: for wastes presenting a low risk for human health and the \n\nenvironment and, therefore, not subject to any other controls than those normally applied in \n\ncommercial transactions;  \n\n2. Amber Control Procedure: for wastes presenting sufficient risk to justify their control.  \n\n  \n\nThe principal procedural differences from the Basel Convention under the OECD include time limits for \n\napproval processes, tacit consents and pre-consent procedures.  \n\n \n\n2.1.3 The EU Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) \u2015 the EU response \n\nThe European Community originally introduced measures on the supervision and control of shipments of \n\nwaste in 1984 under Council Directive 84/631/EEC. The Directive took effect from 1 October 1985 and \n\ncovered shipments of hazardous waste. It required prior notification to the countries involved, thereby \n\nallowing them to object to a specific shipment. The Directive was amended by Council Directive \n\n86/279/EEC of 12 June 1986, which introduced additional provisions in order to improve the monitoring \n\nof exports of waste out of the Community. These initial legislative instruments were significantly \n\nhampered by delayed, incomplete or failure to transpose the legislation at all in some Member States.  \n\n  \n\nIn 1990, following international developments in the context of the Basel Convention and the OECD, the \n\nCommission put forward a proposal for a Waste Shipment Regulation with the Basel Convention and, \n\nlatterly, the 1992 OECD Decision forming the main pillars of the resulting 1993 Regulation, applicable as \n\nof 6 May 1994. The move to a Regulation rather than a Directive was aimed specifically at addressing \n\ntransposition and implementation issues encountered in the original Directive.  \n\n  \n\nAs both the Basel Convention and OECD Decision have evolved over time it has been necessary for the \n\nRegulation to be amended to take into account these developments. Problems with the Regulation \n\nidentified in its operation within the EU have also led to changes. The Regulation applies to shipments \n\nof waste:  \n\n\u2022 Between EU countries within the EU or transiting via non-EU countries;  \n\n\u2022 Imported into the EU from non-EU countries;  \n\n\u2022 Exported from the EU to non-EU countries;  \n\n\u2022 In transit through the EU, on the way from or to non-EU countries.  \n\n  \n\nThere are two control procedures for the shipment of waste:  \n\n1. general information requirements: applicable to shipments for\u202frecovery\u202fof wastes, listed in \n\nAnnex III (\u2018green\u2019 listed wastes: non-hazardous, such as paper or plastics) or IIIA; and  \n\n2. prior written notification and consent -\u202ffor other types of shipments of wastes, including:  \n\na. shipments of wastes listed in Annex IV (\u2018amber\u2019 listed wastes containing both hazardous \n\nand non-hazardous parts) or in Part 2 of Annex V (European list of wastes, e.g. wastes \n\nfrom mining, quarrying and physical and chemical treatment of minerals); and   \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n5 \n\nb. shipments for\u202fdisposal\u202fof wastes listed in Annex III (\u2018green\u2019 listed wastes).  \n\n \n\nIn applying the Regulation all parties involved must ensure that waste is managed in an environmentally \n\nsound manner, respecting EU and international rules, throughout the shipment process and when it is \n\nrecovered or disposed of. Exports to non-EU countries of waste for\u202fdisposal\u202fare prohibited, except to \n\nEFTA countries that are party to the Basel Convention and exports for recovery of\u202fhazardous waste\u202f(i.e. \n\nthat pose a risk to human health and the environment) are prohibited, except those directed to \n\ncountries to which the OECD decision applies. Finally, imports from non-EU countries of waste \n\nfor\u202fdisposal or recovery\u202fare prohibited, except for imports from countries to which the OECD decision \n\napplies, from non-EU countries that are party to the Basel Convention, from countries that have \n\nconcluded a bilateral agreement with the EU or EU countries or other areas during situations of crisis.  \n\n \n\nSeveral difficulties and/or gaps have been identified in the implementation of the WSR. Those applying \n\nto intra-EU waste shipments are: \n\n\u2022 Data quality \u2015 discrepancies have been identified in relation to quantities of waste reported \n\nby countries of dispatch and countries of destination; \n\n\u2022 Classification of wastes \u2015 despite the sharing of experiences between Parties to the Basel \n\nConvention on the use of Basel codes for the classification of waste and similar experience \n\nsharing between EU Member States on the use of European Waste List Codes the classification \n\nof waste remains inconsistent across the EU;  \n\n\u2022 Illegal shipments \u2015 despite improvements in inspection practices across Member States, \n\nincluding those expected from 2016 as a result of Regulation (EU) No 660/2014, the level of \n\nshipments of waste in violation of the WSR appears to remain relatively high; \n\n\u2022 Reporting by MSs \u2015 compliance with reporting deadlines continues to demonstrate differing \n\nperformance by Member States.1 \n\n \n\nIn order to address these difficulties and to further integrate enabling principles for the Circular \n\nEconomy \u2015 in particular the abiding principle of treating the waste as closely as possible to its source \n\nto achieve highest environmental outcomes (the proximity principle), the WSR is currently being \n\nreviewed in line with the European Commission\u2019s better regulation guidelines. \n\n \n\n2.2 The efficient functioning of waste markets in the EU \n\nThe WSR must not only ensure protection of the environment in relation to shipments of waste but also \n\nforms the main legislative instrument through which the EU meets its commitments under multilateral \n\nenvironmental agreements. Its implementation to date has, however, not been without difficulty. This \n\nis rooted in the following main reasons: \n\n\u2022 differing interpretations of the definition of 'waste', diverging classifications of waste as \n\n'hazardous' or 'non-hazardous' and the application of national end-of-waste criteria; \n\n\u2022 Waste Shipment Regulation's rules, e.g. the notification requirements and provisions \n\nconcerning shipments through transit countries; \n\n\u2022 the capacities for waste treatment, differing taxes or fees, and non-harmonisation of \n\nEnhanced Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes; \n\n \n1 European Commission (2019) Study supporting the evaluation of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of \nwaste, Final report, p. 26 \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n6 \n\n\u2022 the lack of EU-wide enforcement of waste legislation and the lack of a policy that either bans \n\nor severely discourages landfilling. \n\n \n\nIn order to address these challenges, a study on \u2018The efficient functioning of waste markets in the \n\nEuropean Union\u20192 suggested eight recommendations. \n\n1. Develop Schengen area for waste for recycling and recovery. \n\n2. Harmonise and strengthen the system of pre-consented facilities. \n\n3. Ensure more harmonised classification system for waste shipments. \n\n4. Facilitate waste shipments through an electronic system for notification (and information) \n\nrequirements. \n\n5. Address delays in shipping waste via transit countries. \n\n6. Address problems of cooperation between authorities at different levels. \n\n7. Upgrade waste management systems in the EU. \n\n8. Improve enforcement in MS. \n\n \n\n2.3 Circular economy and waste shipment \n\nCircular economy policy response \n\nThe first and second Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), published in 20153 and 20204 respectively, \n\ninclude, inter-alia, a stepping up in the enforcement of the WSR and measures to facilitate waste \n\nshipment across the EU.  \n\n \n\nThe most recent CEAP, released under the European Green Deal, aims to ensure that resources used are \n\nkept in the EU economy as long as possible. This includes enabling intra-EU waste movements which \n\nsupports the application of the Waste Hierarchy while discouraging extra-EU shipments. For instance, \n\nsecondary material markets are intended to stimulate increased and better-quality recovery waste \n\nmaterials. Waste exports can result in negative environmental and health impacts in the countries of \n\ndestination due to treatment which does not comply with environmental standards or with the concept \n\nof circularity. Every waste export is also a potential loss of resources and economic opportunities for \n\nthe recycling industry in the EU or MS. Recent import restrictions introduced by some third countries \n\nhave exposed the dependence of the EU on foreign waste treatment, but they should also help mobilise \n\nthe recycling industry to start increasing its capacity and adding value to waste in the EU. \n\n \n\nSince the adoption of the Basel Convention, the EU has successfully created a Single Market for Goods \n\nand Services. Primary materials and products can flow easily and without controls across intra-EU \n\nborders. However, the Single Market for the Circular Economy is still a work in progress. The free \n\nmovement of primary, but not secondary raw materials, was fully justified when the dominant method \n\nof waste treatment was disposal, however as this becomes less the case there is good reason to revisit \n\nenvironmental agreements and regulation related to waste shipment. \n\n \n\nCircular economy approach to waste shipment \n\nCircular economy strategies and policies expect material recycling and energy recovery from wastes to \n\nresult in environmental benefits, which in turn, lead to increased sustainability of the production and \n\n \n2 European Commission (2016) The efficient functioning of waste markets in the European Union\u2014Legislative and \npolicy options.

However, this requires recycled materials and energy from waste to substitute for \n\nprimary material and energy production. Lack of displacement will significantly reduce the \n\nenvironmental benefits.  \n\n \n\nFrom this perspective it is possible in a circular economy context to pragmatically categorise waste that \n\nis exchanged between EU MS into three groups. This categorisation is not strictly related to the legal \n\nstatus of both the waste (good, end-of-waste, hazardous waste, chemical waste, etc.) or to the \n\noperations used for processing (e.g. recovery and disposal codes): \n\nA. Wastes of which the material content can be partly recovered, at a competitive cost, and \n\nwithout the use of processes or methods likely to harm the environment, as secondary raw \n\nmaterials that meet material and/or product specifications, as well as health and quality \n\nstandards, required to satisfy a market demand and substitute for primary raw materials. \n\nOften, but not always, the corresponding waste-related industrial feedstocks have a positive \n\nvalue and are traded as goods that are reported according to the Combined Nomenclature (CN\ncodes). Examples of such wastes are paper and cardboard, end-of-life vehicles, glass, some \n\nconstruction and demolition wastes, metal scrap, sewage sludge, batteries, waste oil, plastic \n\npackaging, ashes, etc. Wastes that are used in processes that combine the use of material \n\nproperties with the delivery of heat, e.g. feedstock recovery in blast furnaces; \n\nB. Wastes of which the energy content can be partly or completely recovered, without \n\nendangering human health and without the use of processes or methods likely to harm the \n\nenvironment. These wastes are typically used as a fuel or other means to generate energy. An \n\nexample of such wastes are the millions of tonnes of refuse derived fuel (RDF) and solid \n\nrecovered fuel (SRF) that are exported from the UK; \n\nC. Wastes that are not recyclable and/or that contain hazardous substances of which the \n\nreintegration into subsequent production cycles should be avoided. These wastes, or their \n\nhazardous content, should be processed with appropriate methods and directed towards safe \n\nsinks. \n\n \n\nUsing this categorisation, it is possible to map the waste-based production systems that are expected to \n\ncontribute to both circular economy and environmental objectives, by converting nationally produced \n\nand imported wastes into secondary raw materials that are used as a fuel or as material resources in \n\nnew industrial production cycles. For those waste streams that are traded as goods, which is \n\npresumably the most important category from a circular economy point of view, values in euro are also \n\navailable, in addition to the volumes in tonnes. By combining data on value and volume, quality \n\ndifferences can be observed between exchanged waste flows. It is safe to assume that the more the \n\nvalue of a waste-related good approximates the value of the supposedly substituted primary raw \n\nmaterial, the less processing will be required and/or the better the quality of the exchanged waste \n\nstream. \n\n \n\n2.4 Waste shipment mapping approaches to-date \n\nUnderstanding the transboundary waste shipment conditions requires thorough modelling of waste \n\nflows. A number of approaches have been used to examine waste flows both intra- and extra-EU. \n\nHowever, there is no single approach that provides a comprehensive method to address all waste flows, \n\nboth hazardous and non-hazardous, broken down to the level of the European List of Wastes (ELoW) \n\nwithin the EU. The most relevant approaches are summarised below. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n8 \n\n \n\n2.4.1 ETC paper on Transboundary Shipments of Waste in the EU \n\nThe European Topic Centre (ETC) working paper examined the availability of data, methodologies and \n\ninformation on their drivers and environmental impacts in relation to Transboundary Shipments of \n\nWaste. Although now somewhat dated (the paper was issued in 2010), a number of the following \n\nconclusions reached remain valid: \n\n\u2022 The majority of hazardous waste generated within the EU was treated within the countries of \n\ngeneration with only 9% of hazardous waste generated exported, primarily to other EU MS; \n\n\u2022 The reporting based on the Basel Convention Y codes provides insufficient detail on the types \n\nof waste shipped and their reason for shipping; \n\n\u2022 Reporting based on the ELoW codes would provide more detailed information on waste types \n\nthan the Basel reporting. However, at the time of the report, only 11 MSs published data on \n\ntransboundary shipments of waste according to the ELoW codes, with an additional 9 holding \n\ninformation that was not published on the basis of the ELoW codes. \n\n \n\nMore recently, data reported at the ELoW level has been made available by MSs. However, this only \n\naddresses movements that fall within the scope of the Basel Convention and therefore largely ignores \n\nnon-hazardous shipments of waste. Given that non-hazardous wastes generally include those wastes \n\nmost likely to be of value in respect to recovery and reuse this leaves a significant shortcoming in \n\nrespect to accessing waste shipment data at a level that provides enough granularity to be of value. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 European Reference model on Municipal Waste Management \n\nThe European Reference Model on Municipal Waste Generation and Management was originally \n\ndeveloped to support the impact assessment for the review of waste targets proposed in the 2015 \n\ncircular economy package. It addresses municipal waste generation and management, including waste\nflow scenarios coupled with calculations of related costs and benefits. \n\n \n\nThe model does not address waste shipments. In relation to municipal waste management, key drivers \n\nfor shipments are disparities in treatment capacities and differences in gate fees, neither of which are \n\nincluded in the model.   \n\n \n\nFurthermore, a rather significant gap in relation to the model is that it only addresses municipal waste \n\ngeneration and no other wastes. Given that municipal waste only accounts for about 10% of waste \n\ngenerated when compared with data reported according to the Waste Statistics Regulation, the model \n\nprovides insufficient coverage of the waste types we need to address in this study. \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Eurostat waste data \n\nUnder Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 on waste statistics (as amended) (the Waste Statistics Regulation) \n\nMSs must submit data on waste. The Regulation specifies how waste should be reported, categorising \n\nwaste types according to the ELoW into certain reporting categories. Note that there are discrepancies \n\nbetween this Regulation, the ELoW as it is presented in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC and the \n\nCommission Notice on technical guidance on the classification of waste (2018/C 124/01). This means \n\nthat reporting under the Waste Statistics Regulation on different waste types may not correlate with \n\nwaste streams identified according to the ELoW in the Commission Notice, meaning that for certain \n\ncategories wastes may be under reported in total, or data could be hard to correlate with how shipped \n\nwaste is actually classified on the ground. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n9 \n\nAdditionally, there are a number of Directives that require the measurement and reporting of data on \n\nparticular waste streams, namely: \n\n\u2022 Batteries; \n\n\u2022 End of life vehicles; \n\n\u2022 Hazardous waste; \n\n\u2022 Municipal waste; \n\n\u2022 Packaging and packaging waste; \n\n\u2022 Waste electrical and electronic equipment. \n\n \n\nShipments of waste between countries are also addressed in Eurostat reporting. However, the reporting \n\nsuffers from some of the same difficulties identified in the European Topic Centre Working Paper in \n\n2010. These difficulties include that the data is not generally addressed at the ELoW level. This is \n\nlargely because the results are used for reporting under the Basel Convention, so the Basel codes are \n\nused and these do not fully align with the ELoW definitions. \n\n \n\n2.4.4 European international trade in goods statistics \u2015 COMEXT \n\nIn relation to customs controls and data on the trading of goods, the use of combined nomenclature \n\n(CN) codes data is collected in the Comext database. Comext is Eurostat's reference database for \n\ndetailed statistics on international trade in goods. It provides access to: \n\n\u2022 Recent and historical data of the EU and its individual MS; \n\n\u2022 Statistics of a significant number of non-EU countries.  \n\n \n\nThe data is captured in two different ways within COMEXT: \n\n1. Extrastat: data on trade in goods with non-EU countries are collected by custom authorities \n\nand are based on the records of trade transactions in customs declarations. The dataset on \n\ntrade with third parties is considered particularly robust as it is based on all reported customs \n\nmovements; \n\n2. Intrastat: When the EU was created and the original MSs became part of the EU Single Market, \n\ncustoms and border formalities were removed. The dismantling of customs clearances and \n\ncontrols within the EU meant it was no longer possible to obtain information about the \n\nmovement of goods (i.e. dispatches and arrivals) between EU MSs from customs documents. In \n\norder to address this gap in data the statistical system Intrastat was developed to replace the \n\ncustoms declarations and collect information directly from traders about dispatches and \n\narrivals of goods among the MSs by collecting data directly from intra-EU trade operators once \n\na month. \n\n \n\nThere are a number of points in relation to Intrastat data in particular that may be considered short \n\ncomings, albeit minor in relation to the overall quality of the data available. These shortcomings \n\ninclude: \n\n\u2022 Businesses and private individuals that are registered for VAT purposes and that dispatch or \n\nreceive goods are required to submit Intrastat declarations if the dispatches or the arrivals \n\nexceed the relevant threshold; \n\n\u2022 The Intrastat system is based on EU Regulation No. 638/2004 (EU Regulation), supplemented \n\nCommission Regulation (EC) No. 1982/2004, which implements the EU regulation. Since the \n\nmain Intrastat rules are provided in the Regulation the rules should normally be applied \n\nuniformly across the EU.  However, there are differences in implementation as some MSs \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n10 \n\nprovide guidelines on how the general principles in the Regulation should be applied in specific \n\nsituations (e.g. commercial samples, return of goods, etc.). Consequently, these guidelines \n\nmay produce different results for various situations in EU MS; \n\n\u2022 The authorities responsible for Intrastat reporting differ from country to country. Some \n\nMSs delegate oversight of Intrastat to their tax or customs authorities, others to their statistics \n\noffice and still others to their national bank. The nature of reporting by each MS may, \n\ntherefore, vary. \n\n \n\nCOMEXT has recently been used by Eurostat in the development of a publication on movement of waste \n\nfrom and into the European Union. The publication includes a presentation of export and imports \n\nfrom/to the European Union of ferrous metal, paper, other wastes, plastics, copper, aluminium, and \n\nnickel scrap, textiles, wood, animal and vegetable waste, municipal waste, glass and precious metal \n\nscraps. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, COMEXT not only includes information of the volume of materials traded but also their \n\nvalue. The value of the goods can be expressed in two ways: \n\n\u2022 The taxable amount or invoice value, which is the value to be determined for tax purposes in \n\naccordance with the EU VAT Directive (Directive 2006/112/EC); and \n\n\u2022 The statistical value, which is the value calculated at the national borders of the EU MS. It is \n\nbased on the taxable amount or, where applicable, the value replacing the taxable amount. It \n\nincludes incidental expenses (freight, insurance) incurred in the case of dispatches for the part \n\nof the journey located in the territory of the EU MS of dispatch. In the case of arrivals, it is the \n\npart of the journey located outside the territory of the EU MS of arrival. The statistical value is \n\nsaid to be an FOB value (free on board) for dispatches, and CIF (cost, insurance, freight) for \n\narrivals. \n\n \n\nValues are also allocated to the waste streams reported under Comext, albeit the reliability of these \n\nvalues is something that is commented on elsewhere in this study. \n\n \n\nOne of the difficulties in working with Comext in relation to waste movements is that the CN codes are \n\nchanged frequently. A new version of the \u2018Combined Nomenclature\u2019 is published twice a year. \n\nTherefore, it has to be checked whether changes of waste-related CN codes have taken place. Changes \n\ncan include the introduction of new codes, the elimination of codes, the split of codes or the \n\naggregation of codes. Eurostat maintains a master file with the CN codes relevant for waste transfers \n\nthat is updated annually.  \n\n \n\nA challenge, therefore, in respect to the use of CN codes to identify waste shipments is that the \n\ncategorisation does not sit neatly with Basel Codes, the ELoW and the Commission Notice on the ELoW \n\nas referred to above.   \n\n \n\nAn examination of the codes used by Eurostat undertaken by Wood (as part of the work on the WSR \n\nImpact Assessment whose publication is pending) indicates that in certain cases the choice of CN codes \n\nto be used to identify wastes falling under the above broad categories may be difficult to justify. For \n\nexample, the CN codes include a general category \u20183915 Waste, parings, and scrap of plastics\u2019. \n\nHowever, the category \u2018plastics\u2019 for the above-mentioned publication includes rubber materials that \n\nfall under Chapter 40 of the CN codes and are typically not considered \u2018plastic waste\u2019 on the ground. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n11 \n\nWhilst the Commission Notice on ELoW includes a single category that includes rubber and plastics, it is \n\nconsidered that the categories of rubber included in the Eurostat master file are likely to be broader \n\nand include materials that would not typically be considered as plastics waste in the context of the \n\noperation of the Waste Shipments Regulation. \n\n \n\nThe modelling approach being applied under the exploration of potential policy responses to \n\nreview the Waste Shipment Regulation \n\nNoting the pros and cons mentioned above of existing approaches to collecting data on waste shipments \n\nthe model developed and applied under the study exploring potential policy response to review the \n\nWaste Shipment Regulation addresses the following categories of waste shipment flows: \n\n\u2022 All hazardous waste; \n\n\u2022 All non-hazardous (excluding mixed municipal waste), ferrous metal waste, non-ferrous metal \n\nwaste, paper waste, plastic waste, textile waste, glass waste. \n\n \n\nMixed municipal waste is not included in the model. Furthermore, the approach using CN codes means \n\nthat there is not a direct correlation with the ELoW codes generally used for reporting movements of \n\nwaste. \n\n \n\nThe totals for hazardous and non-hazardous waste are taken from env_wasship. In respect of the \n\nspecific waste flows (ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, paper, plastic, textiles and glass), the \n\napproach takes COMEXT data for both extra and intra-EU movements. Whilst other waste flows could \n\nalso have been included, given the size of data and nature of the study being undertaken a selection of \n\nwaste flows has been considered more reasonable. \n\n \n\nIt is acknowledged that there is not a perfect alignment in the categorisation of wastes under this \n\napproach with that applied under the ELoW. However, it is considered that overall, the reliability of \n\nthe Comext dataset in terms of reporting warrants its use in this case. Note that under the \n\nabovementioned study, the costs and benefits of changes in flows will be gathered. For the purpose of \n\nthis EEA study it is understood that the two main data elements required are quantity and value. \n\nConsequently, the cost element being developed under the European Commission study would be of less \n\nrelevance for this EEA project.  \n\n \n\f\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n13 \n\n3 Mapping of waste movements within the EU \n\n3.1 Distribution of waste flows in the EU \n\n3.1.1 Method  \n\nThe core of the method is to use the outcomes of the model using COMEXT trade statistics developed by \n\nWood for the current WSR IA project work for the European Commission. This model (and our approach \n\nfor this work) uses a stream by stream approach, and provides a suitable basis for categorising waste \n\n(which includes what might be classified as \u2018tradeable secondary raw materials - that would not be \n\npicked up as waste (in waste statistics), because they are accepted as meeting \u2018end of waste criteria\u2019) \n\nmovements and movement of waste between MSs for the period 2016-2019. The model also includes \n\ninformation on what might be classified as \u2018tradeable secondary raw materials\u2019. Some of these \n\nmaterials would not be considered as waste e.g. in waste statistics, because they are accepted as \n\nmeeting \u2018end of waste criteria\u2019. The full list of COMEXT CN codes is provided in Annex 5.  \n\n \n\nIn addition to these, there are some other waste / resource flows that have been mentioned by the EEA \n\nas being of potential interest to this study \u2013 whether because of their known high volume and the \n\neconomic relevance of associated capital investments and trade-related financial transactions5 (e.g. \n\nrefuse derived fuel (RDF) or value as resource (e.g. textiles)). There are also other streams that are of \n\npotential interest (e.g. industrial slags, sludges, ashes). However, bearing in mind the limits for the \n\nstudy, it is not possible to cover all waste streams of potential interest. This was further addressed in \n\nthe interim meeting for the project where reference was made to notified wastes i.e. those wastes \n\nsubject to notification under the WSR. During that meeting it was referenced that a large spreadsheet \n\nalready exists in relation to notified waste, the latest version of which can be found on the Eurostat \n\nwebsite6. The Agency noted that duplication of the information held in this sheet was not the aim of \n\nthe model to be developed and that, instead, the focus should be on Comext waste data. \n\n \n\nThe selection of waste streams has been made by an initial identification of reliable data on \n\nmovements of wastes. In this context the work of Eurostat on wastes traded between Member States for \n\nrecycling has been used as the starting point to identify those wastes of greatest interest. The dataset \n\non trade in recyclable raw materials by waste held by Eurostat that uses Comext data builds on work \n\nundertaken by the JRC to identify the most relevant wastes from a circular economy perspective \u2013 \n\nplastic, paper and cardboard, precious metal, iron and steel, copper, aluminium and nickel. This list of \n\nwastes was then used to develop a long list of materials for consideration, alongside additional ferrous \n\nmetal wastes, all non-ferrous metal wastes and textiles, thereby addressing by weight the vast majority \n\nof wastes not addressed in the env_wasship dataset referred to above. This list was then discussed with \n\nrepresentatives of the JRC, Eurostat and the European Commission, following which the final set of \n\nwastes to be considered were agreed and used in the model for intra- and extra-EU shipments of these \n\nwaste materials. \n\n \n\nThe model has been developed and shared with the EEA. The results presented below look at shipments \n\nby weight and by EUR value using the results of the model. \n\n \n5 Let\u2019s recycle (2019) RDF exporters \u2018face \u00a350m cash drain\u2019 after Brexit; Let\u2019s recycle (2019) Dutch \u2018RDF tax\u2019 faces \ncritical vote  \n6 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/9/9f/WshipR_LoW_Statistics_explained_Dec-20.xlsx \n\nhttps://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/rdf-exporters-face-50m-cash-drain-after-brexit/\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n14 \n\n3.1.2 Limitations \n\nThe use of data from Comext for the purpose of assessing shipments of wastes is subject to some \n\nlimitations (as described in the context chapter) including: \n\n\u2022 Businesses and private individuals that are registered for VAT purposes and that dispatch or \n\nreceive goods are required to submit Intrastat declarations only if the dispatches or the \n\narrivals exceed the relevant threshold. Smaller shipments, therefore, are not captured by \n\nthose declarations. \n\n\u2022 The Intrastat system is based on EU Regulation No. 638/2004 (EU Regulation) and \n\nsupplemented Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1982/2004, which implements the EU \n\nregulation. Since the main Intrastat rules are provided in the Regulation the rules should \n\nnormally be applied uniformly across the EU. However, there are differences in \n\nimplementation as some Member States provide guidelines on how the general principles in the \n\nRegulation should be applied in specific situations (e.g. commercial samples, return of goods, \n\netc.). Consequently, these guidelines may produce different results for various situations in EU \n\nmember states. \n\n\u2022 The authorities responsible for Intrastat reporting differ from country to country. Some \n\nMember States delegate oversight of Intrastat to their tax or customs authorities, others to \n\ntheir statistics office and still others to their national bank. The nature of reporting by each \n\nMember State may, therefore, vary in approach accordingly. \n\n\u2022 The value of the goods can be expressed in two different ways that may lead to discrepancies \n\nin the EUR values allocated, being: \n\no The taxable amount or invoice value, which is the value to be determined for tax purposes \n\nin accordance with the EU VAT Directive (Directive 2006/112/EC); and \n\no The statistical value, which is the value calculated at the national borders of the EU \n\nMember States. It is based on the taxable amount or, where applicable, the value \n\nreplacing the taxable amount. It includes incidental expenses (freight, insurance) incurred \n\nin the case of dispatches for the part of the journey located in the territory of the EU \n\nmember state of dispatch. In the case of arrivals, it is the part of the journey located \n\noutside the territory of the EU member state of arrival. The statistical value is said to be \n\nan FOB value (free on board) for dispatches, and CIF (cost, insurance, freight) for arrivals. \n\n\u2022 CN categorisation does not sit neatly with Basel Codes, or the European List of Waste. \n\n\u2022 An assumption has been made that ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, plastic, paper and \n\ncardboard and textiles wastes identified in this study are subject to transboundary shipment \n\nfor the purpose of recovery. Comext does not provide information on the fate of these \n\nmaterials at the point of destination. However, it is also clear that some of these materials \n\nwill be rejected. In this context the following data has been found in respect to likely \n\nrejection rates for these materials at the point of treatment. \n\n \nTable 3-1: Sources of data on typical waste processing residue values \n\nWaste type Residue percentage Source of value \n\nGlass 8% \nEunomia 2019 - Study to support the implementation of reporting \n\nobligations resulting from the new waste legislation adopted in 2018 \n\nPlastic 30% \nEunomia 2019 - Study to support the implementation of reporting \n\nobligations resulting from the new waste legislation adopted in 2018 \n\nPaper and \n\ncardboard \n10% \n\nEunomia 2019 - Study to support the implementation of reporting \n\nobligations resulting from the new waste legislation adopted in 2018 \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n15 \n\nWaste type Residue percentage Source of value \n\nTextiles 10% \nNorup et al 2019 - Evaluation of a European textile sorting centre: \n\nMaterial flow analysis and life cycle inventory \n\nNon-ferrous \n\nmetals \n19% \n\nEunomia 2019 - Study to support the implementation of reporting \n\nobligations resulting from the new waste legislation adopted in 2018 \n\nFerrous \n\nmetals \n19% \n\nEunomia 2019 - Study to support the implementation of reporting \n\nobligations resulting from the new waste legislation adopted in 2018 \n\n \n\nFurthermore, in relation to the use of waste shipment data (was_trd), the information does not provide \n\ninformation in respect to the EUR value of materials shipped. By way of example, this study has looked \n\nto identify the EUR value of RDF shipments within the EU. However, no definitive source of this \n\ninformation has been found, and ultimately the value appears to represent the lower cost of sending \n\nRDF for R1 and D10 treatment and disposal in comparison to landfilling, with R1 and D10 generally \n\napplying where the costs involved are lower than the costs of landfilling.   \n\n \n\n3.2 Intra-EU waste movements by weight \n\nThis section considers the volumes of weights of non-hazardous wastes against the categories of plastic, \n\nglass, textiles, non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, paper and cardboard and totals of these wastes \n\ncombined. These have been presented as it is considered that these are the materials of greatest \n\ninterest to the European Environment Agency \u2013 given their relevance to the circular economy (i.e. they \n\nare recyclable). \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Plastic wastes \n\nThe figures below present reported export (reported as an export from the Member State concerned) \n\nand import (reported as an import into the Member State concerned) data for plastic wastes for \n\nMember States for the years 2016-2019. \n\n \nFigure 3-1 Intra-EU exports of plastic waste by Member State \n\n \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nAT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE EL ES FI FR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK\n\nTh\no\n\nu\nsa\n\nn\nd\n\ns \no\n\nf \nto\n\nn\nn\n\nes\n\nMember State\n\nIntra-EU exports of plastic waste by Member State\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019\n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n16 \n\nIt is apparent from the figure above that for certain Member States (AT, DE, EL, HR, and SI) the trend is \n\nfor increasing export of plastic waste to other EU Member States.

IT, BE, DE, ES, NL and LU are largest importers of ferrous metal \n\nwaste by weight. Imports into Italy are reported (industry interview) as being relatively high due to the \n\nhigh use of electric arc furnaces in iron and steel production in Italy, and these are capable of using a \n\nmuch higher proportion of waste material than blast furnaces (which are more common in German steel \n\nmaking plants). \n\n \n\nAn examination of net values (considering imports versus exports) is presented below. \n\n \nFigure 3-15 net shipments of ferrous metals waste by Member State \n\n \n\n \n\nIT, BE, ES and LU appear to be the overall countries of destination for ferrous metal wastes from other \n\nEU Member States.

This more clearly shows the net exporters and net \n\nimporters of the wastes concerned within the EU. The nature of the countries plays an important role in \n\nthese figures. Countries such as BE, NL and LU are generally transport hub countries, LU as a result of \n\nits location amongst a number of large Member States and BE and NL as a result of the rail and port \n\ninfrastructure in those countries that undertake a considerable share of transboundary shipments of \n\nwaste both within the EU and between the EU and third countries. This is likely to account for their \n\nproportionally higher levels of exports of wastes than countries of a similar size in terms of population \n\nand economy.   \n\n \n\n3.2.8 Movements of RDF, other wastes and MSW for energy recovery and incineration \n\nOur examination of shipments of waste within the EU of notified wastes has focussed on the following \n\nwaste codes: \n\n\u2022 19 12 10 combustible waste (refuse derived fuel); \n\n\u2022 19 12 12 other wastes (including mixtures of materials) from mechanical treatment of wastes; \n\n\u2022 20 03 01 mixed municipal waste. \n\n \n\nThe idea behind the examination is to identify the main importers and exporters of these wastes for the \n\npurpose of energy recovery R1 or disposal D10. A consideration of the total amount of waste subject to \n\nR1 and D10 in each Member State has also been included in order to identify the importance of imports \n\nand exports of these wastes for incinerator operations in the EU. \n\n \n\nThe figure below looks at R1 and D10 treatments employed in the EU by weight of non-hazardous \n\nwastes generated. \n\n \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n31 \n\nFigure 3-22 Volumes of non-hazardous waste subject to R1 and D10 activities in the EU 27 2010-2018 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe general trend across all Member States that operate R1 and D10 activities is a general increase in \n\nwastes subject to those treatments between 2010 and 2018.  However, the figure does not separate out \n\nwaste generated within the Member State themselves and those wastes imported or exported from \n\nother Member States. \n\n \n\nIn order to consider the importance of transboundary movements of wastes for Member States in \n\nrelation to R1 and D10 activities an examination of imports and exports of wastes 19 12 10, 19 12 12 \n\nand 20 03 01 has been undertaken for all Member States. This allows the identification of those  \n\nMember States that are net exporters and net importers of wastes for the purpose of R1 and D1 \n\nactivities. This is shown in the figure below where positive values show net imports are higher than \n\nexports and negative values showing the opposite. \n\n \nFigure 3-23 Net balance of shipments of 191210, 191212, 200301 wastes within the EU-27 2010-2018 \n\n \n\n \n\nSome countries are generally net importers of the wastes concerned such as DE, SE and SK.

However, for \n\nSK, imports are an important fraction of the total feedstocks for R1 and D10 capacity. Conversely, IE \n\nand to a lesser extent SI are heavily reliant on exports for the incineration of their wastes. The results \n\nfrom this figure are different in comparison to assessments that have been made in the past such as the \n\nEEA report from 2012 on movements of waste across the EU\u2019s internal and external borders. The main \n\ndifference in volumes results from the UK having left the EU, with the UK having previously been an \n\nimportant exporter of RDF to EU Member States. \n\n \n\n3.3 Prices attributed to the waste movements \n\n3.3.1 Method \n\nThe attribution of prices to waste movements varies considerably by waste type. In some cases, market \n\ndata on the value of wastes and of secondary materials that obtained an end-of-waste status is \n\nrelatively easy to obtain. For example, this is the case for steel scrap (see the market reporting under \n\nthe metal bulletin metalbulletin.com). For others, the value is more difficult to obtain.  \n\n \n\nThe treatment of many waste streams by third parties abroad is often associated with a cost to be paid \n\nfor by the exporter. Such negative pricing is common not only for hazardous wastes that are exported \n\nto be treated and/or disposed in (an)other MS, but also for waste or waste derived materials, such as \n\n-100.00%\n\n-50.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n50.00%\n\n100.00%\n\nAT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE EL ES FI FR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK\n\nPercentage of transboundary shipments of 101210, \n191212 and 200301 in comparison to total non-hazardous \nwaste subject to R1 and D10 in the EU-27 from 2010-2018\n\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n33 \n\nRDF or construction aggregates, from which the importer will recover the calorific or material value to \n\nan economic benefit. \n\nCOMEXT includes value data against movements of certain types of waste that can be extracted on a CN \n\ncode basis, therefore allowing a greater degree of granularity in terms of values. At the same time, the \n\nEurostat data on trade in recyclable raw materials by waste8 contains import and export values both in \n\ntonnes and \u20ac covering 2010 to 2019 for the categories of \u2018total waste\u2019 \u2018plastics\u2019 \u2018paper and cardboard\u2019 \n\n\u2018iron and steel\u2019 \u2018precious metals\u2019 \u2018copper, aluminium and nickel\u2019 with the CN codes used to determine \n\nsuch categories defined by Eurostat to aid ease of understanding9.

This observation can be used to derive conclusions on the quality differences between the \n\nexported and imported waste of the same CN code.

Though we also consider some other waste streams of interest (as they \n\ncould potentially be recycled more, and/or may increase into the future, e.g. textiles. Refuse derived \n\nfuel (RDF) are also of interest as they are of the waste streams most commonly shipped within Europe.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Values of EU shipments to MS \n\nThe COMEXT database reports waste shipments both by value and quantity. Therefore, by combining \n\nthe two it is possible to deduce the value per weight of the waste shipments by individual waste code \n\nor broader waste category. A useful metric to map the value of waste moved within the EU is to look at \n\nhow this varies across different MSs for the same waste category, that is analysing the value of EU \n\nwaste exports to different MSs. This allows an identification of which countries receive high-value \n\nwaste and which low-value waste. The charts below present this analysis for each waste category for \n\n2019 shipments using data for all months as an average. The original COMEXT data for value and \n\nquantity was reported by each waste code, and these have been added up to obtain total values and \n\nquantities for each waste category. Finally, the total value has been divided by the total quantity, \n\nobtaining values of waste shipped expressed in euro per tonne. It is important to note that there are \n\nseveral possible reasons behind some MSs presenting very high values for certain waste categories and \n\nwe have not been able to fully investigate these in this study. For example, one reason for these \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n35 \n\noutliers may be that a MS only imports waste belonging to a specific high-value waste code, whereas \n\nother MSs are more focussed on low-value waste or a combination of the two. \n\n \nFigure 3-26 Value of EU ferrous metals waste shipments exported to other EU MSs (\u20ac/t, 2019) \n\n \nSource: Own elaborations based on COMEXT data \nNote: Luxembourg is included in data for Belgium \n\n \n\nWithin the ferrous metal category, IE is a clear outlier.

Bulgaria and Germany were \n\nchosen as they have contrasting GDP and resource consumptions, to analyse how the EU shipments of \n\neach waste category to the two MS vary in value. Figure 3-32 shows the results of the comparison. \n\n \nFigure 3-32 \u2013 Value of EU waste shipments to Bulgaria and Germany (\u20ac/t, 2019) \n\n \nSource: Own elaborations based on COMEXT data \n\n \n\nThe chart indicates that Germany imports higher-value waste compared to Bulgaria in ferrous metals, \n\npaper and cardboard, textiles and plastic, whereas Bulgaria imports higher value material in non\nferrous metals. Glass waste imports appear to have a similar value in the two countries.  \n\n \n\nAnother useful metric to look at is how much waste these MS export to other EU countries against the \n\nwaste they generate in order to give an idea of the scale of export needs in comparison to capacity to \n\nmanage wastes domestically \u2013 the smaller the proportion exported the more domestic capacity to treat \n\nthe waste concerned is likely to exist.

This hints at a more independent waste \n\nmanagement system in Bulgaria, which is able to cope with a larger share of its waste without resorting \n\nto shipping it to third countries. \n\n \n\n3.4 Summary of key messages  \n\n3.4.1 Movements by weight \n\nIt is apparent that transboundary shipments remain a small percentage of total waste generated, \n\nindicating that, in general, 98% of wastes generated are treated within the Member States themselves, \n\nwith transboundary movements representing a small percentage by total volume. \n\n \n\nThe nature of the countries plays an important role in their exports of imports of waste. Countries such \n\nas BE, NL and LU are generally transport hub countries, LU as a result of its location amongst a number \n\nof large Member States and BE and NL as a result of the rail and port infrastructure in those countries \n\nthat undertake a considerable share of transboundary shipments of waste both within the EU and \n\nbetween the EU and third countries. This is likely to account for their proportionally higher levels of \n\nexports of wastes than countries of a similar size in terms of population and economy. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of the patterns in the waste streams considered key to the circular economy, as they are the \n\nmost resource rich (i.e. recyclable) revealed the following:  \n\n\u2022 Plastic waste: Some Member States (FR, DE and SE) consistently relying on exports whilst \n\nothers appear to be expanding their imports (most notably CZ, and RO); \n\n\u2022 Glass waste: Some Member States (BE, HU, EL, HU, NL, RO, SE and SI) consistently relying on \n\nexports, whilst others appear either to be expanding their imports of glass waste overall (most \n\nnotably CZ) or are large destinations for glass waste overall (DE and PT); \n\n\u2022 Textile waste: Some Member States (AT, BE, DE, FI, FR, PT and SE) consistently relying on \n\nexports, whilst others are generally net importers of textiles waste (most notably BG, ES, HU, \n\nIT, LT, NL, PL and RO); \n\n\u2022 Non-ferrous metals: When considering the significant volume of shipments originating from or \n\nentering DE, the balance of imports versus exports is relatively small. DK, FR and NL are the \n\nlargest Member States by volume that export more non-ferrous metal waste than they import, \n\nwhereas the likes of AT, ES and IT show increasing trends of net volumes imported increasing \n\nover time; \n\n\u2022 Ferrous metals: IT, BE, ES and LU appear to be the overall countries of destination for ferrous \n\nmetal wastes from other EU Member States. DE, FR and FR appear to rely more heavily on \n\nexports to other Member States of their ferrous metal wastes. Imports into Italy are reported \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/env_wasgen/default/table?lang=en\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n42 \n\n(industry interview) as being relatively high due to the high use of electric arc furnaces in iron \n\nand steel production in Italy, and these are capable of using a much higher proportion of waste \n\nmaterial than blast furnaces (which are more common in German steel making plants). \n\nGermany appears to have the largest number of shipments by waste moving into and out of the \n\ncountry. Germany accounted for over 40M tonnes of crude steel in 2019 (25% of crude steel \n\nproduction in the EU). With net exports of just under 3.5M tonnes, exports of ferrous metal \n\nwaste represent just under 10% of total production. When compared with FR, that accounts for \n\n14.5M tonnes of crude steel production in 2019, net exports as a percentage of production in \n\nFR are 30% of total production. A similar proportion to FR in found in CZ; \n\n\u2022 Paper and cardboard: AT, DE, ES, HU and NL appear to be the overall countries of destination \n\nfor paper and cardboard wastes from other EU Member States.  CZ, DK, FR and PL appear to \n\nrely more heavily on exports to other Member States of their paper and cardboard wastes; \n\n\u2022 Refuse derived fuel, other wastes from mechanical treatment and mixed municipal waste \n\nfor energy recovery and incineration: DE and SE are net importers of these wastes for R1 and \n\nD10 activities but that the proportions imported are a small fraction of the total wastes \n\nsubject to these activities. However, for SK, imports are an important fraction of the total \n\nfeedstocks for R1 and D10 capacity. Conversely, IE and to a lesser extent SI are heavily reliant \n\non exports for the incineration of their wastes. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Values of EU shipments between MSs \n\nThe COMEXT database reports waste shipments both by value and quantity. Therefore, by combining \n\nthe two it is possible to deduce the value per weight of the waste shipments by individual waste code \n\nor broader waste category. It is important to note that there are several possible reasons behind some \n\nMSs presenting very high values for certain waste categories and we have not been able to fully \n\ninvestigate these in this study. For example, one reason for these outliers may be that a MS only \n\nimports waste belonging to a specific high-value waste code, whereas other MSs are more focussed on \n\nlow-value waste or a combination of the two.  \n\n \n\nThis data can also be analysed to compare the relative performance of Member States in the types and \n\nvalue of waste they export and import. To illustrate this the data for Germany and Bulgaria were \n\ncompared. This comparison indicates that Germany imports higher-value waste compared to Bulgaria in \n\nferrous metals, paper and cardboard, textiles and plastic, whereas Bulgaria imports higher value \n\nmaterial in non-ferrous metals. Glass waste imports appear to have a similar value in the two countries. \n\nThe analysis also shows that the ratio between waste exported and generated tends to be much higher \n\nin Germany compared to Bulgaria. This suggests a more independent waste management system in \n\nBulgaria, which is able to cope with a larger share of its waste without resorting to shipping it to third \n\ncountries. \n\n \n  \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n43 \n\n3.5 Final treatment \n\nData on the actual treatments at the point of destination are not always easily identifiable, if they exist \n\nat all. There are two main sets of data that can be interrogated for this, each with their benefits and \n\nshortcomings, including in relation to understanding final treatments applied: \n\n\u2022 Comext data provides a lot of detailed and reliable data on flows of materials and their \n\nreported values. However, it does not include data on final treatment. Certain assumptions are \n\nmade in relation to some CN code material identified as recyclable raw materials by waste \n\n(i.e. that it is assumed that it always crosses borders for recovery given its inherent value). \n\nWhilst this may, in general, be correct, it is almost certain that at least a fraction of the \n\nmaterials transferred across borders are not recycled or reused but may be recovered in \n\nenergy from waste facilities or disposed of (i.e. sorting residues); \n\n\u2022 Eurostat waste shipment data generally contains a significant amount of information on the \n\nwaste treatments applied to the wastes shipped. However, the dataset is far less \n\nencompassing of recyclable raw materials by waste because not all such wastes are subject to \n\nnotification and reporting under the relevant waste statistics Regulation. \n\n \n\nThe following three step approach was followed in order to assess the nature of the treatment provided \n\nto waste that is shipped between Member States: \n\n\u2022 Identification and selection of important (high volume) waste streams transported between EU \n\nMSs; \n\n\u2022 Analysis of the flows of identified high volume waste types between EU MS;  \n\n\u2022 Analysis of the treatments provided by EU MS to the intra EU transferred waste volumes. \n\n \n\nIn the first step, the Comext data delivered in section 3.2, on waste that is traded as goods under \n\nparticular CN codes, is complemented by waste trade data reported in accordance with the Basel \n\nConvention and the Waste Shipment Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of \n\nthe Council (as reported by Eurostat). A particular asset of the latter dataset is that it provides insight \n\non the first treatment step that is given to the waste at destination. The most relevant hazardous and \n\nnon-hazardous waste flows that are reported are identified here. This information on reported waste \n\nflows is then aggregated to the traded waste and end-of-waste streams that are reported in the \n\nCOMEXT database. \n\n \n\nThe Eurostat data that is analysed is: \n\n\u2022 \u201cExport\u201d: waste streams exported from one (reporting) EU member state to another MS; \n\n\u2022 \u201cImport\u201d: waste streams imported from one (reporting) EU member state to another MS; \n\n\u2022 Figures for 2016 and 2017. \n\n \n\nTable C-1 in Annexe C presents 16 different waste flows, characterised according to their Basel codes, \n\nthat are considered most relevant when investigating the volumes are transferred between EU member \n\nstates. It is important to point out that this analysis contains some hazardous wastes. These waste \n\nstreams are beyond the target scope of this report but they have been included in the analysis because \n\nthe data is available, and because there are significant environmental benefits to be derived from \n\nrecovering material from some of these hazardous streams (e.g. those containing metals). \n\n \n\nThe next table (C-2) in Annexe C then shows the volumes of these waste codes that were transferred \n\nbetween MSs in 2016 and 2017. The analyses focus on these 16 waste types, each with annual intra EU \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n44 \n\nshipment volumes of over 100 kilotons. Averages are taken for the two years, in order to account for \n\npossible disruptive events that might have affected particular waste streams in a certain year. As the \n\ndecision to proceed to ship waste is taken by the exporting operators, the data referring to intra-EU \n\nexports (as opposed to imports) is used for the analysis.  \n\n \nFigure 3-35 Illustration of intra-EU cross border waste streams (avg. 2016-2017) as reported under the Basel \nConvention (as export) (Blue = Hazardous; Green = Non-hazardous)  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe figure above shows the order of magnitude of the main intra-EU waste streams which are reported \n\nunder the Basel Convention. The most important categories, in terms of volume, are residues from \n\nindustrial waste disposal operations, wastes collected from households, and residues from the \n\nincineration of household waste, followed by zinc- and lead-containing compounds and asbestos. \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that by far the most voluminous waste stream that is transferred between EU \n\nmember states corresponds to the category \u2018Not specified\u2019, representing between 55 to 61% of the total \n\nreported waste flow. The category of \u2018not specified\u2019 waste also has a total weight that is about 4.5 \n\ntimes higher than the second most relevant waste stream, the already very generic category of \n\n\u2018residues from industrial waste disposal\u2019. This implies that for most of the waste that is reported to the \n\nBasel Convention, the waste properties and characteristics are very generic or completely unknown. \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n45 \n\nAlthough this information gap represents a clear and important limitation for the study of the \n\nenvironmental benefits from intra-EU waste movements, the nature of the reported, expected and \n\nintended treatments still allows for some meaningful analysis. \n\n \n\n3.5.1 Analysis of the flows of identified high volume waste types between EU MS  \n\nThe flows of CN coded waste-related goods have been analysed earlier in this report.

Several member \n\nstates from the group with an intensive exchange of notified waste types, have specialised in the \n\ntreatment of specific waste streams, and account for the treatment of more than half of particular \n\ntypes of notified waste.  \n\n \n\nAn overview for all specialised waste treatment providers is given in table C-3 in Annexe C. It can be \n\nobserved that only three EU countries, namely Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, account for \n\nmore than half of the treatment capacity required for a series of different, notified waste streams. \n\nAdditionally, five other MSs each offer sufficient capacity for treating a major share of the total volume \n\nof a specific waste category transferred from other EU MS. \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n53 \n\n4 Member State measures under WSR Article \n11 and 12 \n\nIn the following section we present examples of measures that Member States have taken under Article \n\n11 and 12 of the WSR, including other measures, to object or restrict waste imports. These measures \n\nare of interest to this study because they could be acting as a barrier to the free movement of \n\nrecoverable resources. An explanation of the legal basis is provided in Annex D.  \n\n \n\nIn the WSR, the EU lays down the principle that waste subject to recovery activities should be able to \n\nmove freely within the EU without any unjustified restrictions imposed by national, regional or local \n\npolicy and legislation. The Regulation also addresses waste movements for the purpose of disposal. The \n\nidea is that waste movements for recovery should be given priority and must be allowed to move to the \n\nfacility where it is best treated to reduce the overall amount of waste disposed. According to the WFD \n\nrecovery is \u2018any operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by replacing \n\nother materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste being \n\nprepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy\u201911. Examples of recovery are \n\npreparation for reuse, recycling or the use of waste as a fuel (incineration with energy recovery). \n\nRecycling is defined as \u2018any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into \n\nproducts, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the \n\nreprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into \n\nmaterials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations\u201912. Disposal, on the contrary, is \n\ndefined as \u2018any operation which is not recovery even where the operation has as a secondary \n\nconsequence the reclamation of substances or energy\u201913. It includes practices like landfilling or \n\npermanent storage14. According to the waste hierarchy, the practices falling under waste disposal are \n\nless desirable than recovery and should be reduced in the long-run. \n\n \n\nIf the EU's waste markets function efficiently, without unjustified restrictions, waste would be routed \n\nto better sorting techniques, optimised processes and more effective treatment and recovery including \n\nrecycling. This would improve the protection of the environment and public health, create more jobs \n\nand increase growth in the EU's waste management and recycling sectors. However, based on Article 11 \n\nand 12 of the WSR and Article 16 of the WFD, Member States can object to imports of waste for \n\nrecovery and/or disposal purposes of waste that require a prior informed notification and consent \n\nprocedure. This only applies to those waste types mentioned in Annexes II and VIII of the Basel \n\nConvention (hazardous waste, mixed municipal waste, residues from incineration of household waste \n\nand unlisted waste).  \n\n \n\n4.1 MS Measures to object or restrict the shipments of waste \n\nThe compilation of measures (table 4-5) and their subsequent analysis are based on outcomes extracted \n\nfrom the Study of Efficient Functioning of Waste Markets in the EU (2016), information reported by the \n\n \n11 European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (2008) Directive 2008/98/EC on waste and repealing \ncertain Directives  \n12 Ibid \n13 Ibid \n14 Ibid \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008L0098&from=EN\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n54 \n\nMember States to the European Commission15 and Basel Convention16, and publicly available \n\ninformation such as political announcements. The Basel Convention parties are required to transmit \n\ntheir national reports to the Secretariat which includes providing information on transboundary \n\nmovement of waste as well as restriction measures of waste shipments of hazardous and other wastes17. \n\nInformation reported to the European Commission is collected through comprehensive implementation \n\nquestionnaires of the WSR. These include, inter-alia, objections to planned shipments for disposal and \n\nrecovery or measures taken to generally or partially prohibit the shipments of waste between Member \n\nStates18. \n\n \n\nAlmost all Member States (23/27) have reported measures that restrict the disposal or recovery of \n\nimported waste from other EU Member States. Countries that have not communicated within the last 20 \n\nyears any objections towards the import of waste and its treatment are Ireland, Italy, and Luxembourg. \n\nGreece last reported restrictions in 2011, but has eased them in the meantime. Comparing the number \n\nof restriction measures for disposal and recovery, the data suggests that most restrictions are imposed \n\non the disposal of imported waste from other EU MS than on the recovery of waste.

The \n\nspecific types of waste that Member States restrict or prevent the import of for disposal are asbestos \n\nwaste (such as asbestos cement), hazardous waste, mixed municipal waste, sewage sludge and \n\nincineration residues from MSW (RDF). The table below (Table 4-4) shows which waste types are \n\naddressed through measures to object to waste imports and those Member States that put the \n\nrespective measure in place.

Currently, two \n\ncountries have such a tax in place: the Netherlands and Sweden (Table 4-6). These taxes apply \n\nirrespective of whether the waste is domestically generated or imported19,20. The Netherlands imposed \n\nthis tax on the incineration of domestically produced waste in 2015. In 2020, it was extended to waste \n\nimports, specifically targeting RDF waste which represents a quarter of all waste incinerated in the \n\nNetherlands21. The government aims to eliminate RDF imports in just three years as the tax (32\u20ac/tonne) \n\nraises the total cost of waste incineration in the country above other countries. This could suggest the \n\naim of creating a level playing field for imported vs. domestic wastes. Denmark has also pursued similar \n\nmeans of discouraging imports of RDF for energy recovery22. \n\n \nTable 4-4 Fiscal measures of Member States to restrict the import of waste for recovery \n\nActivity Country Fiscal measures Source \n\nRestricting the \n\nrecovery of \n\nimported waste \n\nNetherlands \nImposition of waste incineration \n\ntax of 32\u20ac per tonne on imports \n\nEUWID (2020) Danish ministers call for \n\ncuts to waste imports \n\nSweden \n\nImposition of waste incineration \n\ntax of 7\u20ac per tonne irrespective \n\nof whether the waste is \n\ndomestic or imported  \n\nEUWID (2020) Danish ministers call for \n\ncuts to waste imports \n\nAvfallsverige (2020) Skatt p\u00e5 \n\nf\u00f6rbr\u00e4nning redan 2020 \n\nSource: Own table \n\n \n\n4.2 Analysis of the measures to restrict the import of waste for disposal or \n\nrecovery \n\nIn order to analyse the significance of the measures imposed to restrict the import of waste for disposal \n\nand recovery with the absolute intra-EU waste flows we have initially focussed on those countries that \n\nimport 70% of the total waste volume imported (to pick up the most significant volumes). However, \n\nsince the largest importers rarely have restriction measures in place, we also analysed those countries \n\nthat are known (from the previous section) to have import restrictions. For this analysis, we have \n\nassessed the data to look for trends that suggest an influence from the import restrictions. For \n\nexample, if the restrictions are influential, one would expect a lower volume of imports to countries \n\nthat have restrictions in comparison to a country which does not have these restrictions. As the waste \n\nstreams which are more frequently restricted are not captured in the intra-EU waste flow model (based \n\non COMEXT), this analysis was conducted with Eurostat waste shipment data23. Owing to the high level \n\n(i.e. multiple waste stream coverage) of many restrictions, the total import data for all recovery \n\noperations and disposal operations (respectively) was analysed. However, for certain cases, specific \n\nwaste operation codes were analysed (i.e. for energy recovery imports: R1). Furthermore, certain \n\nspecific waste flows (RDF, Sewage Sludge, and MSW) were disaggregated to better analyse measures \n\nfocused on specific wastes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n19 Avfallsverige (2019) Skatt p\u00e5 f\u00f6rbr\u00e4nning redan 2020 \n20 Belastingdienst (2021) Tables of environmental tax rates \n21 Taylor, I.

According to Eurostat (WShipR) data, the total imports for waste for disposal to \n\nthe Netherlands did not see significant reductions in imports between 2014 (507 ktonnes) and 2015 (420 \n\nktonnes). The figures for 2016 even increased to 446 ktonnes, only to finally decrease to 153 ktonnes in \n\n2017.  It is unclear if these trends are related to restrictions. However, a possible reason could be that \n\nthe ban in the Netherlands is based on the self-sufficiency principle (WFD). This would allow waste \n\nimports for disposal if capacity was not fully utilised with domestic waste and if the waste was \n\nprocessed in accordance with the minimum standards set in the national waste plan based on the waste \n\nhierarchy24. \n\n \n\nThe Member States which export the most waste for disposal purposes into the Netherlands are \n\nGermany, Belgium and, to a lesser extent, France. Since 2014, the tonnage of waste imports from \n\nBelgium and France has fluctuated, with only Germany seeing continuous (and gradual) reductions \n\nbetween 2014 and 2017 (from 214 to 53 ktonnes, respectively).  \n\n \n\nThe Netherlands has one of Europe\u2019s largest ports (Port of Rotterdam). This needs to be considered as \n\nan influence on the level of waste imports for disposal because the Netherlands could be a transit \n\ncountry for waste to be shipped from other EU countries for shipment outside of the EU (extra-EU \n\nshipments). However, the Netherlands shows no data on waste exports for disposal to extra-EU \n\ncountries between 2014-2018. This fits with the WSR regulation which prohibits the export of wastes for \n\ndisposal, except for some EFTA exceptions (WSR, Article 34). Furthermore, they import relatively little \n\nwaste from extra-EU countries (from 116 ktonnes in 2013, to 4 ktonnes in 2018).  \n\n \n\nThe Netherlands was a net-exporter of waste for disposal between 2013 and 2017. In 2013, they \n\nexported 585 ktonnes more than they imported, a balance which reduced in subsequent years to a net \n\nexport of waste for disposal of 206 ktonnes in 2017. This could explain the increased imports of waste, \n\nwhich may be in transit to other European countries. The Netherlands exports mostly to Germany (67% \n\nof exports between 2013-2017), Belgium, and, to a lesser extent, Denmark and France. \n\n \n\nIn regard to imports of RDF waste for disposal purposes, the data is relatively uninformative. Only \n\nGermany has data which is randomly scattered in spikes across the years (2010, 2011, 2014 and 2016), \n\nand the rest of the time they do not report any imports. This is most likely owing to RDF\u2019s use as a fuel \n\nin energy recovery processes. Therefore, more data is available for the recovery imports (see below). \n\n \n24 According to the email conversation in 2021 with Ytzen Lont, Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water \nManagement. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n62 \n\nHowever, the one important insight is that Germany is the only country from the four that has no \n\nrestrictions on waste for disposal and is the only country with imports of RDF for disposal. France is the \n\nonly outlier, which does not ban waste shipments of RDF for disposal, but nonetheless has no imports. It \n\nremains unclear why this is the case.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Analysis of the largest importers of waste \u2015 recovery \n\nThe countries importing 70% of the waste shipped for recovery across the EU between 2013-2018 are \n\nthe Germany, Netherlands, France, and Sweden. \n\n \nTable 4-6: MSs responsible for the largest volume of waste for disposal (2013\u20132018)   \n\nMember State Total imports [tonnes] Percentage of total EU imports \n\nGermany 29 608 992 25% \n\nNetherlands 22 221 515 19% \n\nFrance 20 762 390 18% \n\nSweden 13 744 976 12% \n\nSource: Calculations are based on Eurostat \n\n \n\nGermany has no measures to restrict imports of waste for recovery. France has some restrictions on the \n\nimport of sewage sludge (and related) wastes. However, these restrictions were only imposed in 2020 \n\nso it is not yet possible to track their impact using the 2013-2018 data. The Netherlands has a flexible \n\nimport limit on waste for recovery, since 2015. The restriction is only applied if the national capacity \n\nfor waste recovery is depleted (i.e. waste-to-energy), and as a consequence Dutch waste has to be \n\nlandfilled. The set limit is very high, and therefore this restriction is rarely applied25. The only country \n\nwith a (partial) restriction on importing waste for recovery purposes within the timeframe is Sweden. \n\nSince 2011, Sweden has had a restriction on the import of hazardous wastes for recovery. A further \n\npartial restriction is placed on amber-listed wastes, if there is no capacity for recovery in Sweden.   \n\n \n\nThe amount of waste imported into the Netherlands has steadily increased between 2013 and 2017, \n\nfrom 2.9 Mt to 5.4 Mt (no data available for 2018). A large majority of this was imported for R1 (2.1 Mt; \n\n51%) and R5 (2.7 Mt; 51%) recovery processes. Imports for both recovery types follow the broader \n\nimport trends (a steady increase from 2013-2017). For R1 energy recovery, this appears counter \n\nintuitive because the only restriction by the Dutch authorities is the flexible limit26 on R1 waste imports \n\n(since 2015). However, the increase of imports is possible as this flexible limit is so high that it is rarely \n\napplied. It has only been applied once when the largest Dutch waste-to-energy plants was out of order \n\n(during the summer of 2019)27. The countries they import most waste for recovery purposes from \n\ninclude Belgium, Germany and, to a lesser extent, France. \n\n \n\nSweden\u2019s import rates of wastes for recovery have been relatively stable (with minor fluctuations) \n\nbetween 2013 and 2018, with a low of 2 Mt in 2013 and a peak of 2.4 Mt in 2014 with an average import \n\nrate of 2.3 Mt per year. R1 recovery made up more than 90% of all imports for recovery in all years from \n\n2013-2018 (96% between 2016-2018). Sweden\u2019s largest imports for wastes destined for recovery come \n\nfrom the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, and Denmark (intra-EU). Sweden imports most of its wastes \n\nfrom Norway and the United Kingdom (extra-EU). This is understandable owing to Norway\u2019s close \n\nproximity, and the UK\u2019s dependence on exporting wastes that would otherwise be landfilled. Sweden\u2019s \n\n \n25 According to the email conversation with Ytzen Lont, Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management on \nthe 05/01/21. \n26 The flexible target may not have actually tried to limit R1 recovery, but to meet climate targets (owing to popular \ndemand). However, it was made so large to still allow R1 import while meeting climate targets. \n27 According to an email conversation in 2021. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n63 \n\ndependence on imports to run its energy-from waste facilities, is a likely justification for this stabilised \n\nimport across the years. \n\n  \n\nFrance and Germany are the only countries considered in this analysis of the top four largest importers \n\nof waste with no restrictions on the import of wastes for recovery within the timeframe considered \n\n(2013-2018). France has seen a relative increase in the amount of waste imported, from 2.3 M in 2013 \n\nto 4.5 Mt in 2018. However, this figure has fluctuated slightly from year to years. Germany has seen a \n\nsimilar relative increase, from 4.3 Mt in 2013 to 5.0 Mt in 2018. As with France, the imports fluctuated \n\nduring the period, with a high of 5.2 Mt imported in 2015. France\u2019s imports mostly arrive from \n\nLuxembourg, Germany, and to a lesser extent Belgium and the Netherlands. However, just under 50% of \n\nall imports arrive from extra-EU countries. Germany received most of its imports from the Netherlands, \n\nwith a smaller amount of imports arriving from a broad range of other countries (Austria, Belgium, \n\nDenmark, France, Italy and Luxembourg). This is very likely to be linked to the central location of \n\nGermany in Europe. \n\n \n\nWhen viewing the levels of imports of RDF waste for recovery purposes, Germany and the Netherlands \n\nare two of the largest importers of such waste. For Germany, they imported 533 kt in 2013, which \n\nincreased to 1 025 kt in 2015 dropping to 661 kt in 2018. The Netherlands consistently grew from 1.0 Mt \n\nto 1.7 Mt between 2013-2016 and then decreased to 1.5 Mt in 2017 (no data exists for 2018). Sweden \n\nhad a large increase in imports of RDF between 2013 (421 kt) and 2015 (721 kt). From 2015-2018, the \n\nimports have fluctuated an average of 748 kt per year. This was largely imported from the UK (>70% \n\nfrom 2015-2018). Much of this relates to Sweden\u2019s reliance on imports for R1 recovery, as previously \n\nnoted. It is unclear why exactly France has a low import quantity of RDF, as none of the four countries \n\nhad import restrictions (or taxes) within the timeframe 2013 to 2020.   \n\n \n\nBased on the preceding analysis which was impeded by data limitations, no clear links between the \n\npresence and use of Article 12 restrictions on importing of wastes intended for recovery, and \n\nimport rates could be identified. For instance, the Netherlands has Article 12 restrictions in place but \n\nstill imports waste for recovery, and these volumes appear large relative to its size (i.e. compared to \n\nFrance). Germany, imports the largest amounts of waste for recovery. This is likely to be related to its \n\nlarge size, treatment capacity and centrality in Europe rather than its lack of Article 12 restrictions.  \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Analysis of all Member States with import restrictions (Article 12, WSR) \u2015 disposal \n\nAnother approach to analysing the importance of the Article 11 and 12 measures is to identify those \n\ncountries which have limited the most waste flows through these measures, i.e. it can be postulated \n\nthat the MSs with the most measures under Article 11 and 12 related to restricting the import of all \n\nwaste, including the import of hazardous, MSW and RDF for disposal and recovery purposes, could see a \n\nrelatively lower volume of waste imports28. \n\n \n\nAccording to Table 4-4, countries that restrict the import of waste for disposal are Belgium (Wallonia), \n\nBulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, \n\nSlovakia, Slovenia. The majority of these countries have little to no imports of waste for disposal during \n\nthe time period, except Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland. Belgium\u2019s imports relate to the fact \n\nthat the ban was only in place for one region of the country (Wallonia \u2015 and not in Flanders or \n\nBrussels). For the Netherlands, a likely reason is the fact that the country is a net-exporter of waste for \n\n \n28 More recent strict measures (e.g. banning all waste for disposal purposes) cannot be considered as the waste \nmodel data only covers until 2019. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n64 \n\ndisposal (as mentioned above). This could suggest that the Netherlands is a transit country where waste \n\nis imported and later shipped on elsewhere to which restriction according to Article 11 and 12 do not \n\napply. However, no link has been made to the \u201cRotterdam effect\u201d (i.e. related to large shipment \n\nquantities from Rotterdam port to/from extra-EU countries). In the case of Poland, which is a net\nimporter of waste for disposal (by a large margin), the import ban for all waste destined for disposal \n\nhas only been imposed in 2018, which is the last year of our period of analysis. Prior to this date the \n\nimport ban was only related to specific waste streams (which could not be further identified). \n\nTherefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions.  \n\n \n\nThe import of hazardous waste, MSW and RDF is banned by Croatia and Lithuania. When viewing the \n\nEurostat (WShipR) data, it becomes clear that both countries imported little to no hazardous, MSW, or \n\nRDF wastes for disposal. Lithuania only imported waste for disposal in 2014 and 2015, however, this was \n\nan insignificant quantity (150 tonnes total over both years). In both cases, these were imports of soils \n\nand stones (containing hazardous substances)29 from Latvia for D8 biological treatment. Lithuania is a \n\nlarge net-exporter for waste for disposal by 1 557 tonnes across the two years (2014-2015). Therefore, \n\nit is possible that this waste is transiting through Lithuania towards central Europe. When looking \n\nbeyond countries with restrictions, the only country with imports of RDF for disposal is Germany.  \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Analysis of all Member States with import restrictions (Article 12, WSR) \u2015 recovery \n\nCountries that established measures to restrict imports of all waste and for recovery purposes within \n\nthe timeframe 2013-2018 are Austria, Bulgaria, Slovenia, France, Poland, and Czechia. These are \n\nmostly focused on MSW, RDF and hazardous waste (however, different Member States have different \n\nmeasures). Bulgaria, Poland and Czechia are the only countries that ban all wastes for recovery (unless \n\ngreen-listed, for the latter two). The Netherlands, Latvia, Sweden, and Belgium have partial \n\nrestrictions based on domestic waste recovery capacity.  \n\n \n\nBulgaria, Poland, and Czechia have restrictions in place for all wastes for recovery purposes (except \n\ngreen-listed waste for Poland and Czechia). Poland\u2019s imports of waste for recovery increased from 65 \n\nktonnes in 2013 to 406 ktonnes in 2018. At the same time, it is notable that Poland increased its \n\nrecycling capacity between 2012-2018 from 961 to 3,095 recycling facilities30. This is a likely reason to \n\njustify this increase. Bulgaria has low levels of imports of waste for recovery purposes, which has \n\nfluctuated over the years. From 2015\u20132018, there is a notable increase in imports of 61 ktonnes to 114 \n\nktonnes. This may be linked to the conditional ban on all wastes for recovery. Czechia shows large \n\nincreases in imports from 243 ktonnes in 2013 to 505 ktonnes in 2018. Most of this waste is non\nhazardous, and likely green-listed waste (which is not included in Czechia\u2019s ban).     \n\n \n\nThe three countries banning the imports of MSW for recovery purposes are Austria, Slovenia, and \n\nLithuania. Austria only banned the import of MSW in 2018, therefore data is not yet available to reflect \n\nany impacts of this ban. For Slovenia, the only import in this period was a quantity of 38 tonnes in \n\n2015, from Croatia. In the same year, Slovenia exported 539 tonnes of MSW. For Lithuania, there are \n\nonly occasional imports made across the years from a variety of Member States. Within the period of \n\n2013-2018, only Denmark, Latvia and Sweden sent MSW to Lithuania. The largest shipment was 924 \n\ntonnes of discarded electronic equipment with hazardous substances from Denmark in 2014. The years \n\n2015 and 2016 showed no imports to Lithuania. Lithuania is not generally a net-exporter of MSW, \n\ntherefore, it is unclear how certain imports are possible.  \n\n \n29 European List of Wastes code: 17 05 03. \n30 Eurostat: env_wasfac. Available here.  \n\nhttp://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wasfac&lang=en\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n65 \n\n \n\nOnly Lithuania has a ban on imports of RDF for recovery purposes, during the timeframe 2013-2018. \n\nFrance introduced a ban in 2020 and Hungary plan to introduce one in the future. Eurostat (WShipR) \n\ndata shows that Lithuania does not import any RDF waste for recovery purposes. Beyond countries with \n\nrestrictions: the Eurostat data highlights that almost all countries import RDF for energy recovery to \n\nvarious degrees. The only countries that do not are Italy, Lithuania, Malta and Romania. It is therefore \n\nclear that Lithuania\u2019s restrictions are effective. Malta\u2019s lack of imports will be related to the fact that \n\nit has no energy recovery facilities (based on Eurostat env_wasfac data31). This, however, does not \n\nexplain Italy or Romania\u2019s lack of imports, as both countries have a significant number of energy \n\nrecovery facilities \u2013 but they appear to meet their demand domestically. \n\n \n\n4.3 Summary of key messages \n\nEurostat (WShipR) data was used instead of the intra-EU waste flow model (based on COMEXT) to \n\ncompare with restrictive measures by Member State. This was due to the fact that waste types in the \n\nmodel do not match the waste types of the MS measures, whereas Eurostat data reports all waste \n\ntypes. \n\n \n\nThe dominant countries in the EU importing waste for disposal or recovery purposes are Germany, the \n\nNetherlands, France, and Sweden. They have very little to no restrictions on waste imports, which \n\nmatches with the high trend of imports these countries have within the time period analysed (2013\n2018). The first three countries import waste either from each other or from Italy, Luxembourg, \n\nAustria. Sweden received more waste from extra-EU countries (Norway and United Kingdom). Other \n\nreasons for these countries (except Sweden) receiving higher imports could be their location as central \n\nEuropean countries and their close proximity to other Member States, their treatment capacities, or \n\ntheir economic stability (and size). For Sweden, imports were almost all related to energy recovery \n\npractices (R1), and therefore suggest that Swedish imports are a necessity to fill the capacity of \n\nSwedish energy recovery plants. \n\n \n\nIt was assumed that countries with large ports, e.g. the Netherlands and Rotterdam, may have received \n\nlarger import shares as a transit waste to be shipped to extra-EU countries. According to our analysis, \n\nfor disposal this is not the case, with little to no exports of waste for disposal to extra-EU countries. \n\nThis is in-line with the WSR regulation. \n\n \n\nThe level of effectiveness of waste import restrictions in accordance with Article 11 and 12, WSR, is \n\ndifficult to confirm. The largest waste flows for disposal or recovery purposes occur between large and \n\ncentrally located countries which have no, or only partial restricting measures in place. The import \n\nrates of smaller countries changed only slightly or showed no correlation, following the reported \n\nimplementation of new restriction measures. This lack of apparent impact could relate to data \n\nlimitations (the broad scope of Eurostat data and time period limitations), or smaller treatment and \n\nimport levels. Therefore, no clear conclusion on the effectiveness of waste import restriction measures \n\ncan be drawn. \n\n \n\nWith regard to RDF, it is possible that restrictions have led to reduced imports in Member States. \n\nGermany is the only MS reported by Eurostat (WShipR) to be importing RDF for disposal, and is one of \n\nthe few that has no restrictions. For RDF for energy recovery, only Lithuania has a measure in place to \n\n \n31 Eurostat env_wasfac.

It is important to \n\nstress that they should not be thought of as independent from each other as, in some cases, they \n\ninterrelate and have a causal relationship: \n\n1. Economic; \n\n2. Regulatory; \n\n3. Technical; \n\n4. Geographic; \n\n5. Environmental. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of the drivers behind intra-EU waste movements is different for hazardous and non\nhazardous waste. Non-hazardous waste is the primary focus of this work (as this typically contains more \n\nrecyclable resources), but some of the issues apply to both hazardous and non-hazardous waste \n\nstreams.  \n\n \n\nhttps://www.suezwatertechnologies.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAgc-ABhA7EiwAjev-jw1V2SDyRKFDnktCt66nzDz3ZOEOD4irnOnJWcDl_fR5lJpsRjTToBoC-4cQAvD_BwE\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n68 \n\nNon-hazardous waste, such as metals, plastic, paper or glass, can be traded between EU MS without any \n\nprior notification procedure or any restrictions imposed by the MS for recovery purposes. However, \n\nwhere waste is shipped with the intention of disposal, the waste shipment needs notification.  \n\n \n\nBefore presenting the different drivers, it is important to point out that they cannot simply be ranked, \n\nalthough economic drivers always appear to be the most important, and there is clear interplay \n\nbetween the drivers. We have attempted to summarise and capture the influential factors and different \n\nconsiderations that waste holders face in the decision-tree in the figure below. \n\n \nFigure 5-1 Decision-tree for intra-Eu waste shipments \n\n \nSource: own table \n\n \nBox 5-1 Explanation decision matrix \n\nThe decision matrix for any specific waste is specific to it and influenced by legal, operational and economic \n\nconsiderations. Therefore, it should be stressed that this decisions tree is only intended to illustrate the drivers, \n\nand how they interact with each other, and it cannot capture every option for every waste stream. \n\n \n\nThe very first thought facing a waste holder is if they wish to comply with the law or not. If not, the decision will \n\nbe to pursue the cheapest option, with environmental considerations playing no role. \n\n \n\nAssuming the waste holder wishes to comply with the law (which will apply to all the waste captured in the \n\nstatistics), the first question is if the waste is green-, or amber-listed, or if it can actually be defined as a \n\nresource according to \u2018end of waste\u2019 definitions. In the case of green-listed waste, a suitable recovery facility has \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n69 \n\nto be found, either within the country of origin or outside. If the facility is located in another MS, it also has to be \n\nchecked if the respective MS imposes any restrictions on the import of the waste in question. Once options are \n\nclear, factors, such as transports costs and value of the resource, will determine where the waste will finally go \n\nfor recovery.  \n\n \n\nIn order to reduce administrative costs for shipments which require notification an important consideration is \n\nwhether the facility is pre-consented. This would make future shipments significantly faster as consents last for 3 \n\nyears not one. Consenting multiple shipments as opposed to each individual shipment is another cost saving \n\napproach waste holders pursue. \n\n \n\nThe next consideration cluster relates to practical and operational factors (orange) which decide on the transport \n\nmode and method for the shipment. Thereafter, the economic considerations (yellow) relate to treatment costs \n\n(gate fees and taxes). Depending on the waste type, the decision arrives at options representing either the \n\nminimisation of costs (for disposal) or maximising revenue through recovery. \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Economic drivers \n\nEconomic drivers include issues related to minimising the costs of treatment and transport. These \n\ninclude gate fees or taxes for sending waste to incineration plants or landfills, the cost and efficiency \n\nof transport as well as the market price for secondary materials.  \n\n \n\nLandfill tax is a well known example of how the cost / price of waste disposal influences the disposal \n\nand recovery options that waste prodcuers / holders select, including wether or not to ship waste \n\nbetween MSs. To show a link between landfil taxes and the volumes of waste imported for disposal, we \n\nhave attempted to correlate data on waste shipments and landfill taxes using Eurostat data on \n\nshipments of waste (hazardous and non-hazardous) intended for disposal32. Importantly, Eurostat data \n\nshows the total shipment for all disposal types and not specifically landfilling. However, the figures \n\nshold be indicative of landfilling trends in MSs. Even if minimal or no correlation can be seen with \n\nlandfill taxation data, it could show that such taxes are not a significant driver on EU waste shipments. \n\nThe waste shipment data indicates that such taxes have a limited impact on total imports for waste \n\nbeing disposed of in relevant MSs. For example, in Portugal there was a tax levied in 2007, but there is \n\nno indication of an impact on waste shipments in 2010-2012, however from 2013-2018 waste shipments \n\nfor disposals increased greatly. The full list of landfill taxes can be found in Annex E. \n\n \n\nThe data for the Netherlands demonstrates a correlation between landfill taxes and increased/ \n\ndecreased waste imports intended for disposal. During the years when the tax was suspended (2012\n2015) there was a marked increase in imports for disposal of 100 000 to nearly 200 000 tonnes per year \n\n(not including 2013, which can be viewed as an outlier year). In 2016, the first year of reintroducing a \n\nlandfill tax, there were similar high levels of imports. However, 2017 showed a reduction of nearly 50% \n\nin waste imports for disposal. Eurostat data on imports for disposal in Sweden also show some \n\ncorrelations with landfill taxes. In 2015, following the increase of the tax to 500 SEK (50\u20ac) per tonne, \n\nthere was a decrease in imports of waste for disposal. Figures from 2015\u20132018 fluctuated but their \n\naverage remained 50% lower per year compared with the 2014 figure.  \n\n \n\n \n32 Eurostat env_wasship. See here.  \n\nhttp://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wastrd&lang=en\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n70 \n\nA related aspect that was raised by waste industry stakehodlers during our interviews is that the cost or \n\nvalue of final treatment also influences the decision of intermediates, i.e. waste brokers or traders. \n\nEven though the waste was originally notified (if applicable) and shipped as waste to be recycled, waste \n\nbrokers might still decide against recycling if market prices decrease far enough to make the value of \n\nthe resource lower than the transport cost. However, there is no method to hold intermeditate \n\n\u2018brokers\u2019 responsible for where the waste they broker is going. \n\n \n\nAnother relevant economic driver is the cost of transport which is highly dependent on the mode of \n\ntransport and the distance. According to the EEA, road transport accounts for more than 50% of all \n\nfreight transport within the EU, followed by maritime and inland waterways, and railway Figure 5-2). \n\nThis distribution of modes appears broadly applicable to waste. According to our interviews with waste \n\nstakeholders, most of them already consider truck and ship (if infrastructure allows) as their preffered \n\nshipment mode. This is due to the flexibility that transport by truck offers and the low price for water \n\nshipments33. As would be expected the closest disposal or treatment facility is preferred as it implies \n\nthe lowest transport costs. The distance that waste can be economically shipped depends on its value \n\nper tonne/shipment. For example for organic waste that will be converted to compost, it is not \n\neconomically viable to transport it more than 40 km34. However, for waste lead acid batteries the value \n\nper tonne is much higher, so the economic radius for transport to a recyling facility is more that 10 \n\ntimes higher at 5-600 km. The same logic applies in regard to where the production of the \u2018new\u2019 \n\nproduct will happen \u2015 this should ideally be as close as possible to the recycling facility35. \n\n \nFigure 5-2 Freight transport volume and modal split within the EU \n\n \nSource: EEA (2019) Freight transport volume and mdel split within the EU  \n\n \n\nTo give an indication of the cost per distance and mode Figure 5-3 shows the average transportation \n\ncosts for densified feedstock (grains) shipped by different transport means within the USA.

The \n\nanalysis shows that if shipping is not an option, trucks are the lowest cost option up to a certain \n\ndistance (here, up to 161 km). For longer distances, trains are most cost-efficient. However, when the \n\nvolume shipped is too small to justify the use of a unit train, then a truck is the best alternative for \n\ntransportation distances up to 282 km. For longer distances, single rail car shipments are the most \n\neconomical choice. However, if maritime and inland water transport are viable alternatives and the \n\nquantity shipped is larger than 1 400 tonnes, this is always the most economical option.36 \n\n \nFigure 5-3 Transportation costs for densified feedstock by transport means and distance \n\n \nSource: Gonzales, D. et al. (2012) Cost analysis for high-volume and long-haul transportation of densified feedstock \n\n \n\nFor recycable waste the commodidy price plays a key role. This is directly influenced by the balance \n\nbetween market offer (supply) and its demand. For most recylable commodities, there is a European \n\nmarket, such as for Wood or alternative fuels, but also a global one, e.g. for paper and metals37. As an \n\nexample, for lead (coming from end of life vehicle batteris), there is a clear added value on the market \n\nthrough a consistent demand for the recycled material (making new vehicel batteries). However, for \n\nother streams that can be recycled, there is less of a clear and obvioud market, or it is highly variable, \n\nwith occasions of no value. This requires recyclers to vary the price they offer in line with market price \n\ndevelopment (e.g. for metals, the London Metal Exchange is accessed)38. For some materials, e.g. \n\nplastics, the prices for sorted or recycled material can go very low. This can result in the lowest cost \n\ndisposla route for it being to put it into solid recovered fuel (SRF) or RDF waste to boost the calorific \n\nvalue and make it more attractive to incinerators or industrial users. This does not represent a good \n\noutcome and wastes the years of effort spent in changing conumers\u2019 behavious to encourage them to \n\nseparate out their plastic waste, as well as investment ins the plant to sort and reprocess it39. \n\n \n36 Gonzales, D. et al.

In theory, high gate fees or landfill taxes should provide an incentive for waste holders to find \n\nalternative solutions, such as separating and preparing the waste for recycling. However, cross\nchecking this hypothesis with Eurostat data, this seems not to be the case in practice. For the transport \n\ncosts, which do play a strong role, the most common means to ship waste from its country of origin to \n\nthe receiving country are truck or ship. If infrastructure allows (presence of connecting river, canal or \n\nsea), ships are the preferred option as they are cheaper per tonne of waste transported than trucks. \n\nRegarding the market price for secondary materials, which clearly relates to the Circular Economy, it \n\ncan be concluded that increasing prices for recycled materials are a key factor in mobilising recycling \n\nindustries to expand their capacities. \n\n \n\n5.1.2 Regulatory drivers \n\nRegulatory drivers primarily derive from the administrative requirements of compliance with \n\nlegislation (WSR) and related to the cross-border transport of waste as well as the lack of \n\nharmonisation in the application of the legislative framework.  \n\n \n\nThe WSR demands a notification for waste destinated for all disposal operations, and certain recovery \n\nactivities, which causes administrative barriers and costs for waste operators. These are reinforced \n\nthrough frequent delays on parts of the responsible authority40. However, waste operators still have to \n\ndeal with their waste and recovery facility operators require inputs of waste to operate, so these \n\nburdens are overcome, with the typical response being to start consent application procedures earlier if \n\na delay is expected. All of the waste stakeholders interviewed confirmed that they try to find and use \n\npre-consented facilities (consents that last for 3 years instead of 1 year) and prefer general notification \n\nagreements (covering multiple shipments as opposed to single shipments) while they also start the \n\nnotification process as early as possible41. \n\n \n\nBeyond the WSR, several directives42 require MSs to recycle and/or reuse a minimum percentage of \n\ncertain waste types. Also of relevance is the European target under the WFD of 50% preparation for \n\nreuse and recycling for MSW to be reached by 2020. Despite being reached for the EU as a whole in \n\n2018, the Commission announced that 14 MSs are at risk of missing the 2020 target43. Barriers to reach \n\nthese targets include a lack of collection and recycling infrastructures, and relevant industrial \n\nproduction facilities. \n\n \n\nThe lack of harmonisation is especially strong in the application of the restriction measures on waste \n\nimports for disposal or recovery, in accordance with Article 11 and 12 under the WSR (further discussed \n\nin Annex D) and the different standards in each MS as well as definition of e.g. end-of-waste (EoW) \n\ncriteria (an extensive analysis can be found in the WSR evaluation report44 and the study on efficient \n\n \n40 European Commission (2016) The efficient functioning of waste markets in the EU \n41 For instance, according to the interview with Campine on the 03/02/2021. \n42 For instance, the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (EU, 1994), the Directive on End-of-life Figure 4.1 \nExports of waste plastics and selected waste metals from EU Member States, 1999\u20132011 Vehicles (EU, 2000) and the \nDirective on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EU, 2002 and 2012), as well as the recycling targets for \nhousehold waste and construction and demolition waste in the revised Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008). \n43 European Commission (2018) Early warning for Member States at risk of missing the 2020 target of 50% preparation \nfor re-use/recycling for municipal waste \n44 European Commission (2020) SWD Evaluation of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/framework/early_warning.htm\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n73 \n\nfunctioning of the EU waste markets45). For example, in Germany EoW criteria for recovered paper are \n\nreported as only existing in the state of North-Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria. Therefore, it would be \n\neasier to ship the paper waste from the Netherlands to Indonesia, than to Bavaria where it would \n\nchange its status four times from waste to non-waste46. The interpretations of what is green-, orange- \n\nand green-listed waste also vary by MS. The differences in green listing of waste typically relate to \n\ndifferent contamination and impurity levels deciding if a shipment is green listed or not. This causes \n\npractical difficulties as green-listed waste shipments do not have to be notified and can be shipped \n\nimmediately while orange-listed waste has to be notified and has to await consent. Examples of this \n\ncausing problems have been reported at the Danish-German border regarding mixed plastic waste, \n\nwhich is green-listed in Denmark, but orange-listed in Germany. Such misalignment causes delays or \n\neven stops the shipment of recyclable materials, which hinders the Circular Economy. During the \n\ncurrent health crisis, these effects are reinforced through more border controls with higher standards in \n\nterms of safety and hygiene for waste that has been in contact with people, such as packaging waste. \n\nThis causes additional costs which is putting major financial pressure on many waste- and EPR \n\ncompanies.47 \n\n \n\nTwo other regulatory factors of interest are illegal shipments and price signals through taxes. Illegal \n\nshipments remain a key issue of waste shipments, as exemplified by the frequency of commodities \n\nseized by Operation DEMETER IV48 and by increased illegal plastic shipments outlined by Interpol.49 \n\nHowever when analysing regulatory drivers only legal operations are focused on. The price signals \n\ndelivered via taxes could also be considered regulatory drivers but are covered under economic drivers. \n\n \n\nSummary of key messages \n\nThe most common administrative burden associated with regulation is the notification for all shipments \n\nfor disposal purposes and some shipments for recovery activities. The lack of harmonisation in the \n\napplication of the WSR relate to Article 11 and 12 and unaligned standards and definitions present in \n\nMSs. However, these do not typically block shipments. Its typical impact is to increase waiting times \n\nand costs of shipments that ultimately decreases profit margins and / or slows resource movement.  \n\n \n\n5.1.3 Technical drivers  \n\nThe main technical driver influencing intra-EU waste movements relates to the presence or not of \n\nsufficient infrastructure to deal with all waste treatment and recycling needs within a country\u2019s \n\nboundary.  \n\n \n\nA recent report of relevance is \u201cStudy on investment needs in the waste sector and on the financing of \n\nmunicipal waste management in MS50\u201d. This includes a review of the plastic and textile recyclate \n\nprocessing capacity in Europe. It also includes information on costs for some other waste streams (ELV \n\nplastic, WEE plastic, CMD plastic, etc.) but assumes that there would be no extra processing costs for \n\npaper and card, metal, and glass. The report estimates that Europe requires an extra 2.7 million tonnes \n\nof plastic reprocessing capacity to deal with municipal plastic waste currently exported from Europe. \n\nThey estimate a cost of \u20ac750/tonne/yr \u2015 for this capacity based on the costs reported for three \n\n \n45 European Commission (2016) The efficient functioning of waste markets in the European Union  \n46 According to the interview with EuRIC on the 27/01/21. \n47 According to the interview with MWE on the 10/02/2021. \n48 IMPEL (2018) \u201cIMPEL supports WCO operation on illegal waste trafficking\u201d.

On other exported wastes that could be recycled (glass metal, paper, card) the report \n\nstates that there is no more processing capacity needed as existing capacity is sufficient. \n\n \n\nThe data gathered on additional capacity and capital investment requirements across the different MSs \n\nfor the 2021-2027 period highlights that the MSs most in need of further recycling re-processor \n\ninfrastructure (particularly for MSW, non-MSW plastics, and textiles wastes) include France, Italy, \n\nGermany, Poland and Spain (Table D-1 and Annex D, Figure D-2). \n\n \nTable 5-1 Additional capacity requirements and investment requirements (2020-2027) \n\nMember State Additional capacity requirements (thousand \n\ntonnes) \n\nCapital investment requirements (\u20ac \n\nmillion) \n\nFrance 2 220 1 678 \n\nItaly 1 146 805 \n\nGermany 976 683 \n\nPoland 930 677 \n\nSpain 845 591 \n\nSource: Eunomia and COWI (2019)51 \nNote: This factors in MSW, non-MSW plastic packaging, and textile wastes. \n\n \n\nThe model data (as shown in Task 2) provides a comparison of how the infrastructure needs may effect \n\nwaste flows. All the countries from the Eunomia/COWI study were generally net exporters of many of \n\nthe non-hazardous wastes52. In 2019, France (13.9 Mt), Germany (4.1 Mt) and Poland (3.2 Mt) were all \n\nnet exporters of these wastes. Italy and Spain were both net importers of all waste types in the same \n\nyear owing to their large imports of ferrous metals (Spain, 5.8 Mt, Italy, 9.7 Mt), and paper for Spain \n\n(2.0 Mt). \n\n \n\nFrance, Italy and Germany all show net-export trends for both plastics and textiles in the years 2016 to \n\n2019. Nevertheless, the waste quantities are far less than that for other secondary materials, such as \n\npaper and pulp or different metals. In 2019, the net exports for plastics were: 0.37 Mt for France, 0.065 \n\nMt for Italy, and 0.7 Mt for Germany. For textiles, net exports in the same period the figures were: 0.39 \n\nMt for France, 0.073 for Italy, and 0.6 for Germany. None of these countries show exclusively exports of \n\nthese wastes. For France, imports made up a smaller share of total imports/exports for textiles (17\u2013\n\n20%) and plastics (23\u201331%). For Germany, the import share was slightly greater for textiles (23\u201328%) and \n\nplastics (35\u201336%). While for Italy, the import share made up a greater percentage for textiles (40-48%) \n\nand plastics (44\u201347%). In other words, total imports in 2019 for textiles (0.1 Mt for France, 0.16 for \n\nItaly, 0.28 for Germany) and plastics (0.29 Mt for France, 0.25 Mt for Italy, 0.84 Mt for Germany) is not \n\nan insignificant amount. This does not completely reflect the hypothesis that these countries require \n\nadditional recycling capacity, but would ensure that they become larger exporters of non-hazardous \n\nwastes (in regard to plastic and textiles).  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, in Spain and Poland there is no clear trends of net exports, with the data on plastics and \n\ntextiles fluctuating between the respective country being a net exporter and net importer between \n\n2016 and 2019. Imports represent a significant share of total imports and exports for both countries and \n\nboth waste streams (45\u201366%). \n\n \n51 Eunomia and COWI (2019) \u201cStudy on investment needs in the waste sector and on the financing of municipal waste \nmanagement in Member States\u201d.

Germany, Italy, and France are net exporters of \n\nwastes that they have been identified as being the EU countries requiring most additional recycling \n\ncapacities. However, they also import significant amounts of these wastes, which seems improbable in \n\ncountries with a lack of recycling capacity. It seems logical that a lack of technical recycling capacity \n\nwould be a key driver, however, further data is required to confirm this assumption and it may be that \n\nthe data is not sufficient defined (within streams) to pick up supply and capacity mismatches. If there \n\nwas more detailed data on recycling capacity per MS, by waste type, this data could be reassessed more \n\naccurately. \n\n \n\nIncineration capacity also represents a relevant driver for moving waste across the EU. The previous \n\nanalysis implies that overall, the EU faces recycling capacity constraints which is also confirmed \n\nthrough the interviews held with several waste stakeholders53. In terms of incineration capacity, the \n\ncase is different: while the capacities by country within the EU range from no capacity to overcapacity, \n\noverall it appears that the EU has enough incineration capacity to deal with its waste generated54 \u2015 \n\nwith a tendency to further increase.  \n\n \n\nThe article \u2018Europe\u2019s waste incineration capacities in a circular economy\u2019, assesses the incineration \n\ncapacity of waste-to-energy plants (R1 treatment) treating municipal solid waste (Y18 and 46). It, \n\nthereby, excludes RDF. The total number of incineration plants covered under the scope of the study is \n\n372 with a capacity of 62 733 128 tonnes in 2011. The full table listing the incineration capacity for \n\neach MS, can be found in Annex D, Table D-4. \n\n \n\nIn some countries, large waste-to-energy plants are common, while in other countries smaller plants \n\nare more common. Germany and France have the largest capacities for MSW incineration. Although \n\nGermany has a higher capacity than France, France has a higher number of plants (125). \n\n \n\nDenmark has the highest per capita incineration capacity with over 550 kg per capita. This is followed \n\nby the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden with per capita capacities of 300\u2013550 kg. The remaining \n\ncountries are in the middle range or have small capacities of less than 100 kg per capita \u2015 some \n\ncountries had no MSW incineration capacity at all in 2011. \n\n \n\nOverall, most of the countries have an incineration capacity of less than a quarter of their generated \n\nMSW, which could indicate either high recycling rates or large parts of the waste being landfilled55. \n\nSome of these countries use mechanical\u2013biological treatment plants as an alternative route to treating \n\nmixed MSW. However, these countries could also be exporting waste to countries with larger capacities. \n\nIn cases of high capacities compared with generated MSW, the risk of competing with recycling needs to \n\nbe considered. \n\n \n\nWhen assessing over- and under capacities a deeper analysis of the waste import and export figures is \n\nuseful as it gives an idea of how much of the capacity is used with imports and how much waste is \n\nexported in relation to the country\u2019s capacity. In general, imports and exports of municipal waste for \n\nincineration can give an indication of regional over- and under capacities. \n\n \n53 For instance with CEWEP on the 29.01.21. \n54 Wilts, H. and von Gries, H.

Except \n\nfor Italy, no MSW from extra-EU countries has been imported. Italy imported between 7 841 and 9 590 \n\ntonnes for R1 purposes over the period of 2016-2018. Belgium, Luxembourg and Sweden require \n\nsignificant amounts of imports in order to keep their incineration capacities at sufficient utilisation \n\nrates. Of these countries, only Sweden imports from an extra-EU country, i.e. 17 796 in average per \n\nyear between 2013-2018 from Norway (25% of its total waste imports). For Germany, imports of MSW \n\nfor incineration are higher than the export. After 2011 until 2018, this trend remains, however, \n\nGermany\u2019s MSW imports multiplied by 15 (from 31 048 to 476 277 tonnes). Of these imports, only 2% \n\nhave originated from extra-EU countries (between 2013-2018). \n\n \n\nThe imports or exports of MSW for R1 purposes only refer to a limited number of countries \u2015 almost no \n\nEastern European EEA members or southern European countries are included. It becomes clear that in \n\nSweden (with regard to imports), waste incineration capacities have, despite its waste incineration tax \n\nbeing in place since 2006, a high level of importance for the waste incineration market. Another related \n\nobservation is that the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany both import and export MSW. \n\n \n\nThis analysis shows the enormous differences between the different member states. In 2011, it ranged \n\nfrom 0-<550 kg per capita of incineration capacity. In four of the 27 MS, the incineration capacities \n\nexceed 50% of the annual waste generation (Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden), while in two \n\nof them the total amount of annually generated municipal waste is not enough to fill all the \n\nincineration plants (Croatia and Estonia). These capacities might be used to incinerate waste from non\nmunicipal sources or imports. Though there remain uncertainties regarding the calculation of \n\ncapacities, it is clear that they exceed the amount of MSW generated. \n\n \n\nThe overall incineration overcapacity, together with the lacking recycling capacity, implies a potential \n\ntrade-off between filling incineration capacities and achieving the 2020 50% recycling target of the \n\nWFD, as well as the objectives of the EU\u2019s Environmental Action Programme to move towards a circular \n\neconomy, to limit energy recovery to non-recyclable material and to reduce the generation of waste. \n\nNevertheless, additional investments in waste incineration capacity might be useful to divert additional \n\nwaste streams from landfilling. Regardless of this, interviewed waste stakeholders stress that especially \n\nfor the waste streams plastic, paper and steel, Europe needs to create a new domestic market for \n\nrecycled materials which would divert extra-EU shipments and create more balanced supply and \n\ndemand dynamics as well as reduce the vulnerability to global market price volatilities. \n\n \n\nThe following five suggestions / issues were raised as useful for supporting and developing the EU \n\nrecycling market: \n\n\u2022 A mapping of recycling facilities as well as pre-consented facilities would significantly \n\nfacilitate current and future increased intra-EU recycling efforts56; \n\n\u2022 There should be an inspection and verification system in place ensuring that waste really goes \n\nto recycling \u2015 waste shipments must be transparent and notifiable. This could go hand in hand \n\nwith an online verification system (Electronic data interchange);57 \n\n\u2022 The aim should not be to have recycling plants for every waste stream in every country. The \n\nEU is one economic area which should manage the issue in a broader picture. This could be an \n\n \n \n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n77 \n\nopportunity to unlock the potential of economically-weaker countries by making them centres \n\nof excellence in recovering certain waste streams for the EU;58 \n\n\u2022 Considering the fact that there is some spare Energy from waste capacity in Western and \n\nNorthern Europe while capacity is missing in Southern and Eastern countries, it is crucial to \n\nestablish a flow that brings waste from the East to the North in order to avoid landfilling in the \n\nSouth and East of Europe.59 \n\n \n\nUnder the pressure of the European target to only landfill a maximum of 10% by 2035 of each MS\u2019s \n\nwaste combined with the lack of knowledge, many public waste authorities take the decision to build \n\nan incineration plant. This decision is taken because it is seen as a relatively fast and easy solution (in \n\ncomparison to the efforts required to develop a system to separately collect and treat the recyclable \n\nstreams. This approach is potentially hampering the European recycling target. Hence, decisions of \n\nwaste authorities could be better supported through more effective incentives as well as capacity \n\nbuilding and technical advice.60 \n\n \nBox 5-2 Diverse opinions related to RDF waste in the EU \n\nDuring our interviews with European waste companies and operators, we received a diverse range of opinions on \n\nRDF waste. These are summarised below: \n\n1. RDF is produced from commercial, industrial and household waste and is then used as a fuel for \n\nincineration in e.g. power generation facilities or cement kilns. However, in practice this seems a \n\nmisnomer as a significant part of RDF is burnt in energy from waste (EfW) plants. This is mainly due to \n\ntwo factors. First, the restricted number and capacity of cement kilns (And other industrial facilities \n\nthat can use RDF) cause market demand limitations. Second, the potentially corrosive content in some \n\nRDF (e.g. chlorine in plastic) might cause damage to the combustion equipment in some industries \n\nmaking it less attractive for use as a fuel. \n\n2. The production of RDF was originally pursued as a means to reduce the volume and moisture content of \n\nmixed waste to makes its transport cheaper and to reduce the landfilling volumes (and costs). Its \n\ncontinued existence is driven by this objective (meeting landfill diversion targets) and not by meeting \n\nany fuel need. This continued existence could be seen as a barrier to recycling, as it provides too \u2018easy\u2019 \n\nof route for waste disposal.  \n\n3. Cement kilns require a high calorific value which pure RDF supplies. However, as it becomes more \n\ncommon to burn RDF in EfW plants, the level of carbon-neutral content \u2015driven by biogenic content \u2015 \n\nand calorific value are emerging topics (typically offered in low, medium and high levels). The demand \n\nis increasing for more carbon-neutral content as it enables higher capacities for WtE plants and implies \n\na lower carbon tax on the electricity produced from burning the waste. This is achieved by mixing RDF \n\nwith waste wood61.  \n\n4. Considering the points raised above there appears a case for better defining standards for RDF. \n\nApplying EoW classification to RDF or even classifying it as green-listed, raises the risk of bypassing \n\ncurrent waste legislation as these classifications do not need notification. It is, therefore, arguably \n\nbetter to regulate it in a harmonised way on the European level. Germany, the Netherlands and France \n\nalready have standards for calorific value and the absence of contaminants in RDF. However, even with \n\nstandards for RDF there can be market distortions, e.g. Portugal tried to produce RDF from their \n\nmechanical biological treatment plants, but could not compete on price with RDF being imported from \n\nthe UK.62 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n61 According to the interview with EuRIC on the 27/01/2021. \n62 According to the interviews with MWE on the 10/02/2021 and CEWEP 29/01/2021. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n78 \n\nSummary of key messages \n\nIt is clear that a MS, when lacking capacity to treat or recycle a particular waste, will export to a \n\ncountry which has an overcapacity. Several waste flows can be linked to imbalances between waste \n\ntreatment capacity and waste generation. For example, Sweden imports high volumes of waste for \n\nincineration as it has an overcapacity. Overcapacity also has a clear impact on waste treatment prices \n\nIn the case of incineration, it results in lower national treatment costs and reduced gate fees. \n\n \n\n5.1.4 Geographic drivers \n\nGeographic drivers relate to two main factors. First, the size of the country from which the waste \n\nderives (with bigger countries more likely to have more treatment and disposal capacity). Second, the \n\ngeographic location which determines access to infrastructure and proximity to neighbouring \n\ncountries and their facilities. \n\n \n\nAs explained in section 3.5, the majority of the waste shipped for disposal and recovery happens \n\nbetween 8 countries which are adjacently located. This confirms that proximity as well as trust-worthy \n\ntrade partnerships also have a moderate influence on the decision where to treat the waste. \n\n \n\nThe remaining aspects falling under this driver closely relate to transport costs and technical drivers \n\n(capacity). These factors are also of relevance to peripheral and island countries, as these (by \n\ndefinition) face larger distances and costs to access the capacity in continental Europe.  \n\n \n\n5.1.5 Environmental drivers \n\nEnvironmental drivers relate to the choice of transport means and the final disposal or treatment \n\noperation which is influenced by legislation or individual conviction.  \n\n \n\nThe primary environmental driver is arguably compliance with environmental legislation that aims to \n\nsupport the superior long-term goal GHG emission reduction target of 60% by 2050 \u2015in 2017, the \n\ntransport sectors was responsible for 27% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU63. \n\nComparing the emissions released by the most commonly utilised transport means (truck, train and \n\nship), it becomes clear that the trend correlates with the transport costs for long distances (Figure 5-4). \n\nLorries between 7.5-24 tonnes of cargo capacity emit the most emissions, with lower emissions for \n\nhigher loads. Diesel trains rank next while the electric version emit the least emissions. However, it \n\nshould be noted that electric railways are less interesting for heavy cargo shipments. The container ship \n\nperforms as second best in terms of contributing to CO2-equivalent emissions. \n\n \n  \n\n \n63 EEA (2019) Greenhouse gas emissions from transport in Europe \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/transport-emissions-of-greenhouse-gases-7/assessment\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n79 \n\nFigure 5-4 Average CO2 emissions by freight transport means \n\n \nSource: own figure, based on data provided by European Association for forwarding, transport, logistics and \ncustoms services (2015) Calculating GHG emissions for freight forwarding and logistics services in accordance with \nEN 16258 \nNote *: average emissions are calculated as a mean of values from average, volume and bulk goods. \n \n\nBeyond CO2 emissions, freight transport activities also cause other externalities which are not \n\nrepresented in their respective transport costs, such as noise pollution or habitat damage. The \n\nEuropean Commission study \u2018Sustainable Transport Infrastructure Charging and Internalisation of \n\nTransport Externalities\u2019 concludes that railways should be given a stronger role in European transport, \n\ninter-alia because of its lowest contribution to climate change and air pollution.64 \n\n \nFigure 5-5 Externalities by transport means \n\n \nSource: CER (2019) Commission study results suggest greater role for European railways \n \n\nThere are also drivers related to the minimising of emissions from waste disposal and treatment \n\ntechniques.

Most of them would like and/or already plan to give it a larger role, \n\nhowever, the environmental considerations only come out top when they match the economics (e.g. \n\nminimising transport costs typically minimises emissions, and getting paid for a recoverable resource is \n\nbetter than paying a gate fee and tax for disposal).  \n\n \n\nSummary of key messages \n\nThe main reasons to take environmental considerations into account are the compliance with \n\nenvironmental legislation, that aims to reduce GHG emissions, and the transport and treatment costs, \n\nas these correlate with the environmental impact (transport means with high CO2 emissions, come at a \n\nhigher cost). This confirms how important economics, regulation and market incentives are for driving \n\nthe single market in the EU towards more environmentally-friendly decisions67. \n \n\nAs mentioned in the beginning of this section, the main drivers presented influencing the decision\nmaking about how and where to treat the waste, cannot be ranked throughout different waste flows. \n\nHowever, within our literature review and interviews with various waste stakeholders, it became clear \n\nthat the total price (composed of disposal/treatment costs, transport costs and/or value of resource, \n\nin case of recovery) plays a primary role in the decision of where to ship the waste and what to do \n\nwith it. For the other drivers no general conclusion can be made. \n \n\n \n66 Cremiato, R. et al.

Although \n\nthe focus of this report is on non-hazardous (recyclable) waste, in order to maximise the use of the \n\navailable data, and to gain maximum insight we have considered some hazardous waste streams \n\n(reported under the Eurostat/ Basel / WSR data) in this analysis. It should be pointed out that recovery \n\nof resource from these hazardous streams is possible and offers large steps up the waste hierarchy (and \n\nhence environmental benefits). Moreover, for the assessment of environmental benefits in a Circular \n\nEconomy, the administrative status of waste (hazardous/non-hazardous/) or waste-related materials is \n\nof very little relevance. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the Comext data, this analysis builds on the assumption that CN-coded waste streams, \n\nwhich are traded as goods, will typically be recycled in view of their material content. Unfortunately, it \n\nis not possible to ascertain destinations (recovery technologies) for all CN-coded waste flows, as \n\nalready explained earlier in this report. There is also a lack of public information available on the yields \n\nand efficiencies of the particular recycling processes that are used, and on the corresponding volumes \n\nof secondary waste (residues) that is generated that in turn has to be treated or disposed of.  \n\n \n\nTherefore, the different types of primary treatments are categorised according to their position on the \n\nwaste hierarchy. The waste hierarchy has been accepted as a guiding principle in the Waste Framework \n\nDirective, for reducing the environmental impact of waste and to promote resource efficiency through \n\nreuse, recycling and recovery. The positioning on the waste hierarchy, of a waste treatment that is \n\ngiven to a particular waste type, allows us to qualitatively derive environmental benefits, since \n\nmaterial recycling is commonly assumed to present higher net benefits than energy recovery, and \n\nenergy recovery is environmentally preferred over disposal. \n\n \n\nThe data and information on exported and imported waste flows obtained for each member state, \n\nincluding both COMEXT and WSR (Eurostat) data, is categorised according to the first treatment on \n\narrival (assuming recycling for CN-coded waste). This allows conclusions to be drawn on the \n\nenvironmental benefits that are generated by moving waste from one member state to another. \n\n \n\nHowever, the magnitude of the environmental benefits as a consequence of waste treatment does not \n\nonly depend on the type of treatment that is provided, but also varies according to: \n\n\u2022 The potential environmental burdens that could be inflicted by a particular category of waste; \n\n\u2022 The environmental impacts that are avoided by recycling activities that produce secondary raw \n\nmaterials that can substitute for resource-intensive, primary equivalents. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n82 \n\n \n\nIn order to take account of this an \u201cenvironmental performance level\u201d between 0 and 4 has been \n\nassigned to different waste treatment types as distinguished by the Basel Convention, according to the \n\npotential environmental benefit which could be realised by the treatment (0 = no benefit; 4 = highest \n\nbenefit). For the waste streams which are notified under the Basel Convention, the provided or \n\nintended treatments are documented, and a treatment code is attributed to each notified waste \n\ntransfer. \n\n \n\nThe following environmental performance levels (EPL) have been distinguished for Basel-coded, notified \n\nwastes: \n\n\u2022 EPL 0: Deposit, injection, impoundment, incineration without energy recovery, release, \n\nblending or mixing, storage, and accumulation, are treatments that provide the lowest \n\npossible environmental benefits; \n\n\u2022 EPL 1: Repackaging, biological or physico-chemical treatment, and disposal in specially \n\nengineered landfills, are more or less complex treatments that aim to decrease the \n\nhazardousness of the waste, providing a limited environmental benefit; \n\n\u2022 EPL 2: The use of notified waste as a fuel or means to generate energy, is here categorized as \n\nproviding a medium environmental performance level; \n\n\u2022 EPL 3: The recycling, recovery or reclamation of materials from notified waste is expected to \n\nprovide a high level of environmental performance, since the secondary raw materials that \n\nresult from such treatments, will substitute for primary resources, and thus avoid the \n\nassociated environmental impacts; \n\n\u2022 EPL 4: Oil production, ore extraction and the production of basic metals are all associated \n\nwith considerable environmental impacts. Therefore, the regeneration of waste oil and \n\nrecycling of metals and metal compounds is categorised among the highest performing waste \n\ntreatments. The use of residual materials from waste treatment avoids these secondary wastes \n\nto be disposed of, and returning organic components to the benefit of agriculture, are also \n\nconsidered as complex but highly beneficial treatment option for notified waste. \n\n \n\nA similar approach was applied to the Comext data (for the years 2016 and 2017). For these CN-coded \n\nwaste transfers however, the actual treatment to which the waste will be submitted on arrival is not \n\nexactly known. Therefore, it was necessary to assume the most plausible treatment for a selection of \n\n23 of the most relevant waste-related trade flows. The assignment of treatment codes was supported \n\nby private consultant guidance that provided waste disposal and recovery code-based flowcharts68. The \n\noverview of assumed treatments is provided in Table 6-1. \n\n \n  \n\n \n68 Chart can be found here: https://www.360environmental.co.uk/documents/DRCodeFlowchart.doc  \n\nhttps://www.360environmental.co.uk/documents/DRCodeFlowchart.doc\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n83 \n\nTable 6-1 Assumed treatment options for CN-coded waste transfers \n\nCN NAME   \n\n2303 RESIDUES OF STARCH MANUFACTURE, BEET-PULP, ETC R3 \n\n2308 VEGETABLE WASTE R3 \n\n2620 SLAG, ASH AND RESIDUES CONTAINING METALS R4 \n\n2621 SLAG AND ASH, INCL.

Other countries that import relevant volumes of wastes to be submitted to the \n\nenvironmentally most preferable treatment are Spain, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France. Germany, the \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n85 \n\nNetherlands and Belgium are the top three countries for treating wastes at the second highest \n\nperformance level. \n\n \n\nIt is noted that the performance levels achieved are always the result of the combination of the supply \n\nof a particular waste feedstock and the treatment options that are applicable and (technically and \n\neconomically) available for that waste; and are thus rarely determined by a deliberate and free choice \n\nof the waste trader. In other words, it is impossible to decide to export cotton waste for used oil \n\nrefining. \n\n \nFigure 6-1 Environmental performance levels (EPL), associated with CN-coded intra-EU waste movements, \nrealised in receiving MS \n\n \n\n \n\nAs an illustration to provide further insights, for the Netherlands, the large volume at EPL 2 (4.7 Mt/y) \n\nis explained by: \n\n\u2022 A large volume of imported \u2018Recovered \u2018waste and scrap\u2019 paper or paperboard (excl. paper \n\nwool)\u2019: 2.4 Mt/y \n\n\u2022 Also in this category: \u2018Residues of starch manufacture and similar residues, beet-pulp, bagasse \n\nand other waste of sugar manufacture, brewing or distilling dregs and waste, whether or not in \n\nthe form of pellets\u2019: 838 kt/y; \u2018Acorns, horse-chestnuts, marc and other vegetable materials \n\nand vegetable waste, vegetable residues and by-products of a kind used in animal feeding, \n\nwhether or not in the form of pellets, n.e.s.\u2019: 496 kt/y; \u2018Waste, parings and scrap, of plastics\u2019: \n\n481 kt/y and \u2018Cullet and other waste and scrap of glass; glass in the mass (excl. glass in the \n\nform of powder, granules or flakes)\u2019: 450 kt/y. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-2 shows that those MS that export relevant volumes of CN-coded waste-related goods to other \n\nMS, expect that more of the exported waste will be treated in those options that allow for the highest \n\nenvironmental benefits. This is particularly the case for Germany, France and the Netherlands. These \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n86 \n\nsame countries also export most of the wastes for which the treatments foreseen will probably provide \n\nsomewhat lower environmental benefits. Of all MSs, only Belgium exports more waste to be submitted \n\nto a lower performing treatment as compared to the volume sent to the higher performing treatment. \n\n \nFigure 6-2 Environmental performance levels (EPL), associated with CN-coded intra-EU waste movements, \nprojected by exporting MS \n\n \n\n \n\nAs an illustration, it can be noted that for Belgium, the volume at EPL 2 (2,8 Mt/y) is larger than at EPL \n\n3 (1,7 Mt/y): \n\n\u2022 Mainly due to \u2018Recovered \u2018waste and scrap\u2019 paper or paperboard (excl. paper wool)\u2019: 953 kt/y \n\nand \u2018Residues of starch manufacture and similar residues, beet-pulp, bagasse and other waste \n\nof sugar manufacture, brewing or distilling dregs and waste, whether or not in the form of \n\npellets\u2019: 895 kt; \n\n\u2022 Also: \u2018Cullet and other waste and scrap of glass; glass in the mass (excl. glass in the form of \n\npowder, granules or flakes)\u2019: 592 kt. \n\n \n\n6.3 Environmental performance levels of Basel-coded waste movements \n\nFigure 6-3 shows that imports of Basel-coded wastes are dominated by only three countries: Germany, \n\nthe Netherlands and France. In the Netherlands and in France, the environmentally well-performing \n\ntreatment options related to the recycling, recovery or reclamation of materials dominate the \n\nenvironmental profile. Germany presents a more balanced profile, with volumes of the same order of \n\nmagnitude being recycled (EPL 3), incinerated with energy recovery (EPL 2), or disposed of through \n\ndeposit, injection, impoundment, incineration without energy recovery, release, blending or mixing, \n\nstorage, or accumulation (EPL 0). In Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, relevant volumes (between \n\n0,7 and 1,1 million tons) of the imported notified wastes are disposed of through repackaging, \n\nbiological or physico-chemical treatment, or disposal in specially engineered landfills (EPL 1). Both in \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n87 \n\nGermany and in the Netherlands, more than 1.7 million tons of notified waste are incinerated with \n\nenergy recovery (EPL 2), followed by Sweden with about 1.1 million tons. In Denmark and Portugal, the \n\nlowest performing disposal options dominate the treatment environmental profiles, but in both cases, \n\nthe absolute volumes for each of these countries are below 300 kilotons per year. Also in France, such \n\ndisposal options are relevant in the environmental profile, also in absolute numbers. \n\n \nFigure 6-3 Environmental performance levels (EPL), associated with Basel-coded coded intra-EU waste \nmovements, realised in receiving MS \n\n \n\n \n\nAs an illustration, the following specificities regarding to the effect of particular waste categories \n\n(other than \u2018not specified\u2019 wastes), can be highlighted for some of the receiving MS: \n\n\u2022 Germany: large volumes in categories 0 and 1: \n\no Due to Y36 (Asbestos (dust and fibres)) at EPL 0: 186 kt in 2017, and 198 kt in 2016; \n\no Due to Y46 (Wastes collected from households) at EPL 1: 759 kt in 2017 and 960 kt in \n\n2016. \n\n\u2022 Netherlands: large volumes in categories 2 and 3: \n\no Due to Y18 (Residues arising from industrial waste disposal operations) at EPL 2: 1,3 Mt in \n\n2017 and 1,7 Mt in 2016; \n\no Due to Y18 (Residues arising from industrial waste disposal operations) at EPL 3: 470 kt in \n\n2017 and 591 kt in 2016, and also Y11 (Waste tarry residues arising from refining, \n\ndistillation and any pyrolytic treatment): 265 kt in 2017 and 324 kt in 2016. \n\n\u2022 Sweden: large volumes at EPLs 0 and 1: \n\no Due to Y46: 190 kt in 2017, and 115 kt in 2016 at EPL 0, and 973 kt (2017) and 1,2 Mt \n\n(2016) at EPL 1 (2017). \n\n \n\nFigure 6-4 shows that Basel-coded exports to other EU countries are led by the same group of eight \n\ncountries identified earlier (see section 3.5.1), (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, \n\nLuxembourg, Italy, Austria and Ireland). The resulting environmental profiles of the exporting countries \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n88 \n\nare however diverse: for Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, exports for treatment at the highest \n\nperformance level are relevant in absolute terms (>250 kilotons each); Belgium, Germany and \n\nLuxemburg dominate by far regarding the notified exports intended for material recycling, recovery and \n\nreclamation (EPL 3). The environmental profiles of waste exports from Italy, France, Sweden, Slovenia \n\nand Malta are dominated by the lowest performing option of disposal through deposit, injection, \n\nimpoundment, incineration without energy recovery, release, blending or mixing, storage, or \n\naccumulation (EPL 0). Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany export more relevant volumes of Basel\ncoded wastes for incineration with energy recovery (EPL 2); Irish environmental profile regarding to \n\nnotified waste export volumes is dominated by disposal treatments that consider repackaging, \n\nbiological or physico-chemical treatment, and disposal in specially engineered landfills (EPL 1). \n\n \nFigure 6-4 Environmental performance levels (EPL), associated with Basel-coded intra-EU waste movements, \nprojected by exporting MS \n\n \n\n \n\nAs an illustration, the following specificities regarding to the effect of exports of particular waste \n\ncategories (other than \u2018not specified\u2019 wastes), can be highlighted for some MSs: \n\n\u2022 Germany: high volumes at EPL 0: due to Y46 (Wastes collected from households): 156 kt (2017) \n\nand 159 kt (2016); \n\n\u2022 France: high volumes at EPL 0: due to Y18 (Residues arising from industrial waste disposal \n\noperations): 100 kt in 2016 and 136 kt in 2017; and Y5 (Wastes from the manufacture, \n\nformulation and use of wood preserving chemicals): 46 kt in 2016 and 38 kt in 2017; \n\n\u2022 Ireland: high volumes at EPls 0 and 1: due to \n\no High volumes of Y46 (Wastes collected from households) in category 0 (63 kt (2017); 62 kt \n\n(2016)) and 1 (275 kt in 2017; 274 kt in 2016); \n\no High volumes of Y 47 (Residues arising from the incineration of household wastes) in \n\ncategory 0 (38 kt (2017). \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n89 \n\n\u2022 Italy: high volumes at EPL 0: due to Y18 (Residues arising from industrial waste disposal \n\noperations) (146 kt in 2016; 196 kt in 2017) and Y36 (Asbestos (dust and fibres)) (250 kt in \n\n2016; 219 kt in 2017); \n\n\u2022 Netherlands: high volumes at EPls 0, 1 and 2: \n\no EPLs 0 and 2, this is due to Y18 (Residues arising from industrial waste disposal \n\noperations): 168 kt and 680 kt respectively in 2017, and 211 kt and 617 kt in 2016. \n\no For category 1, this is due to Y46: 475 kt in 2017 and 454 kt in 2016. \n\n\u2022 Sweden: high volumes at EPL 0: \n\no Mainly due to Y9 (Waste oils/water, hydrocarbons/water mixtures, emulsions ): (73 kt in \n\n2016, and 65 kt in 2017). \n\n \n\n6.4 Waste treatment environmental profiles for main waste transferring MS  \n\nIn the following pie-charts, total volumes of (Basel+Comext) waste streams (averages for 2016 and \n\n2017) were analysed in terms of environmental performance level (EPL) for the six most important \n\ncountries (collectively accounting for approximately 70% of the total import or export of these \n\nstreams): Germany, The Netherlands, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria. Pie chart sizes are \n\nproportional to the total transferred waste or waste-related material volumes (aggregated COMEXT + \n\nBasel).  \n\n \n\nBoth for the non-hazardous, CN-coded waste streams traded as goods, and for the notified waste \n\nstreams subject to the Basel Convention, it is clear that the more environmentally beneficial treatment \n\noptions (2-3-4) are favoured over the less beneficial ones (0-1). \n  \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n90 \n\nFigure 6-5 Environmental Performance Levels for main waste importing MS.

Both classifications contain material that could \n\npotentially be recovered and provide environmental benefits. In order to reflect this we have analysed \n\nall significant waste flows \u2013 so using data from Comext and Eurostat. \n\n  \n\nThe physical and chemical characteristics of the waste are of course key for estimating the \n\nenvironmental benefits generated by treating them; e.g. hazardous waste that is treated in order to \n\ncontain or diminish its hazardousness (safe sink benefit) and from which energy and/or materials can be \n\nrecovered (substitution benefit) will be higher ranked in terms of environmental performance than \n\nwaste that is only treated to diminish its hazardousness.  \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n92 \n\n \n\nThe Environmental Performance scale used in this report therefore includes four performance levels, in \n\norder to try and cover all types of intra EU waste shipments for which there is data (both Comext and \n\nEurostat). This scale allows us to assess (i) CN coded non-hazardous waste volumes (Comext), (ii) Basel \n\nnotified non-hazardous waste volumes (Eurostat), and (iii) Basel notified hazardous waste volumes \n\n(Eurostat), together, in order to provide the most complete possible assessment of the environmental \n\nbenefits resulting from intra EU waste movements. This resulted in waste treatment environmental \n\nprofiles for the main waste transferring MS. \n\n \n\nBoth Basel (Eurostat) and CN codes (Comext) data provide valuable details on the type of waste as well \n\nas on the treatment given at destination. The Basel (Eurostat data) is more precise on the treatment \n\nprovided (but less on the waste characteristics, e.g. \u2018not-specified\u2019 is the highest volume waste type), \n\nwhereas COMEXT reveals more detail on the characteristics of the waste and its secondary raw material \n\npotential, but less on the exact treatment at destination. \n\n \n\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that: \n\n\u2022 Volumes of waste traded and documented in the Comext database are much higher than the \n\nvolumes of (hazardous) waste transported with Basel notification; \n\n\u2022 Countries active in transporting hazardous waste are equally active in the trade of non\nhazardous waste and residues; \n\n\u2022 Both for the non-hazardous, CN-coded waste streams traded as goods, and for the notified \n\nwaste streams subject to the Basel Convention, it is clear that the more environmentally \n\nbeneficial treatment options are favoured over the less beneficial ones; \n\n\u2022 The largest volumes usually go to the more beneficial waste treatments. \n\n \n\nThe waste volumes that are treated within the MS are much bigger than the ones that are exported to \n\nother MS. Export will always be more complex and more burdensome as compared to local processing, \n\nso it is a reasonable assumption that waste will not be (legally) exported without having a motive and a \n\ngood reason that makes it a better choice than local treatment.  \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n93 \n\n7 Conclusions \n\nThis section has been structured to answer the three questions presented in the introduction. \n\n1. What can the available data tell us about the intra EU shipments of Waste? \n\n2. What drives and constrains these waste movements? \n\n3. What are the environmental benefits of these waste movements? \n\n \n\n7.1 What can the available data tell us about the intra EU shipments of Waste? \n\nThe table below presents total waste generated, excluding major mineral waste generation, compared \n\nto total waste imports and exports both within the EU and with third countries in millions of tonnes. It \n\nis apparent that transboundary shipments remain a small percentage of total waste generated, \n\nindicating that, in general, over 90% of wastes generated are treated within the Member States \n\nthemselves, with transboundary movements representing a small percentage by total volume. When \n\nmajor mineral wastes are included in waste generation the percentage rises to 98% of wastes generated \n\nbeing treated within Member States themselves. \n\n \nTable 7-1: Total EU waste generation, intra EU and Extra EU waste exports \n\n 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 \n\nTotal EU waste generated (excl. \n\nmajor mineral wastes) \n781 790 760 759 758 770 785 809 \n\nTotal waste exported (extra-EU) 18.6 19.5 24 30 32 28 29 31 \n\nTotal waste imported (intra-EU) 42 44.5 46.4 46.4 46.4 46.4 45.3 49.2 \n\n \n\nThe economy and location of the countries plays an important role in their exports of imports of waste. \n\nCountries such as BE, NL and LU are generally transport hub countries, LU as a result of its location \n\namongst a number of large Member States and BE and NL as a result of the rail and port infrastructure \n\nin those countries that undertake a considerable share of transboundary shipments of waste both within \n\nthe EU and between the EU and third countries. This is likely to account for their proportionally higher \n\nlevels of exports of wastes than countries of a similar size in terms of population and economy. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of the patterns in the waste streams considered key to the circular economy, as they are the \n\nmost resource rich (i.e. recyclable) revealed the following:  \n\n\u2022 Plastic waste:  Some Member States (FR, DE and SE) consistently relying on exports whilst \n\nothers appear to be expanding their imports (most notably CZ, and RO). \n\n\u2022 Glass waste: Some Member States (BE, HU, EL, HU, NL, RO, SE and SI) consistently relying on \n\nexports, whilst others appear either to be expanding their imports of glass waste overall (most \n\nnotably CZ) or are large destinations for glass waste overall (DE and PT). \n\n\u2022 Textile waste: Some Member States (AT, BE, DE, FI, FR, PT and SE) consistently relying on \n\nexports, whilst others are generally net importers of textiles waste (most notably BG, ES, HU, \n\nIT, LT, NL, PL and RO). \n\n\u2022 Non-ferrous metals: There are a significant volume of shipments originating from or entering \n\nDE, and the difference between imports versus exports is relatively small. DK, FR and NL are \n\nthe Member States that export the largest volumes and export more non-ferrous metal waste \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n94 \n\nthan they import, whereas AT, ES and IT show increasing trends of net volumes imported \n\nincreasing over time. \n\n\u2022 Ferrous metals: IT, BE, ES and LU appear to be the overall countries of destination for ferrous \n\nmetal wastes from other EU Member States. DE, FR and NL appear to rely more heavily on \n\nexports to other Member States of their ferrous metal wastes. Imports into Italy are reported \n\n(industry interview) as being relatively high due to the high use of electric arc furnaces in iron \n\nand steel production in Italy, and these are capable of using a much higher proportion of waste \n\nmaterial than blast furnaces (which are more common in German steel making plants). \n\nGermany appears to be the MS with largest volume of ferrous waste moving into and out of the \n\ncountry. This reflects Germany\u2019s position as the largest steel maker in the EU, they accounted \n\nfor over 40M tonnes of crude steel production in 2019 (25% of crude steel production in the \n\nEU). With net exports of just under 3.5M tonnes, exports of ferrous metal waste represent just \n\nunder 10% of total production. When compared with FR (with 14.5M tonnes of crude steel \n\nproduction in 2019), net exports as a percentage of production in FR are 30% of total \n\nproduction. \n\n\u2022 Paper and cardboard: AT, DE, ES, HU and NL appear to be the overall countries of destination \n\nfor paper and cardboard wastes from other EU Member States.  CZ, DK, FR and PL appear to \n\nrely more heavily on exports to other Member States of their paper and cardboard wastes \n\n\u2022 Refuse derived fuel, other wastes from mechanical treatment and mixed municipal waste \n\nfor energy recovery and incineration: DE and SE are net importers of these wastes for R1 and \n\nD10 activities but that the proportions imported are a small fraction of the total wastes \n\nsubject to these activities. However, for SK, imports are an important fraction of the total \n\nfeedstocks for R1 and D10 capacity. Conversely, IE and to a lesser extent SI are heavily reliant \n\non exports for the incineration of their wastes. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the value of Intra EU waste shipments, the COMEXT database reports waste shipments \n\nboth by value and quantity. Therefore, by combining the two it is possible to deduce the value per \n\nweight of the waste shipments by individual waste code or broader waste category. It is important to \n\nnote that there are several possible reasons behind some MSs presenting very high values for certain \n\nwaste categories and we have not been able to fully investigate these in this study. For example, one \n\nreason for these outliers may be that a MS only imports waste belonging to a specific high-value waste \n\ncode, whereas other MSs are more focussed on low-value waste or a combination of the two.  \n\n \n\nThis data can also be analysed to compare the relative performance of Member States in the types and \n\nvalue of waste they export and import. To illustrate this, and to compare two contrasting MSs in terms \n\nof GDP and resource use, the data for Germany and Bulgaria were compared. This comparison indicates \n\nthat Germany imports higher-value waste compared to Bulgaria in ferrous metals, paper and cardboard, \n\ntextiles and plastic, whereas Bulgaria imports higher value material in non-ferrous metals. Glass waste \n\nimports appear to have a similar value in the two countries. The analysis also shows that the ratio \n\nbetween waste exported and generated tends to be much higher in Germany compared to Bulgaria. This \n\nsuggests a more independent waste management system in Bulgaria, which is able to cope with a larger \n\nshare of its waste without resorting to shipping it to third countries. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the treatments that intra-EU waste shipments receives the analysis is constrained by \n\nthe data. The Comext (trade) data does not specify the treatments that the waste receive. The \n\nEurostat (WSR/Basel) data does give some information on waste treatment but does not cover non \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n95 \n\nnotifiable waste shipments and some of the waste classifications it provides lack detail. For example, \n\nthe category \u2018Not specified\u2019, is 55 to 61% of the total reported waste flow.  \n\n \n\nLooking at the Eurostat (WSR/Basel) data \n\n\u2022 Eight member states (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, Italy, Austria \n\nand Ireland) are the main waste exporting countries for the highest volume Basel-coded waste \n\ncategories; \n\n\u2022 Most of the top 10 exporting member states are also listed in the individual member state\u2019s \n\ntop 3 of receiving countries. This shows that the MSs cannot be categorised into receiving and \n\nexporting countries, but rather can be grouped into MSs that transfer high volumes of waste \n\namong each other, and others that are less involved in intra EU waste movements; \n\n\u2022 Cross-border shipments of these flows, which mostly consist of hazardous waste, mainly go to \n\nthe neighbouring countries. \n\n\u2022 Looking at the eight MSs who export most waste, some have also specialised in the treatment \n\nof specific waste streams, and account for the treatment of more than half of particular types \n\nof notified waste. It can be observed that three MSs (Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany), \n\naccount for more than half of the treatment capacity required for a series of different, \n\nnotified waste streams. Five other MSs (Denmark, France, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain) each \n\noffer sufficient capacity for treating a major share of the total volume of a specific waste \n\ncategory transferred from other EU MS \n\n \n\n7.2 What drives and constrains these waste movements? \n\nArticles 11 and 12 of the WSR allow MSs to impose restrictions on the import of certain waste streams \n\nfor disposal or recovery. These measures are of interest to this study because they could be acting as a \n\nbarrier to the free movement of recoverable resources between MSs.  \n\n \n\nThe MSs which import the most waste for disposal or recovery purposes are Germany, the Netherlands, \n\nFrance, and Sweden. They have very little to no restrictions on waste imports, which matches with the \n\nhigh trend of imports these countries have within the time period analysed (2013-2018). The first three \n\ncountries import waste either from each other or from Italy, Luxembourg or Austria. Sweden received \n\nmore waste from extra-EU countries (Norway and United Kingdom). Other reasons for these countries \n\n(except Sweden) receiving higher imports could be their location as central European countries and \n\ntheir close proximity to other Member States, their treatment capacities, or their economic stability \n\n(and size). For Sweden, imports were almost all related to energy recovery practices (R1), and \n\ntherefore suggest that Swedish imports are a necessity to fill the capacity of Swedish energy recovery \n\nplants. \n\n \n\nThe level of effectiveness of waste import restrictions in accordance with Article 11 and 12, WSR, is \n\ndifficult to confirm. The largest waste flows for disposal or recovery purposes occur between large and \n\ncentrally located countries which have no, or only partial restricting measures in place. The import \n\nrates of smaller countries changed only slightly or showed no correlation, following the reported \n\nimplementation of new restriction measures. This lack of apparent impact could relate to data \n\nlimitations (the broad scope of Eurostat data and time period limitations), or smaller treatment and \n\nimport levels. Therefore, no clear conclusion on the effectiveness of waste import restriction measures \n\ncan be drawn. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n96 \n\nWith regard to RDF, it is possible that restrictions have led to reduced imports in Member States. \n\nGermany is the only MS reported by Eurostat (WShipR) to be importing RDF for disposal, and is one of \n\nthe few that has no restrictions. For RDF for energy recovery, only Lithuania has a measure in place to \n\nban its import and Lithuania was one of few countries with no RDF imports for energy recovery \n\npurposes.  \n\n \n\nThe literature suggests that drivers for shipping waste can be categorised into the following, five \n\ngroups.: \n\n\u2022 Economic: Include issues related to minimising the costs of treatment or disposal and \n\ntransport. These include gate fees or taxes for sending waste to incineration plants. The cost \n\nand efficiency of transport also plays a key role -as it does for the transport of any material. \n\n\u2022 Regulatory; It is important to clarify that the administrative burden associated with regulation \n\ndoes not typically block shipments. Its typical impact is to increase waiting times and costs of \n\nshipments that ultimately decreases profit margins and / or slows resource movement. \n\n\u2022 Technical; Mainly relating to the presence or not of sufficient infrastructure to deal with all \n\nwaste treatment and recycling needs within a country\u2019s boundary.  \n\n\u2022 Geographic: Related to transport costs and infrastructure.  \n\n\u2022 Environmental: Regarded as relatively minor by waste companies and closely related to \n\neconomic and regulatory drivers. \n\n \n\nThese drivers cannot simply be ranked, although economic drivers always appear to be the most \n\nimportant, and there is clear interplay between the drivers. We have attempted to summarise and \n\ncapture the influential factors and different considerations that waste holders face in a decision-tree. \n\nThe decision tree for any specific waste is specific to it and influenced by legal, operational and \n\neconomic considerations. Therefore, it should be stressed that this decisions tree is only intended to \n\nillustrate the drivers, and how they interact with each other, and it cannot capture every option for \n\nevery waste stream. \n\n \n\nThe first option facing a waste holder is if they wish to comply with the law or not. If not, the decision \n\nwill be to pursue the cheapest option, with environmental considerations playing no role. \n\n \n\nAssuming the waste holder wishes to comply with the law (which will apply to all the waste captured in \n\nthe statistics), the first question is if the waste is green-, orange- or red-listed, or if it can actually be \n\ndefined as a resource according to \u2018end of waste\u2019 definitions. In the case of green-listed waste, a \n\nsuitable recovery facility has to be found, either within the country of origin or outside. If the facility is \n\nlocated in another MS, it also has to be checked if the respective MS imposes any restrictions on the \n\nimport of the waste in question. Once options are clear, factors, such as transports costs and value of \n\nthe resource, will determine where the waste will finally go for recovery.  \n\n \n\nIn order to reduce administrative costs for shipments which require notification an important \n\nconsideration is whether the facility is pre-consented. This would make future shipments significantly \n\nfaster as consents last for 3 years not one. Consenting multiple shipments as opposed to each individual \n\nshipment is another cost saving approach waste holders pursue. \n\n \n\nThe next consideration cluster relates to practical and operational factors (orange) which decide on the \n\ntransport mode and method for the shipment. Thereafter, the economic considerations (yellow) relate \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n97 \n\nto treatment costs (gate fees and taxes). Depending on the waste type, the decision arrives at options \n\nrepresenting either the minimisation of costs (for disposal) or maximising revenue through recovery. \n\n \n\nFigure 7-1 Decision-tree for intra-Eu waste shipments \n\n \n\nSource: own table \n\n \n\n7.3 What are the environmental benefits of these waste movements? \n\nIntra EU (and any other) waste movements can be considered to provide environmental and circular \n\neconomy benefits though: \n\n\u2022 Enabling the increased recycling of waste into secondary raw materials that effectively \n\nsubstitutes waste for primary materials, avoiding the resource consumption and associated \n\nenvironmental impacts from primary production,; \n\n\u2022 Providing safe sinks for materials contained in wastes, that could damage human health \n\nand/or the environment, and should be removed from new production loops. \n\n \n\nAttempting to analyse the environmental benefits of intra EU waste movements is constrained by the \n\navailability of data that classifies waste by its trade / product category (Comext) or by its level of \n\npotential hazard (Eurostat (Basel/WSR data)). The Basel (Eurostat data) is more precise on the \n\ntreatment provided, but has less information on the waste characteristics, e.g. \u2018not-specified\u2019 is the \n\nhighest volume waste type. COMEXT data has  more detail on the characteristics of the waste and its \n\nsecondary raw material potential, but less on the exact treatment at destination. Both classifications \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n98 \n\ncontain material that could potentially be recovered and provide environmental benefits. In order to \n\nreflect this we have analysed all significant waste flows \u2013 so using data from Comext and Eurostat.  \n\n \n\nThe physical and chemical characteristics of the waste are key for estimating the environmental \n\nbenefits generated by treating them; e.g. hazardous waste that is treated in order to contain or \n\ndiminish its hazardousness (safe sink benefit) and from which energy and/or materials can be recovered \n\n(substitution benefit) should be higher ranked in terms of environmental performance than waste that \n\nis only treated to diminish its hazardousness. Our Environmental Performance scale therefore includes \n\nfour performance levels, in order to try and cover all types of intra EU waste shipments for which there \n\nis data (both Comext and Eurostat).  \n\n \n\nTotal volumes of (Basel+Comext) waste streams (averages for 2016 and 2017) were analysed in terms of \n\nenvironmental performance level (EPL) for the six MSs which transfer the most waste (collectively \n\naccounting for approximately 70% of the total import or export of these streams): Germany, The \n\nNetherlands, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria. Both for the non-hazardous, CN-coded waste streams \n\ntraded as goods (Comext data), and for the notified waste streams subject to the Basel Convention \n\n(Eurostat data), it is clear that the more environmentally beneficial treatment options are favoured \n\nover the less beneficial ones. \n\n \n\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that: \n\n\u2022 Both for the non-hazardous, CN-coded waste streams traded as goods, and for the notified \n\nwaste streams subject to the Basel Convention, the more environmentally beneficial treatment \n\noptions are favoured over the less beneficial ones; \n\n\u2022 The largest volumes of wastes that are moved between MSs usually go to the more beneficial \n\nwaste treatments; \n\n\u2022 Much larger volumes of waste are treated within MSs than are exported to other MSs.  \n\n\u2022 Volumes of waste traded and documented in the Comext database are much higher than the \n\nvolumes of (hazardous) waste transported with Basel notification; \n\n\u2022 The Countries most active in moving notified wastes are equally active in the trade of non\nhazardous waste and waste-related goods. \n\n \n\nExport will always be more complex and more burdensome as compared to local processing, so it a \n\nreasonable assumption that waste will not be (legally) exported without having a motive that makes it a \n\nmore valuable choice than local treatment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n99 \n\nAnnex A -

Article 11 covers shipments for disposal, Article 12 for \n\nrecovery or recycling. The use in practice of these grounds for objection constitutes part of the playing \n\nfield on which a Member State can develop policy strategies on import and export of waste. In cases of \n\nobjection, the competent authorities of destination must notify the country of dispatch within the \n\nstatutory time period of 30 days following the date of transmission of the acknowledgement in \n\naccordance with Article 8 of the WSR. This is done by indicating the objection in the notification form \n\n(block 25) and sending it back to the country of dispatch. \n\n \n\nExamples of specific reasons for objection are that the shipment would not be in accordance with EU or \n\nnational legislation or that the person shipping the waste has previously been convicted of illegal \n\nshipments, see Article 12 (1)(a-k).

Both are \n\nclosely related and often treated as one. Article 16 of the WFD states how Member States should establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal \n\ninstallations, in order to enable the Community as a whole to become self-sufficient in waste disposal, and in the recovery of mixed municipal waste collected from \n\nprivate households (see further Article 3(5) of the WSR). Member States should move towards that aim individually, taking into account geographical circumstances \n\nor the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste. \n\n \n\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the WSR, Member States may, in order to protect their own network of waste disposal installations and or installations for the \n\nrecovery of mixed municipal waste collected from private households (including where such collection also covers waste from other producers), limit incoming \n\nshipments of waste destined to incinerators that are classified as recovery. The condition for doing so is establishing that such shipments would result in national \n\nwaste having to be disposed of or waste having to be treated in a way that is not consistent with their waste management plans at Community or national level. The \n\nsituation is different for waste shipments for recovery or recycling. For such shipments (other than in the specific case mentioned above of mixed municipal waste), \n\nMember States may not make any objections by referring to the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency \u2015 only in well justified exceptional cases this is still an \n\noption. \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n117 \n\nNon-harmonised applications of the proximity and self-sufficiency \n\nprinciples \n\nThe WSR and the WFD aim to strengthen intra-EU waste management and promote operations at the \n\nhigher levels of the waste treatment hierarchy, while allowing flexibility for individual national \n\ncircumstances and conditions through Article 11 and 12 of the WSR as well as through Article 16 of the \n\nWFD. However, the interpretation and application of these articles are not harmonised between \n\nMember States, and there is a perception that this may be causing distortions, delays or even the use of \n\ntreatments lower down the waste hierarchy69. For example, the proximity principle can be abused to \n\nprohibit shipments of waste to other Member States or regions where the waste can be recycled. \n\nCommon reasons are to meet domestic incineration capacity or favouring domestic recyclers. A more \n\nconsistent implementation of the waste hierarchy and of the proximity principle should help achieve a \n\nmore circular economy. \n\n \n\nThe Waste Market Study70, identified eleven groups of diverging or non-harmonised interpretations of \n\nArticle 11 and 12 of the WSR. These are summarised in the table, below. The findings help to \n\ndifferentiate between individual/country-specific and general/legal approaches. They also serve as a \n\npartial explanation of why different measures have been applied and illustrate certain drivers for \n\nobjecting or restricting waste imports.   \n\n \nTable D-2 Grounds for non-harmonised or diverging interpretations of Article 11 and 12 of the WSR \n\nArticle of WSR  Grounds for non-harmonised interpretation  \n\nArticle 11(a) \n\nInconsistent application of proximity and self-sufficiency principles \n\nThe shipment or disposal is not in accordance with measures taken to implement the proximity \n\nprinciple, priority for recovery and self-sufficiency. Member States apply different forms of \n\ngeneral applications of the proximity principle and thus a systematic objection in case of trans\nfrontier shipment for disposal. \n\nArticle 11(b) and \n\n12(b) \n\nNon-accordance with national legislation \n\nThe shipment or disposal is not in accordance with national legislation relating to environmental \n\nprotection, public order, public safety or health protection. This can only be applied to actions \n\nsuch as treatment, shipment taking place in the objecting country itself. \n\nArticle 11(e) \n\nExercise right pursuant to Article (4)1 of the Basel Convention  \n\nThe inclusion of provisions, like a general ban of waste import for disposal of hazardous wastes, \n\nwaste collected from households, or residues arising from the incineration of household waste in \n\ntheir national legislation, in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Basel Convention. \n\nArticle 11(h) and \n\n12(i) \nWaste treatment in facilities not applying best available techniques. \n\nArticle 12(c) \n\nNon-accordance with national legislation \n\nThe shipment or recovery is not in accordance with national legislation on recovery in the \n\ncountry of dispatch. An objection can be made where the recovery would take place in a facility \n\nwhich has lower treatment standards for the particular waste than those of the country of \n\n \n69 Eunomia (2009) International Review of Waste Management Policy: Annex 65 to Main Report -Exports and Imports \nof Waste \n70 European Commission (2016) The efficient functioning of waste markets in the European Union \n\f\nExpanding the knowledge base on intra-EU waste movements in a circular economy \nFinal report \n\n118 \n\nArticle of WSR  Grounds for non-harmonised interpretation  \n\ndispatch. However, provision of Article 12(1)(c) does not seem to have had any effect on \n\nenvironmental protection and the functioning of the internal market. \n\nArticle 12(g) \n\nUnjustified activities in regard to economic and environmental considerations \n\nThe ratio of the recoverable and non-recoverable waste, the estimated value of the materials \n\nto be finally recovered or the cost of the recovery and the cost of the disposal of the non\nrecoverable fraction do not justify the recovery, having regard to economic and/or \n\nenvironmental considerations. \n\nArticle 12(k) \n\nNon-accordance with waste management plans drawn up pursuant to the WFD \n\nThe waste is not treated in accordance with waste management plans drawn up pursuant to the \n\nWFD with the purpose of ensuring the implementation of legally binding recovery or recycling \n\nobligations established in Community legislation. \n\nUnequal use of administrative procedure of prior notification  \n\nOn the prior notification procedure under the WSR, Member States use the administrative \n\nprocedures in an unequal way, some asking for more proof than others, and requiring different \n\nconditions for the waste shipments, e.g. inconsistent usage of the \u2018pre-authorised facilities\u2019 \n\napproach, relating to the administrative periods. Consequently, the pre-consented recovery \n\nfacility status in the current WSR is not providing any real facilitation of shipment due to the \n\nlack of compliance with the tacit consent and due to different criteria being used in different \n\nMember States. In addition, some MSs do not consider/recognise the status and go through the \n\nusual check list for notification. \n\nArticle 12(k) \n\nNon-harmonisation of municipal waste definition \n\nThe submission of non-harmonised definitions of municipal waste to the proximity principle in \n\ncase of incineration with sufficient energy recovery. \n\nArticle 12(k) \n\nDifferent application of strategies on open or closed borders \n\nDue to the non-obligatory principles of proximity and self-sufficiency for competent authorities, \n\nMember States have different strategies on open or closed borders.  \n\nArticle 12(k) \n\nSubmission to self-sufficiency principle for internal waste shipments for recycling \n\nCertain Member States apply the practices of the self-sufficiency principle, within their own \n\nboarders, for shipments of waste for recycling (as not all recovery capacity is filled).

The information and knowledge in the briefing aims to improve the functioning of secondary material markets by offering insights and potential solutions to help ensure that waste is treated in the best possible way in line with the principles of the waste hierarchy.\nThe EU is currently revising its Waste Shipment Regulation (from 2006), which governs shipments both within the EU and from and to the EU. One of the aims of this revision is to align the regulation with circular economy principles. The revision is based on a study, known as an impact assessment, by the European Commission, analysing the socio-economic and environmental impacts of potential changes to the regulation. The EEA\u2019s work on the EU\u2019s internal waste shipments summarised in this briefing is viewed as complementary to this impact assessment.\nAn essential condition for establishing a circular economy is retaining as high a value as possible for materials that become waste. This will reduce the demand for extracting natural resources, which is associated with significant environmental and climate impacts globally. Meeting the economy\u2019s needs through the good-quality recycling of waste materials has the potential to reduce these impacts substantially. This applies especially to materials that are very energy intensive to produce (e.g. metals), are based on fossil resources (e.g. plastics) or require the use of large amounts of land and water to produce (e.g. textiles). Shipments of non-hazardous waste for recycling purposes could be key to achieving this, especially for improving the secondary raw material markets, which in turn play a key role in meeting the EU\u2019s raw material demands through secondary material sources.\nMore specifically, facilitated but still well-controlled shipments of waste within the EU may lead to the building of economies of scale, reducing the cost of waste treatment and therefore the price of secondary raw materials. Countries or individual stakeholders in the waste sector, if they secure adequate investments, could benefit from economies of scale through access to good-quality, separately collected waste, not only from their own country but also from other EU Member States. This would create opportunities for the development of good-quality, technologically advanced recycling facilities and economically competitive business models.\nMoreover, the right incentives for increasing cross-border shipments of waste for recycling would increase the security of supply for recyclers. This would help recyclers to plan more effectively and, consequently, increase producers\u2019 confidence in steady streams of secondary material resources, which has traditionally been a barrier to the further uptake of secondary materials in new production processes.\nSuch developments could result in lower prices for secondary raw materials produced from waste, with a favourable impact on their cost competitiveness compared with primary raw materials. This in turn could lead to the higher uptake of secondary raw materials in production processes.\nOverall, the promotion of the right type of \u2018intra-EU waste shipments\u2019 of good-quality recyclable waste could optimise the effectiveness of material recovery and increase material circularity, one of the primary objectives of the circular economy policy agenda.\nMore than 90% of the waste generated in the EU is treated in the country in which it was generated. This is in line with the proximity principle underpinning EU waste law, which calls for waste to be treated as close as possible to the point of generation to avoid the environmental impacts of transporting waste and to avoid exporting the impacts of waste management operations. The high share of waste treated in the same country it is generated is the result of decision-making by waste operators taking into account multiple factors, such as regulatory restrictions, economic considerations and environmental issues related to waste transport and treatment (see Figure 1). For example, restrictions and administrative burdens are in place in relation to waste being shipped by individual EU Member States. However, it is important to clarify that it is not the administrative burden associated with waste regulations that ultimatelyblocks the shipment of waste. Instead, it increases waiting times and the costs of shipments, which ultimately decreases profit margins and/or slows down resource movement. Most waste generated has a low intrinsic value compared with long-distance transport costs, meaning that operators would not make a profit if they were to ship waste to other countries.\nHowever, the volume and value of waste shipped across borders within the EU are significant. Over the past 15 years, the share of waste being traded across borders, rather than being treated in the country in which it was generated, has grown, albeit slowly. In 2018, around 6% of the total waste generated was shipped across borders, but within the EU. Table 1 shows the amounts of waste generated, by year, excluding major mineral waste [1], in all EU Member States that are treated abroad, either outside the EU or in another EU Member State. The trends indicate that the secondary material markets for recyclable waste are growing in the EU. If these markets perform optimally, they could be the ideal vehicle for increasing both the quantity and quality of recycling in the EU.\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n2018\nTotal EU waste generated (excl. major mineral wastes)\n781\n790\n760\n759\n758\n770\n785\n809\nTotal waste exported from the EU\n18.6\n19.5\n24\n30\n32\n28\n29\n31\nTotal waste shipped inside the EU\n42\n44.5\n46.4\n46.4\n46.4\n46.4\n45.3\n49.2\nThe value of the commodities traded on secondary material markets is not insignificant: the value of non-hazardous recyclable waste traded across borders within the EU reached EUR 12.2 billion in 2019, with metals accounting for 69% of the total (Table 2). This is approximately equal to the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Malta, indicating significant opportunities in these markets, especially if they are supported by measures to increase the price competitiveness of secondary materials.\nPaper and cardboard\nTextiles\nPlastics\nGlass\nNon-ferrous metals\nFerrous metals\nTotal\nValue (million EUR)\n1,260\n682\n557\n113\n1,227\n8,379\n12,217\nData reported under the EU Waste Shipment Regulation and through Eurostat\u2019s Comext database allow us to understand which waste flows are most prevalent. They also reveal which countries rank highest as destination countries for recyclable waste and in terms of dispatching waste, and if and how the prices of recyclable waste vary depending on the receiving EU Member State. For more details on the Comext database, please consult the technical report underpinning this briefing. An analysis of waste shipments within the EU at national level reveals that some Member States rely more than others on shipping their recyclable waste to other Member States for treatment, while some manage most of their waste within national borders.\nIf a country does not ship much waste to other countries, this might indicate that the country has designed its waste policy in line with the proximity principle, for instance by developing capacity to treat all the types of waste it generates. Another factor influencing how much waste is shipped across borders is country size: in general, smaller countries find it economically unfeasible to develop treatment facilities for all waste and all types of treatment, meaning that some waste has to be shipped elsewhere. In terms of receiving waste, steady and large imports of specific types of recyclable waste indicate that a country is cost competitive for treating those types of waste. This could be the result of the country\u2019s investment in capacity (perhaps due to a particular industrial activity in the country needing the secondary material produced from the waste), the availability of technology and know-how in the country, or factors such as low labour costs.\nOn the other hand, the consistent export of low-value waste is typically associated with exporting polluting activities elsewhere. Through the revision of the Waste Shipment Regulation in 2021, the EU as a whole aims to restrict the exporting of waste to third countries to the minimum, to limit the exporting of environmental issues. Investigating individual countries\u2019 reasons for exporting or importing waste is beyond the scope of this study.\nFigure 2 shows the net shipments of six types of recyclable waste, as well as waste shipped for incineration, per Member State over time.\nNote: \u2018Net shipments\u2019 refer to the volume of dispatched shipments minus the volume of received shipments (in tonnes). A negative value indicates that the volume of dispatched shipments exceeds that of received shipments.\nA closer look at the data shown in Figure 2 gives some insights into intra-EU shipments of specific types of waste:\nIt should be underlined that this briefing covers shipments of waste only within the EU and does not reflect on quantities shipped to outside the Union. This means that countries with large ports might appear to import a relatively large volume of recyclables, while in fact most of these are then shipped out of the EU (e.g. the Netherlands for plastics).\nWithin the scope of this briefing, waste shipped for incineration is the only type of material investigated that is not destined for recycling. This includes mixed municipal waste, sorting residues and other materials not collected separately for recycling. This waste is destined to receive lower level treatment, according to the waste hierarchy, which is associated with greater environmental impacts. Aside from countries with no incineration capacity, EU Member States differ in how they manage their incineration capacities, with some relying on shipments to other Member States for the incineration of residual waste, because of a lack of capacity, and others relying on imports to fill incineration overcapacity (see Figure 3).\nFor example, as shown in Figure 3, Slovakia fills its incineration capacity through imports of residual waste, while, at the other end of the spectrum, Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Slovenia are heavily reliant on shipments to other countries for the incineration of their waste, which might indicate a lack of capacity for incinerating locally generated waste. It should be noted that Figure 3 relates exclusively to waste shipped from one EU Member State to another. However, EU Member States also export and import waste to and from countries outside the EU (e.g. imports of waste for incineration from the United Kingdom and exports to Norway and Switzerland).\nNote: Residual waste consists of waste with the following codes: 191210 combustible waste (refuse derived fuel), 191212 other wastes (including mixtures of materials) from mechanical treatment of wastes and 200301 mixed municipal waste.\nFigure 4 shows the value per unit of recyclable waste shipped from each Member State in 2019. If it is assumed that the value of recyclable waste is an indication of its quality for recycling, it can be deduced that countries that ship high-value recyclable waste to other countries have good waste management systems in place (e.g. separate collection, advanced sorting, etc.) or possibly lack the infrastructure to complete all steps of the recycling value chain within their own borders.\nA closer look at the data shown in Figure 4 helps to explain why shipments from some countries fetch better prices than those from other countries. In other words, these data shed some light on what determines the price of a waste shipment. A good example comes from Cyprus, where more than two thirds of shipments of paper and cardboard waste have already been sorted, making the value of the shipped materials generally higher than that of the unsorted streams shipped by other Member States.\nPlastic waste shipped from Portugal generally comprises polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PET mixed with other plastics. The fact that PET generally has the highest value of all plastic waste is thought to explain the higher value per tonne of plastic waste shipments from Portugal than from other Member States. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Cyprus generally ships only mixed plastic waste, accounting for the relatively low value of shipped plastic waste from this country. This pattern is seen among other Member States: the higher the degree of sorting of plastic waste before shipment, the greater the value of the plastic waste shipped.\nThe composition of shipments also plays a key role in determining the value of other types of waste shipments. For example, almost 85% of non-ferrous metal shipments from Ireland comprise lead scrap, which has a relatively high average market value and is therefore likely to explain the higher value of non-ferrous scrap from Ireland than from other EU Member States. Within the ferrous metal category, Ireland is also a clear outlier. Ireland\u2019s shipments to other EU Member States are dominated by shredded iron and steel (61% of total shipments) and ferrous metal alloys (25% of total shipments). However, it is the value of stainless steel scrap from Ireland that appears to account for the biggest difference in value between Ireland and other Member States.\nIn general, the functioning of a country\u2019s waste management system is a critical determinant of the value of waste shipments. Extensive separate collection and optimal sorting of waste into different quality grades result in large quantities of relatively homogeneous waste material, which can be traded at higher prices. On the other hand, mixed waste, where high-quality materials are mixed with low-quality materials, is generally traded at lower prices.\nThe data presented here cannot, however, account for other aspects that determine the value of waste shipments, such as the technological specialisation of some countries for recycling specific waste materials, the investment in economies of scale for treatment facilities by some countries, or the role of labour and transportation costs. Further analysis, investigating economic conditions in each country, is necessary to account for these aspects.\n[1] Major mineral waste is generated in high volumes and is scarcely moved across borders because of its high weight and low value. Therefore, including this type of waste in Table 1 would skew the conclusions drawn from it.\nBriefing no. 14/2021\nTitle: Linking cross-border shipments of waste in the EU with the circular economy\nHTML - TH-AM-21-014-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-409-9 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/579515\nPDF - TH-AM-21-014-EN-N - ISBN ISBN: 978-92-9480-410-5 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/013029\nDisclaimer\nThe country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/linking-cross-border-shipments-of/linking-cross-border-shipments-of or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:54 PM\nFiled under: waste shipments circular economy\nFiled under: waste shipments, circular economy\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

This means that countries with large ports might appear to import a relatively large volume of recyclables, while in fact most of these are then shipped out of the EU (e.g. the Netherlands for plastics).\nWithin the scope of this briefing, waste shipped for incineration is the only type of material investigated that is not destined for recycling. This includes mixed municipal waste, sorting residues and other materials not collected separately for recycling. This waste is destined to receive lower level treatment, according to the waste hierarchy, which is associated with greater environmental impacts. Aside from countries with no incineration capacity, EU Member States differ in how they manage their incineration capacities, with some relying on shipments to other Member States for the incineration of residual waste, because of a lack of capacity, and others relying on imports to fill incineration overcapacity (see Figure 3).\nFor example, as shown in Figure 3, Slovakia fills its incineration capacity through imports of residual waste, while, at the other end of the spectrum, Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Slovenia are heavily reliant on shipments to other countries for the incineration of their waste, which might indicate a lack of capacity for incinerating locally generated waste. It should be noted that Figure 3 relates exclusively to waste shipped from one EU Member State to another. However, EU Member States also export and import waste to and from countries outside the EU (e.g. imports of waste for incineration from the United Kingdom and exports to Norway and Switzerland).\nNote: Residual waste consists of waste with the following codes: 191210 combustible waste (refuse derived fuel), 191212 other wastes (including mixtures of materials) from mechanical treatment of wastes and 200301 mixed municipal waste.\nFigure 4 shows the value per unit of recyclable waste shipped from each Member State in 2019. If it is assumed that the value of recyclable waste is an indication of its quality for recycling, it can be deduced that countries that ship high-value recyclable waste to other countries have good waste management systems in place (e.g. separate collection, advanced sorting, etc.) or possibly lack the infrastructure to complete all steps of the recycling value chain within their own borders.\nA closer look at the data shown in Figure 4 helps to explain why shipments from some countries fetch better prices than those from other countries. In other words, these data shed some light on what determines the price of a waste shipment. A good example comes from Cyprus, where more than two thirds of shipments of paper and cardboard waste have already been sorted, making the value of the shipped materials generally higher than that of the unsorted streams shipped by other Member States.\nPlastic waste shipped from Portugal generally comprises polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PET mixed with other plastics. The fact that PET generally has the highest value of all plastic waste is thought to explain the higher value per tonne of plastic waste shipments from Portugal than from other Member States. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Cyprus generally ships only mixed plastic waste, accounting for the relatively low value of shipped plastic waste from this country. This pattern is seen among other Member States: the higher the degree of sorting of plastic waste before shipment, the greater the value of the plastic waste shipped.\nThe composition of shipments also plays a key role in determining the value of other types of waste shipments. For example, almost 85% of non-ferrous metal shipments from Ireland comprise lead scrap, which has a relatively high average market value and is therefore likely to explain the higher value of non-ferrous scrap from Ireland than from other EU Member States. Within the ferrous metal category, Ireland is also a clear outlier. Ireland\u2019s shipments to other EU Member States are dominated by shredded iron and steel (61% of total shipments) and ferrous metal alloys (25% of total shipments). However, it is the value of stainless steel scrap from Ireland that appears to account for the biggest difference in value between Ireland and other Member States.\nIn general, the functioning of a country\u2019s waste management system is a critical determinant of the value of waste shipments. Extensive separate collection and optimal sorting of waste into different quality grades result in large quantities of relatively homogeneous waste material, which can be traded at higher prices. On the other hand, mixed waste, where high-quality materials are mixed with low-quality materials, is generally traded at lower prices.\nThe data presented here cannot, however, account for other aspects that determine the value of waste shipments, such as the technological specialisation of some countries for recycling specific waste materials, the investment in economies of scale for treatment facilities by some countries, or the role of labour and transportation costs. Further analysis, investigating economic conditions in each country, is necessary to account for these aspects.\n[1] Major mineral waste is generated in high volumes and is scarcely moved across borders because of its high weight and low value. Therefore, including this type of waste in Table 1 would skew the conclusions drawn from it.\nBriefing no. 14/2021\nTitle: Linking cross-border shipments of waste in the EU with the circular economy\nHTML - TH-AM-21-014-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-409-9 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/579515\nPDF - TH-AM-21-014-EN-N - ISBN ISBN: 978-92-9480-410-5 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/013029\nDisclaimer\nThe country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/linking-cross-border-shipments-of/linking-cross-border-shipments-of or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 08:39 PM\nFiled under: waste shipments circular economy\nFiled under: waste shipments, circular economy\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Its extraction and production of material resources have significant impacts on the environment and human health, as well as on the economy. It is essential to reuse such resources in European economies, keeping their value high, delivering value for longer periods and reducing the need to use virgin materials. While progress is being made in Europe, by implementing an ambitious waste policy and the Circular Economy Framework, significant amounts of valuable resources are still lost through inefficient waste management practices. This briefing describes material losses in Europe for some key waste streams, namely waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), end-of-life batteries, plastic waste and textile waste.\nTechnological change drives the continuous substitution of electrical and electronic equipment. The amount of waste (WEEE, also called e-waste) is steadily increasing and is one of the fastest growing waste streams in Europe. The amount of WEEE generated in Europe is over 10 million tonnes per year, roughly 40 % of which is currently collected for recycling (Huisman et al., 2017). The generation of WEEE is expected to increase in the future, and improvements in collection systems and awareness raising among consumers are needed to ensure increased recycling, leading to reduced losses.\nWEEE contains precious metals and several critical raw materials that are fundamental to the functioning of key industrial sectors and applications. Although base metals such as ferrous metals, aluminium and copper from WEEE are already largely recycled, many critical raw materials or rare Earth elements cannot be effectively recovered because of low market prices that do not cover recycling costs, a lack of recycling technologies on a commercial scale or metallurgical limits to recovery processes (Thi\u00e9baud et al., 2018).\nAs WEEE also includes hazardous materials and chemicals that pose environmental and health risks, Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Although prohibited by EU legislation, cross-boundary transport of WEEE is known to take place between Europe and developing countries, where the environmental regulations are not as strict and labour costs are lower, creating additional environmental and health risks in these locations (Tansel, 2017).\nNonetheless, evidence exists that high-quality recycling can ensure the effective recovery of materials and energy from WEEE. A recent Norwegian study suggests that approximately 1 kg of CO2 equivalent is saved by the responsible recycling of a single mobile phone handset. By promoting the collection and recycling of mobile phones, Norway could save 2 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year (Baxter et al., 2016).\nMany electrical and electronics products are not properly designed for recycling. Design choices that increase the marketability and durability of high-tech products create recycling challenges for separating components and material recovery. For example, miniaturisation and structurally integrated materials make disassembly and recovery more difficult. Although waste collection and waste management are key to reducing the loss of WEEE, more circular and recycling-friendly designs, supplies and manufacturing phases would result in longer product lifespans, modularity, standardisation of parts, easier remanufacturing, etc.\nOver 1.9 million tonnes of waste batteries are generated annually in Europe (Eurostat), and the amount is expected to increase in the future. Huge variations exist between different battery types in terms of their chemical composition and construction. Batteries contain a wide variety of materials, such as base metals, critical raw materials and hazardous substances. Therefore, collection and recycling rates, the profitability of recycling and impacts on the environment and health strongly depend on the battery type. The recovery of materials from waste batteries is driven by both waste policies and the economic value of the materials.\nLead-acid batteries account for a major share of all batteries placed in the market and collected as waste. Recycling of lead-acid batteries is well established, and it is estimated that 99 % of lead-acid batteries are collected for recycling (Eurobat, 2014). Because the process is relatively simple it is also profitable. The efficiency of recycling the lead content of lead-acid batteries is over 95 % in most EU countries. The use of secondary lead can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds compared with the primary production of lead (Stahl et al., 2018). Antimony, which is a critical raw material, is used as an additive in lead-acid batteries, and almost all of it is currently recovered and is the main source of secondary antimony (Dupont et al., 2016).\nThe average collection rate for portable batteries in the EU is much lower than that for lead-acid batteries at 46 % (Eurostat). A significant amount is therefore estimated to end up in municipal waste (35 kilotonnes per year). In particular, batteries embedded in electronic appliances often do not reach official collection points but are stored in consumers\u2019 homes, exported outside the EU in used products or end up in WEEE recycling (Stahl et al., 2018). Although collection rates have increased continuously since 2009, substantial amounts of end-of-life batteries are still unreported.\nIn lithium-ion batteries, various active materials are used in thin coatings, which makes the recycling process more complicated and not very profitable. However, the lithium-ion battery sector is expected to grow in the near future, especially for industrial batteries and batteries used in electrical vehicles.\nIn Europe, more than 9.5 million tonnes of textiles are consumed annually, and the yearly disposal of textiles is estimated to be 5.6 million tonnes in total. More than 4 million tonnes of textile waste is not collected separately and generally ends up in mixed municipal solid waste, and 1.5 million tonnes of worn textiles are exported outside the EU.\nReliable and up-to-date data are limited for textile waste, and informal reuse (donation between family and friends) or reuse through second-hand shops is not included in waste statistics. Although there are some recent studies in several countries, there are no overall data for the EU as a whole on separate collection rates of textile waste. Based on a study of seven countries using data for 2014 or earlier, it was estimated that only 20 % of textiles are separately collected for reuse and recycling, and thus 80 % are lost (GFA & BCG 2017). Of the separately collected textiles, the reusable fraction is mainly exported and sold in foreign markets, while the non-reusable fraction is downcycled.\nMixed fibres and embedded hazardous substances make recycling difficult. Policymakers\u2019 responses should include designing for circularity, easy material identification and improved collection systems.\nThe potential environmental gains that could be achieved through more extensive reuse or recycling are high: producing textiles is associated with significant environmental impacts, such as CO2 emissions, high water and land use, and chemical pollution, mainly caused by cotton production. As Europe is a net importer of textiles, the impacts avoided will mainly occur outside Europe.\nThe European Commission\u2019s 2019 Report on the implementation of the circular economy action plan addresses the strengthening and extension of obligations for separate collection of textile waste by the end of 2025.\nAround 30 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated in the EU from almost all economic sectors. Of this, only 5 million tonnes are recycled in Europe and 25 million tonnes are lost, including misplaced waste and process losses in recycling (Material Economics, 2018). Nearly half of plastic packaging waste was exported outside Europe in 2015, mainly to China; lately, this has also included other countries in Asia (EC, 2018).\nPresently, only part of the plastics collected can be reprocessed because of mixed streams, contamination and additive contents, which hamper recycling. Certain aspects of design and the presence of embedded hazardous and toxic substances make recycling technically and economically difficult. Furthermore, plastic waste is typically only recycled a few times because of material degradation, making downcycling (i.e. non-functional recycling) very common. Only 6 % of new plastic materials are derived from recycled plastics (EC, 2018), as plastic recyclables do not normally meet the material requirements for use in the same application.\nThe packaging sector is the single biggest contributor to plastic waste, generating around 16 million tonnes. This is followed by plastic waste from WEEE, the construction and demolition sector, and end-of-life vehicles. Packaging products \u2014 particularly single-use plastics \u2014 are typically used for a short time and quickly end up as waste.\nAround 43 % of the plastic waste generated by the packaging sector in the EU-28 in 2016 was collected and the rest was disposed of in landfills or incinerated with energy recovery. Inadequate collection systems, together with the relatively low prices of virgin materials and high costs of sorting and processing (including investment costs), are the main challenges associated with the losses of plastic packaging waste.\nIn 2018, a European strategy for plastics in a circular economy was adopted. The strategy aims to transform the way plastics and plastic products are designed, produced, used and recycled. By 2030, all plastic packaging should be recyclable. In addition, the Single Use Plastics Directive requires measures to be taken to increase the collection of plastic bottles, the recycling of plastic packaging and the reduction of the consumption of plastic food containers.\nPlastic products often also appear in paints, glues and binding agents in the construction sector, making recovery of plastic materials challenging and costly. The inclusion of plastic-containing components in building stock is considerable. Every year, about 1 million tonnes of plastic waste from construction is generated in Europe: among this plastic waste, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) has the highest recycling rate (32 %) (Plastics Europe, 2017). Technical challenges in recovering recyclable plastics from end-of-life vehicles and WEEE exist, and efforts dedicated to these waste streams mainly focus on metal recovery.\nPoor or inadequate collection is a serious challenge that is linked to almost all of the waste streams analysed. Consumer awareness is another important factor in increasing the collection rates of different waste fractions. There are also various challenges related to the quality of waste materials, such as material heterogeneity and the presence of hazardous substances that hamper recycling.\nFor some materials, technological challenges are also important reasons for losses, as well as the lack of a market or demand for recyclables. The reasons for material losses are often cross-linked, e.g. waste quality (heterogeneity) and a lack of cost-efficient technology. More efforts are needed to introduce efficient systems for collecting and sorting waste. In addition, it is important to raise consumer awareness of how to achieve higher collection rates.\nThis briefing builds on the report Are we losing resources when managing Europe\u2019s waste, compiled by the EEA and the European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE).

Its extraction and production of material resources have significant impacts on the environment and human health, as well as on the economy. It is essential to reuse such resources in European economies, keeping their value high, delivering value for longer periods and reducing the need to use virgin materials. While progress is being made in Europe, by implementing an ambitious waste policy and the Circular Economy Framework, significant amounts of valuable resources are still lost through inefficient waste management practices. This briefing describes material losses in Europe for some key waste streams, namely waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), end-of-life batteries, plastic waste and textile waste.\nTechnological change drives the continuous substitution of electrical and electronic equipment. The amount of waste (WEEE, also called e-waste) is steadily increasing and is one of the fastest growing waste streams in Europe. The amount of WEEE generated in Europe is over 10 million tonnes per year, roughly 40 % of which is currently collected for recycling (Huisman et al., 2017). The generation of WEEE is expected to increase in the future, and improvements in collection systems and awareness raising among consumers are needed to ensure increased recycling, leading to reduced losses.\nWEEE contains precious metals and several critical raw materials that are fundamental to the functioning of key industrial sectors and applications. Although base metals such as ferrous metals, aluminium and copper from WEEE are already largely recycled, many critical raw materials or rare Earth elements cannot be effectively recovered because of low market prices that do not cover recycling costs, a lack of recycling technologies on a commercial scale or metallurgical limits to recovery processes (Thi\u00e9baud et al., 2018).\nAs WEEE also includes hazardous materials and chemicals that pose environmental and health risks, Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Although prohibited by EU legislation, cross-boundary transport of WEEE is known to take place between Europe and developing countries, where the environmental regulations are not as strict and labour costs are lower, creating additional environmental and health risks in these locations (Tansel, 2017).\nNonetheless, evidence exists that high-quality recycling can ensure the effective recovery of materials and energy from WEEE. A recent Norwegian study suggests that approximately 1 kg of CO2 equivalent is saved by the responsible recycling of a single mobile phone handset. By promoting the collection and recycling of mobile phones, Norway could save 2 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year (Baxter et al., 2016).\nMany electrical and electronics products are not properly designed for recycling. Design choices that increase the marketability and durability of high-tech products create recycling challenges for separating components and material recovery. For example, miniaturisation and structurally integrated materials make disassembly and recovery more difficult. Although waste collection and waste management are key to reducing the loss of WEEE, more circular and recycling-friendly designs, supplies and manufacturing phases would result in longer product lifespans, modularity, standardisation of parts, easier remanufacturing, etc.\nOver 1.9 million tonnes of waste batteries are generated annually in Europe (Eurostat), and the amount is expected to increase in the future. Huge variations exist between different battery types in terms of their chemical composition and construction. Batteries contain a wide variety of materials, such as base metals, critical raw materials and hazardous substances. Therefore, collection and recycling rates, the profitability of recycling and impacts on the environment and health strongly depend on the battery type. The recovery of materials from waste batteries is driven by both waste policies and the economic value of the materials.\nLead-acid batteries account for a major share of all batteries placed in the market and collected as waste. Recycling of lead-acid batteries is well established, and it is estimated that 99 % of lead-acid batteries are collected for recycling (Eurobat, 2014). Because the process is relatively simple it is also profitable. The efficiency of recycling the lead content of lead-acid batteries is over 95 % in most EU countries. The use of secondary lead can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds compared with the primary production of lead (Stahl et al., 2018). Antimony, which is a critical raw material, is used as an additive in lead-acid batteries, and almost all of it is currently recovered and is the main source of secondary antimony (Dupont et al., 2016).\nThe average collection rate for portable batteries in the EU is much lower than that for lead-acid batteries at 46 % (Eurostat). A significant amount is therefore estimated to end up in municipal waste (35 kilotonnes per year). In particular, batteries embedded in electronic appliances often do not reach official collection points but are stored in consumers\u2019 homes, exported outside the EU in used products or end up in WEEE recycling (Stahl et al., 2018). Although collection rates have increased continuously since 2009, substantial amounts of end-of-life batteries are still unreported.\nIn lithium-ion batteries, various active materials are used in thin coatings, which makes the recycling process more complicated and not very profitable. However, the lithium-ion battery sector is expected to grow in the near future, especially for industrial batteries and batteries used in electrical vehicles.\nIn Europe, more than 9.5 million tonnes of textiles are consumed annually, and the yearly disposal of textiles is estimated to be 5.6 million tonnes in total. More than 4 million tonnes of textile waste is not collected separately and generally ends up in mixed municipal solid waste, and 1.5 million tonnes of worn textiles are exported outside the EU.\nReliable and up-to-date data are limited for textile waste, and informal reuse (donation between family and friends) or reuse through second-hand shops is not included in waste statistics. Although there are some recent studies in several countries, there are no overall data for the EU as a whole on separate collection rates of textile waste. Based on a study of seven countries using data for 2014 or earlier, it was estimated that only 20 % of textiles are separately collected for reuse and recycling, and thus 80 % are lost (GFA & BCG 2017). Of the separately collected textiles, the reusable fraction is mainly exported and sold in foreign markets, while the non-reusable fraction is downcycled.\nMixed fibres and embedded hazardous substances make recycling difficult. Policymakers\u2019 responses should include designing for circularity, easy material identification and improved collection systems.\nThe potential environmental gains that could be achieved through more extensive reuse or recycling are high: producing textiles is associated with significant environmental impacts, such as CO2 emissions, high water and land use, and chemical pollution, mainly caused by cotton production. As Europe is a net importer of textiles, the impacts avoided will mainly occur outside Europe.\nThe European Commission\u2019s 2019 Report on the implementation of the circular economy action plan addresses the strengthening and extension of obligations for separate collection of textile waste by the end of 2025.\nAround 30 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated in the EU from almost all economic sectors. Of this, only 5 million tonnes are recycled in Europe and 25 million tonnes are lost, including misplaced waste and process losses in recycling (Material Economics, 2018). Nearly half of plastic packaging waste was exported outside Europe in 2015, mainly to China; lately, this has also included other countries in Asia (EC, 2018).\nPresently, only part of the plastics collected can be reprocessed because of mixed streams, contamination and additive contents, which hamper recycling. Certain aspects of design and the presence of embedded hazardous and toxic substances make recycling technically and economically difficult. Furthermore, plastic waste is typically only recycled a few times because of material degradation, making downcycling (i.e. non-functional recycling) very common. Only 6 % of new plastic materials are derived from recycled plastics (EC, 2018), as plastic recyclables do not normally meet the material requirements for use in the same application.\nThe packaging sector is the single biggest contributor to plastic waste, generating around 16 million tonnes. This is followed by plastic waste from WEEE, the construction and demolition sector, and end-of-life vehicles. Packaging products \u2014 particularly single-use plastics \u2014 are typically used for a short time and quickly end up as waste.\nAround 43 % of the plastic waste generated by the packaging sector in the EU-28 in 2016 was collected and the rest was disposed of in landfills or incinerated with energy recovery. Inadequate collection systems, together with the relatively low prices of virgin materials and high costs of sorting and processing (including investment costs), are the main challenges associated with the losses of plastic packaging waste.\nIn 2018, a European strategy for plastics in a circular economy was adopted. The strategy aims to transform the way plastics and plastic products are designed, produced, used and recycled. By 2030, all plastic packaging should be recyclable. In addition, the Single Use Plastics Directive requires measures to be taken to increase the collection of plastic bottles, the recycling of plastic packaging and the reduction of the consumption of plastic food containers.\nPlastic products often also appear in paints, glues and binding agents in the construction sector, making recovery of plastic materials challenging and costly. The inclusion of plastic-containing components in building stock is considerable. Every year, about 1 million tonnes of plastic waste from construction is generated in Europe: among this plastic waste, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) has the highest recycling rate (32 %) (Plastics Europe, 2017). Technical challenges in recovering recyclable plastics from end-of-life vehicles and WEEE exist, and efforts dedicated to these waste streams mainly focus on metal recovery.\nPoor or inadequate collection is a serious challenge that is linked to almost all of the waste streams analysed. Consumer awareness is another important factor in increasing the collection rates of different waste fractions. There are also various challenges related to the quality of waste materials, such as material heterogeneity and the presence of hazardous substances that hamper recycling.\nFor some materials, technological challenges are also important reasons for losses, as well as the lack of a market or demand for recyclables. The reasons for material losses are often cross-linked, e.g. waste quality (heterogeneity) and a lack of cost-efficient technology. More efforts are needed to introduce efficient systems for collecting and sorting waste. In addition, it is important to raise consumer awareness of how to achieve higher collection rates.\nThis briefing builds on the report Are we losing resources when managing Europe\u2019s waste, compiled by the EEA and the European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE).

This briefing shows that there is significant potential to increase recycling from all of these streams. However, to fully exploit this potential, current barriers need to be overcome, e.g. price competition from virgin resource alternatives, infrastructure capacity and the complexity of certain waste products. This also requires strong implementation of targeted regulations to increase separate collection. Implementing new policy measures, some of which are already included in Europe\u2019s 2020 circular economy action plan, can both directly and indirectly exploit the potential for increased recycling.\nThis briefing summarises the key findings of a technical report commissioned by the EEA.\nWaste policies at EU level follow principles designed to achieve a gradual, but steady, increase in the level of recycling of a waste stream compared with the amount generated. The Waste Framework Directive (WFD) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive are based on the premise of increasing recycling rates for municipal and construction and demolition waste as well as for electronic waste. In addition, Europe\u2019s circular economy agenda calls for keeping materials in the economy for as long as possible and their value as high as possible.\nSource: EEA\nTechnical, economic and social issues often hinder achieving more ambitious levels of recycling, beyond the targets set. Examples include, respectively:\nthe presence of technically non-recyclable materials and products in waste streams;\nthe increasing cost of separate collection as more materials are collected;\nconsumers\u2019 difficulty in distinguishing and correctly separating materials in complex products.\nAgainst this background, the underlying question emerges: \u2018What is the potential for recycling, and what are the maximum recycling levels Europe can achieve under currently implemented EU waste legislation?\nThis briefing provides estimates of the untapped potential for separate collection for recycling (see Box 1) in three waste streams and puts future developments in policymaking in perspective. It examines the municipal, construction and demolition (mineral part only), and electronic waste streams. Together, these comprise a significant part of total waste generation in Europe.\nThe estimates presented are based on the latest available data and the current status of implementation of EU waste legislation. This means that the measures in the latest circular economy action plan of the European Green Deal and some of the most recent amendments to EU waste directives are not taken into account. These might have a profound effect on the levels of separate collection that could be achieved.\nPlease note that the calculations of the untapped potential for collection for recycling also might change once waste prevention measures are further implemented. This is because both the amount of waste generated and the material recyclability will be affected by, for example, the phasing out of hazardous substances in products.\nThe methodology for estimating the potential increase in separate collection for each of the selected waste streams is based on:\neither reports in the literature estimating theoretical upper limit values for separate collection of specific materials, or\nbenchmarks of separate collection achieved in specific areas and specific waste management system configurations.\nA detailed description of the methodology can be found in the technical report.\nNote: Data for construction and demolition waste are from the EU-28, Iceland and Norway (2016). Data for municipal waste are from the EU-28, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey (2018). Data for electronic waste are from the EU-28, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (2017).\nSource: Eurostat, EEA.\nAlthough the latest data available (2016) show that the current levels of recycling of construction and demolition waste are already high (Figure 2), the nature of this waste stream\u2019s material fractions may enable even higher separate collection rates.\nIn 2016, most of the non-recycled waste was used for \u2018backfilling\u2019 operations, e.g. using waste material to fill excavated holes. However, backfilling is not considered recycling and it is not the most environmentally sound waste treatment option.\nTaking account of the material composition of this waste stream, the maximum potential for separately collecting each material fraction was estimated. By combining these estimates per material, a potential separate collection rate for the entire stream was calculated at 96 % or 76 million tonnes more separate collection than the 2016 level of around 250 million tonnes. This potential is mainly based on increasing separate collection of masonry, concrete and asphalt wastes. The calculations account for only the mineral part of construction and demolition waste for both waste generation and recycling.\nThe target for 2020 stands at 70 % recovery (all waste, not just the mineral part), so there is room for potentially increasing the target in the future, especially by upgrading waste currently used in backfilling to recycled waste.\nSeparate collection of municipal waste, stimulated by ambitious EU legislation, is steadily increasing over time. New, higher recycling targets were introduced in the amended Waste Framework Directive in 2018, which indicates even higher separate collection in the future.\nAn estimate for this stream shows that the potential for increased separate collection of waste is above the future EU targets. If all the potential is harnessed, separate collection rates of around 80 % can be achieved (Figure 2). This means that 111 million tonnes more material could be separately collected (in 2018, recycling stood at 126 million tonnes), based on waste generation in 2018. This untapped potential is mainly linked to food and plastic but also garden and textile wastes.\nThe amended 2018 Directive introduced a target for recycling of 65 % by 2035. This is particularly ambitious, compared with the estimated maximum potential of 80 %. The target refers to final recycled amounts, not to amounts of waste collected for recycling. The latter includes amounts of non-recyclable materials or contaminants, which are removed during waste processing, so the 80 % potential for separate collection corresponds to lower levels of final recycling.\nThis is the smallest waste stream, in terms of mass, examined in this briefing. Electronic waste, however, contains valuable resources (e.g. metals and critical raw materials). It is also the waste stream with the lowest recycling rate, mainly because of failures in separately collecting this type of waste (see Box 2). As electronic waste is composed mainly of metals, plastic and glass, which are routinely recycled (unless they contain hazardous substances), there is a significant opportunity to increase recycling.\nThe estimation of the maximum collection rate for recycling, unlike the other waste streams, is not based on the stream\u2019s material composition, as the separate collection of this waste is not designed per material but per product category. Therefore, based on the latest official data for maximum recycling achieved per waste product category, the potential for separate collection of electronic waste for recycling stands at 4 million tonnes of additional separate collection, or a 75 % separate collection rate (Figure 2).\nWaste from electrical and electronic equipment is somewhat different from the other waste streams examined in this briefing. The main issues that waste management systems face are collecting electronic waste separately from other streams and avoiding illegal exports and recycling under non-compliant conditions.\nAnother issue is that many waste materials and products are contaminated with hazardous substances, such as flame retardants, making recycling difficult or impossible, as these substances cannot be recirculated into the economy for health reasons.\nThe circular economy agenda is particularly relevant to electronic waste as it calls for a reduction in hazardous substances in products to improve their recyclability and for measures such as the \u2018right to repair\u2019 and incentives to design-for-recycling. Therefore, implementing circular economy-related measures for this type of waste would enable us to realise much of the untapped potential for recycling.\nA separate recent EEA briefing provides additional information on this waste stream.\nThe barriers to increasing separate collection of waste for recycling can be common to all three waste streams or waste stream specific.\nOf the common barriers, the markets for recyclables often underperform. The price differential between recycled materials and virgin material alternatives is normally unfavourable. Moreover, the consequently relatively low revenues from recyclables strain the economics underpinning separate collection systems.\nAnother issue is that the quality of materials collected for recycling can vary, meaning that recycling plants cannot count on streamlined inputs of materials with a specific quality. Recyclers cannot count either on pan-European end-of-waste criteria for all recyclables. The combination of these factors explains the weak demand for some recyclables from processing and recycling plants.\nBarriers of a more technical nature include the lack of recycling infrastructures in Europe, especially for emerging recyclables such as plastics. This means that increasing quantities of materials collected for recycling cannot be accommodated in European plants and are often exported for further processing. Another technical barrier is the very nature of waste materials and products: some materials are technically non-recyclable or are composed of mixed materials that are hard to separate.\nTo overcome these barriers, Europe needs strong and effective regulation in combination with effective implementation and enforcement. More specifically, regulations on the following could lead to significantly more separately collected waste:\nmandatory separate collection (municipal waste);\neffective extended producer responsibility schemes regulated by fees (electronic waste);\nselective demolition (construction and demolition waste).\nFurthermore, in the unfavourable secondary material markets, the use of taxes and subsidies might be further explored to promote the uptake of recyclables and assist the transition to a more circular economy. Phasing out hazardous substances in products and developing standards for recyclables would increase products\u2019 recyclability and lead to a stronger demand in the secondary material markets.\nThe 2020 circular economy action plan addresses many of the barriers hindering significant increases in recycling and also introduces measures that can be taken at product design and use stages. The wide uptake of measures such as phasing out hazardous substances in products, design-for-recycling or design-for-disassembly, and the \u2018right to repair\u2019 initiative would make more material available for separate collection and therefore recycling.\nThe action plan also proposes harmonising separate collection systems, which would increase their efficiency and lead to more recyclables being captured in separate collection schemes. Circular economy measures may also increase the potential for recycling, as estimated in this briefing, by enabling the recycling of currently non-recyclable materials and products.\nBriefing no. 03/2020\nTitle: The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\nPDF TH-AM-20-004-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-233-0 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/72478\nHTML TH-AM-20-004-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-234-7 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/5309\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union did not affect the production of this briefing.

Collection for recycling and final recycling\n\nThe recycling value chain starts with the separate collection of materials in\nwaste bins for a single material or a group of waste materials. This is\nfollowed by sorting and compaction before the recyclables are delivered to\nrecycling plants. Our analysis focuses on estimating the limits on recycling\nat the collection point, defined as the amount of waste collected for\nrecycling for each waste stream, compared with the amount generated.\n\nSeparate collection for municipal waste and for construction and demolition\nwaste means collecting non-hazardous recyclables separately from\nresidual waste. In the case of electronic waste, collection for recycling\nmeans collecting electronic waste separately from other waste streams.\n\nThe final amounts of waste entering recycling plants are lower than the\namounts collected for recycling. Separately collected materials are often\ncontaminated (e.g. paper labels on plastic bottles) or are collected as\nmixed materials requiring further mechanical or chemical separation (e.g.\nTetra Pak milk cartons). This process normally happens in sorting plants,\nwhich separate recyclables from rejects. The average difference between\namounts collected and amounts entering recycling plants has been\nestimated for a number of waste materials.\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Waste management > The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\n\n6\n\nhttps://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3d72ef00-bcac-11e9-9d01-01aa75ed71a1\f\nThe methodology for estimating the potential increase in separate collection for\neach of the selected waste streams is based on:\n\neither reports in the literature estimating theoretical upper limit values for\nseparate collection of specific materials, or\n\nbenchmarks of separate collection achieved in specific areas and specific\nwaste management system configurations.\n\nA detailed description of the methodology can be found in the technical report.\n\nFigure 2.

By\ncombining these estimates per material, a potential separate collection rate for\nthe entire stream was calculated at 96 % or 76 million tonnes more separate\ncollection than the 2016 level of around 250 million tonnes. This potential is\nmainly based on increasing separate collection of masonry, concrete and\nasphalt wastes. The calculations account for only the mineral part of\nconstruction and demolition waste for both waste generation and recycling.\n\nThe target for 2020 stands at 70 % recovery (all waste, not just the mineral part),\nso there is room for potentially increasing the target in the future, especially by\nupgrading waste currently used in backfilling to recycled waste.\n\nMunicipal waste\nSeparate collection of municipal waste, stimulated by ambitious EU legislation,\nis steadily increasing over time. New, higher recycling targets were introduced in\nthe amended Waste Framework Directive in 2018, which indicates even higher\nseparate collection in the future.\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Waste management > The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\n\n8\n\f\nAn estimate for this stream shows that the potential for increased separate\ncollection of waste is above the future EU targets. If all the potential is\nharnessed, separate collection rates of around 80 % can be achieved (Figure 2).\nThis means that 111 million tonnes more material could be separately collected\n(in 2018, recycling stood at 126 million tonnes), based on waste generation in\n2018. This untapped potential is mainly linked to food and plastic but also\ngarden and textile wastes.\n\nThe amended 2018 Directive introduced a target for recycling of 65 % by 2035.\nThis is particularly ambitious, compared with the estimated maximum potential\nof 80 %. The target refers to final recycled amounts, not to amounts of waste\ncollected for recycling. The latter includes amounts of non-recyclable materials\nor contaminants, which are removed during waste processing, so the 80 %\npotential for separate collection corresponds to lower levels of final recycling.\n\nWaste from electrical and electronic\nequipment\nThis is the smallest waste stream, in terms of mass, examined in this briefing.\nElectronic waste, however, contains valuable resources (e.g. metals and critical\nraw materials). It is also the waste stream with the lowest recycling rate, mainly\nbecause of failures in separately collecting this type of waste (see Box 2). As\nelectronic waste is composed mainly of metals, plastic and glass, which are\nroutinely recycled (unless they contain hazardous substances), there is a\nsignificant opportunity to increase recycling.\n\nThe estimation of the maximum collection rate for recycling, unlike the other\nwaste streams, is not based on the stream\ufffds material composition, as the\nseparate collection of this waste is not designed per material but per product\ncategory. Therefore, based on the latest official data for maximum recycling\nachieved per waste product category, the potential for separate collection of\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Waste management > The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\n\n9\n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32018L0851\f\nelectronic waste for recycling stands at 4 million tonnes of additional separate\ncollection, or a 75 % separate collection rate (Figure 2).\n\nBox 2. The special case of electronic waste\n\nWaste from electrical and electronic equipment is somewhat different from\nthe other waste streams examined in this briefing. The main issues that\nwaste management systems face are collecting electronic waste separately\nfrom other streams and avoiding illegal exports and recycling under noncompliant conditions.\n\nAnother issue is that many waste materials and products are contaminated\nwith hazardous substances, such as flame retardants, making recycling\ndifficult or impossible, as these substances cannot be recirculated into the\neconomy for health reasons.\n\nThe circular economy agenda is particularly relevant to electronic waste as\nit calls for a reduction in hazardous substances in products to improve their\nrecyclability and for measures such as the \ufffdright to repair\ufffd and incentives to\ndesign-for-recycling. Therefore, implementing circular economy-related\nmeasures for this type of waste would enable us to realise much of the\nuntapped potential for recycling.\n\nA separate recent EEA briefing provides additional information on this\nwaste stream.\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Waste management > The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\n\n10\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/waste-management/reducing-loss-of-resources-from\f\nBarriers and enablers\nThe barriers to increasing separate collection of waste for recycling can be\ncommon to all three waste streams or waste stream specific.\n\nOf the common barriers, the markets for recyclables often underperform. The\nprice differential between recycled materials and virgin material alternatives is\nnormally unfavourable. Moreover, the consequently relatively low revenues from\nrecyclables strain the economics underpinning separate collection systems.\n\nAnother issue is that the quality of materials collected for recycling can vary,\nmeaning that recycling plants cannot count on streamlined inputs of materials\nwith a specific quality. Recyclers cannot count either on pan-European end-ofwaste criteria for all recyclables. The combination of these factors explains the\nweak demand for some recyclables from processing and recycling plants.\n\nBarriers of a more technical nature include the lack of recycling infrastructures in\nEurope, especially for emerging recyclables such as plastics. This means that\nincreasing quantities of materials collected for recycling cannot be\naccommodated in European plants and are often exported for further\nprocessing. Another technical barrier is the very nature of waste materials and\nproducts: some materials are technically non-recyclable or are composed of\nmixed materials that are hard to separate.\n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Waste management > The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\n\n11\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/resource-efficiency/the-plastic-waste-trade-in\f\nTo overcome these barriers, Europe needs strong and effective regulation in\ncombination with effective implementation and enforcement. More specifically,\nregulations on the following could lead to significantly more separately collected\nwaste:\n\nmandatory separate collection (municipal waste);\n\neffective extended producer responsibility schemes regulated by fees\n(electronic waste);\n\nselective demolition (construction and demolition waste).\n\nFurthermore, in the unfavourable secondary material markets, the use of taxes\nand subsidies might be further explored to promote the uptake of recyclables\nand assist the transition to a more circular economy. Phasing out hazardous\nsubstances in products and developing standards for recyclables would increase\nproducts\ufffd recyclability and lead to a stronger demand in the secondary material\nmarkets.\n\nThe 2020 circular economy action plan addresses many of the barriers hindering\nsignificant increases in recycling and also introduces measures that can be\ntaken at product design and use stages. The wide uptake of measures such as\nphasing out hazardous substances in products, design-for-recycling or designfor-disassembly, and the \ufffdright to repair\ufffd initiative would make more material\navailable for separate collection and therefore recycling.\n\nThe action plan also proposes harmonising separate collection systems, which\nwould increase their efficiency and lead to more recyclables being captured in\nseparate collection schemes. Circular economy measures may also increase the\npotential for recycling, as estimated in this briefing, by enabling the recycling of\ncurrently non-recyclable materials and products.\n\n \n\nResource efficiency and waste\n\nResource efficiency and waste > Waste management > The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\n\n12\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/new_circular_economy_action_plan.pdf\f\nPublished on 18 Jun 2020\n\n \n\nIdentifiers\n\nBriefing no. 03/2020\nTitle: The case for increasing recycling:  Estimating the potential for recycling in\nEurope\n\nPDF TH-AM-20-004-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-233-0 - ISSN 2467-3196 doi: 10.2800/72478\nHTML TH-AM-20-004-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-234-7 - ISSN 2467-3196 doi: 10.2800/5309\n\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union did not affect the\nproduction of this briefing.

Rapidly growing amounts of plastic have negative environmental and climate impacts. Plastic and plastic waste are traded worldwide. Exporting plastic waste from the EU to Asia is a means of dealing with insufficient recycling capacities in the EU. Waste import restrictions in China have shifted exports to other countries. Because some types of plastic waste have been added to the United Nations Basel Convention, the option of exporting plastic waste is becoming increasingly difficult. This requires policymakers, business and other actors to build a more robust and circular economy for plastic in Europe.\nThis briefing provides an overview of exports of plastic waste from the 28 EU Member States (EU-28) to other countries and discusses its possible consequences and opportunities. It builds on a report by the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE).\nA significant proportion of plastic waste is traded, both inside the EU and between the EU and other parts of the world. EU exports of plastic waste to countries outside the EU amounted to around 150 000 tonnes per month at the start of 2019.\nA major redistribution of and reduction in the export of plastic waste from the EU-28 to countries outside the EU took place between January 2017 and April 2019 (Figure 1). As a result of the import restrictions in China, the amount of plastic waste exported to China and Hong Kong has become very limited, and exports have shifted to other destinations.\nSources: Based on Eurostat data (accessed 9 July 2019); ETC/WMGE 2019; EEA.\nThe trend in decreasing exports of plastic waste is likely to result in an increase in incineration and landfilling in the short term, because of the current lack of capacity to increase recycling and reuse in the EU.\nAwareness of the challenge of managing plastic waste has grown only relatively recently, compared with that of managing materials such as paper, glass and metals. This is one of the reasons why the EU still lacks the capacity to reuse, recycle and recover all of its plastic waste and therefore seeks export opportunities.\nWaste is exported because of this lack of capacity and because there is a demand for imports and profits can be made. Exporting plastic waste from the EU to non-EU countries for disposal is prohibited by EU law.\nFor countries in Asia, imports are an option, as large amounts of plastic waste have an economic value. In addition, these countries do not have the same rules and regulations for waste treatment as those in the EU and can therefore manage plastic waste in a less controlled way.\nThe factors that determine and drive the export of plastic waste from the EU to other countries (i.e. how much and to where) include:\nPlastic \u2014 and in particular plastic waste \u2014 has significant impacts on the environment and climate. Plastic has become a serious challenge for the natural world. Plastic waste is, in most cases, not being handled in a sustainable manner. Instead, it is being dumped on land and ending up in oceans and seas worldwide. And the huge negative consequences for our natural environment are becoming more and more apparent.\nPlastic and microplastics destroy marine environments and are either eaten by fish and birds or cause them to become entangled. In many cases, microplastics ingested by fish end up in our bodies through the fish we eat.\nAt the same time, the production of plastic is largely reliant on fossil fuels. The amounts can be compared with those of the aviation sector. Incineration of and energy recovery from plastic waste result in a direct release of greenhouse gas emissions. When plastic is deposited in landfills, carbon can be released into the atmosphere.\nThere is a lack of knowledge on the environmental and climate impacts \u2014 as well as the social impacts \u2014 of exporting plastic waste to countries outside the EU. If plastic waste is mismanaged \u2014 e.g. left uncollected, openly dumped, littered or managed through uncontrolled landfills \u2014 it will result in pollution and climate change. Mismanaged plastic waste has polluted land-based ecosystems, and 80 % of ocean plastic is estimated to come from land-based resources. Greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production and processing, and from plastic waste management \u2014 i.e. from incineration and landfills \u2014 are growing rapidly.\nAt a global level, less than 10 % of about 6 300 million tonnes of plastic waste generated between 1950 and 2015 has been recycled. Over 60 % of the plastic ever made (since 1950) is in landfills or in nature, including in the oceans. The rest has been incinerated or has not been accounted for.\nIf plastic leaks into the environment, it stays there for a long time and can take up to hundreds of years to break down. This causes damage, harms biodiversity and depletes the ecosystem services needed to support life. Plastic can enter nature in the form of either macroscopic litter or micro- or nanoplastics.\nThe global rise in the export of plastic waste to China has gone hand-in-hand with the country\u2019s increasing plastic production capacity and local consumption of plastic products. Meanwhile, plastic product manufacturing and reprocessing in China is shifting from many small, unregistered facilities with no standard operating procedures, no quality standards and no inspections to investments in large manufacturing plants, which are subject to increasing quality and environmental controls.\nMany of the countries to which the EU exports its plastic waste are still in their infancies with respect to developing waste management. Imported waste is often not processed in accordance with European standards and might even be dumped or burned in unregulated ways. This is despite the fact that EU waste legislation states that recovery operations on exported waste must take place under \u2018broadly equivalent conditions\u2019 to those within the EU. Many stakeholders in south-east Asia profit from a lack of legal operators and the failure of authorities to cope with the increased imports.\nA lack of knowledge about what happens to exported plastic waste means that, for the environment and climate, it is preferable to handle the waste internally in the EU, gradually increasing the shares reused and recycled as capacity is generated. Europe has a responsibility to safely manage the waste it generates\nThe EU has taken steps to better manage its plastics and plastic waste. These include the European strategy for plastics in the circular economy and new and more ambitious targets for plastic recycling included in the waste directives of 2018.\nThe Single Use Plastics Directive, which bans and restricts the use of various types of single-use plastics \u2014 e.g. knives, forks and straws \u2014 from 2021 onwards, marks the beginning of a transition towards making plastics more circular.\nEU countries\u2019 trade in plastic waste is regulated by the Waste Shipment Regulation. This prohibits the export of plastic waste for disposal to non-EU countries (except countries in the European Free Trade Area, which are party to the UN Basel Convention) and of hazardous plastic waste for recovery to countries that are not part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nThe recent inclusion of contaminated, mixed or hard-to-recycle plastic waste in the UN Basel Convention (on controlling transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal) is likely to reduce the plastic waste trade with countries outside the EU as an option for plastic waste management. This is likely to cause increased landfilling in the short term, but it will also be a clear signal for EU countries to move towards a more circular plastic economy. This involves preventing plastic waste as far as possible, as well as managing the waste according to the best environmental standards and the highest potential economic benefits, in particular through reuse and recycling.\nFrom 2007 to 2016, the recycling and recovery of plastic packaging waste \u2014 which accounts for the largest fraction of plastic waste and is the category for which reliable data are available \u2014 grew significantly (Figure 2). With recycling rates still significantly under 50 % in the EU, there is huge potential to increase the recycling of plastic packaging.\nCurrently, the management of plastic waste in the EU involves less reuse and recycling than that of more homogeneous materials, such as glass and metals. With the 2018 plastic strategy, the EU has adopted a material-specific life cycle approach to integrating circular design (including through safe by design and safer chemical composition), use, reuse and recycling activities into the plastic value chain.\nCurrently traded European plastic waste could provide substantial amounts of potential (secondary) material resources for the European manufacturing industry. In addition, recycling in the EU would also provide a net benefit for the European economy, through jobs and added value, and for the environment.\nImplementing the EU plastic strategy and the Single Use Plastics Directive will push the EU in this direction by reducing plastic waste with low value and high environmental impact, while improving the quality of plastic waste. This will enable more environmentally and economically sustainable plastic waste management in the EU.\nPlastic is a family of hundreds of different materials \u2014 either fossil fuel based or bio-based \u2014 with a wide variety of properties and uses.\nPlastic is produced and consumed for many purposes. In 2017, in the EU-28, Norway and Switzerland, the total demand for plastic amounted to about 51 million tonnes, divided among the packaging sector (39.7 %), the building and construction sector (19.8 %), the automotive sector (10.1 %), the electrical and electronics sector (6.2 %), the households, leisure and sports sector (4.1 %), the agriculture sector (3.4 %) and other sectors (16.7 %), according to PlasticsEurope.\nPlastic contributes to growth and employment. The European plastic industry is made up of about 60 000 companies, with a turnover of close to EUR 355 billion in 2017, which offer direct employment to over 1.5 million people. About 64 million tonnes of plastic were produced in the EU-28, Norway and Switzerland in 2017.\nPDF TH-AM-19-009-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-102-9 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/220248\nHTML TH-AM-19-009-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-101-2 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/30379\nDisclaimer\nThe country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/the-plastic-waste-trade-in/the-plastic-waste-trade-in or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 11:11 AM\nFiled under: exports plastics circular economy plastic waste trade waste\nFiled under: exports, plastics, circular economy, plastic waste, trade, waste\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

About 64 million tonnes of plastic were produced in the EU-28, Norway and Switzerland in 2017.\nPDF TH-AM-19-009-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-102-9 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/220248\nHTML TH-AM-19-009-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-101-2 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/30379\nDisclaimer\nThe country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/the-plastic-waste-trade-in/the-plastic-waste-trade-in or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 03:04 PM\nFiled under: exports plastics circular economy plastic waste trade waste\nFiled under: exports, plastics, circular economy, plastic waste, trade, waste\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "ETC/WMGE Report 5/2019: Plastics waste trade and the environment28 Oct 2019\nThis ETC/WMGE report provides the detailed analysis underpinning the EEA Briefing \u201cThe plastic waste trade in the circular economy\u201d https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/resource-efficiency/the-plastic-waste-trade-in\nIn doing so, it provides an overview of exports of plastic waste from the EU and discusses its possible consequences and opportunities.\n\nEionet Report - ETC/WMGE 2019/5 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nOctober 2019  \n\n \nPlastics waste trade and the environment \n\nAuthors:  \nAlessio D\u2019Amato (SEEDS), Susanna Paleari (IRcRES-CNR), Maija Pohjakallio \n(VTT), Ive Vanderreydt (VITO), Roberto Zoboli (SEEDS) \n\nETC/WMGE consortium partners: Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), \nCENIA, Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP), Research \nInstitute on Sustainable Economic Growth of National Research Council (IRCrES), The \nPublic Waste Agency of Flanders (OVAM), Sustainability, Environmental Economics and \nDynamic Studies (SEEDS), VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Banson \nCommunications Ireland (BCI), The Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment, Energy \n(WI), Slovak Environment Agency (SEA) \n \n\f\n \n\n \n\n \nCover photo \u00a9 SlobodanMiljevic, 25 June 2015 \niStock photo ID 478409692 \n \nLegal notice \nThe contents of this publication do not necessarily reflect the official opinions of the European Commission or other institutions \nof the European Union.

The usual disclaimer applies.  \n \n\n \n\f\n \n\n2 \n \n\n1 Trade and the changing plastic waste game \n\nInternational trade has been an option for dealing with the growing amount of plastic waste in Europe, \ngiven the weakness of domestic economically viable post-collection treatment and recycling and the \nwillingness of China and Asian countries, amongst others, to import waste. This trade prevailed even \nthough it was known that treatment in non-European Union (EU) countries often caused higher \nenvironmental pressures than treatment/recycling in the EU.  \n\nThe domino-like recent sequence of import restrictions on wastes, including on plastics, adopted by \nChina (2018) and then other non-EU countries is pushing European countries to change their plastic \nwaste management. Even though European export flows have found, for the moment, alternative \ndestinations, the export option is bound to become increasingly difficult. The global plastic waste game is \nchanging, creating both an immediate challenge and an opportunity for the EU. \n\nThe challenge is the domestic capacity for treatment and, in particular, recycling in EU countries. \nAlthough this seems to be slowly increasing, it is currently insufficient, and is now facing the effects of \ndecreasing opportunities for exporting waste beyond the EU. The new and more ambitious recycling \ntargets for plastics included in the 2018 Waste Directives are further exacerbating the challenge.  \n\nThe opportunity is to trigger a more robust and complete circular economy for plastics in Europe. At \npresent, the industrial recycling and recovery system for plastics in the EU is underperforming relative to \nother waste sectors. From a circular economy perspective, this is a loss of materials and value. The \npressure arising from the weakening of export options could push investment and innovation towards \nthe creation of new business opportunities in the EU. At the same time, keeping waste plastics within the \nEU could reduce their net global environmental pressures by securing better environmental \nmanagement, under the EU standards.  \n\nThese changes, challenges and opportunities are taking place within a rapidly evolving policy setting. \n\nThe trade in waste plastics by EU countries is regulated by the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) (EU, \n2006a), which prohibits the export of:  \n\n1) waste plastics for disposal to non-EU countries other than European Free Trade Association \n(EFTA) countries that are party to the Basel Convention; and  \n\n2) hazardous waste plastics for recovery to non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries \u2013 this includes hazardous waste containing plastics, such as endof-life vehicles. \n\nThe shipment of non-hazardous waste plastics for recovery to non-OECD countries is regulated by WSR \nArticle 37, which stipulates that the European Commission has to send a written request to each nonOECD country seeking confirmation in writing that non-hazardous waste may be exported for recovery in \nthat country and under which control procedure, if any. Most non-OECD countries have decided to ban \nthe import of such waste or to allow it under specified control procedures (see Section 4.2). \n\nThe WSR transposes the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous \nWastes and Their Disposal (Basel Convention) into EU law. The Convention, which prohibits the export of \nhazardous waste unless the importing state has given its prior consent in writing to the specific import, \nhas recently been amended, based on a proposal from Norway, extending the current regime to include \ncontaminated, mixed or hard-to-recycle plastic waste1. \n\nAction on plastics has been identified as a key priority by the European Commission and several policies \nand legislation have recently been adopted which may impact the trade in waste plastics directly and \nindirectly. In particular, the 2018 EU Plastic Strategy (EC, 2018a) has shaped a systemic approach aimed \n                                                           \n1 See Rethink Plastic website. https://rethinkplasticalliance.eu/  \n\nhttps://rethinkplasticalliance.eu/\f\n \n\n3 \n \n\nat transforming the way plastic products are designed, produced and recycled in the EU, possibly laying \nthe foundations of a circular plastics economy.  \n\nNew recycling targets for packaging waste, including a specific target for plastic packaging, and for \nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) were set in 2018. A new Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain \nplastic products on the environment (EU, 2019a) has been adopted, which provides, inter alia, for a ban \non some single-use plastic items, the introduction of separate collection targets for recycling and targets \nestablishing a mandatory recycled content in plastic beverage bottles. Other pieces of legislation, for \nexample on chemical substances (EU, 2006), can also affect the waste plastics sector. \n\nThis report aims to contribute to a better understanding of the recent dynamics of the trade in waste \nplastics and the two-way relationship between this trade and the EU Plastics Strategy.  \n\nIn Chapter 2, the EU\u2019s rapidly changing international trade in waste plastics is analysed, including the \nillegal trade in waste plastics. In Chapter 3, the drivers of the waste trade are explored together with the \nenvironmental and economic implications of the international trade and \u2018non-trade\u2019 from Europe. In \nChapter 4, the evolving policy framework for the trade in waste plastics is addressed by focusing on EU \nplastics and waste policies, and a set of options to better manage the trade within those policies is \nsuggested.  \n\n  \n\f\n \n\n4 \n \n\n2 European countries\u2019 trade in waste plastics \n\n2.1. Plastics production, consumption, and waste \n\nThe annual global production of plastics has increased from 2 million tonnes in 1950 to 380 million tonnes \nin 2015 and is projected to double by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050. China is now the leading plastics \nproducer responsible for 28 per cent of global production, the rest of Asia produces 21 per cent, the USA, \nCanada and Mexico together about 19 per cent and Europe 18 per cent and the rest of the world 14 per \ncent (Barra et al., 2018). \n\nPlastics are a family of hundreds of different materials, which can be either fossil fuel based or biobased, with a wide variety of properties and uses. The European plastics industry is made up of about \n60,000 companies with a turnover in 2017 close to EUR 355 billion and providing direct employment to \nmore than 1.5 million people.  \n\nAbout 64 million tonnes of plastic were produced in the EU, Norway and Switzerland in 2017 (Plastic \nEurope, 2018a). In the same year, the total demand for plastics in the EU, Norway and Switzerland \namounted to about 51 million tonnes (Table 2.1).  \n \nTable 2.1. Plastics demand in the EU, Norway and Switzerland, by sector, 2017, per cent \n \n\nSector Per cent \n\nPackaging  39.7  \n\nBuilding and construction  19.8  \n\nAutomotive 10.1  \n\nElectrical and electronic 6.2  \n\nHousehold, leisure and sports 4.1  \n\nAgriculture 3.4  \n\nOthers 16.7  \n\nSource: Plastic Europe, 2018a  \n\nSingle-use plastic food packaging, which is difficult to recycle because it is made of multiple materials, \nmakes up a large part of the plastic used for packaging (Schweitzer et al., 2018).   \n\nIt is estimated that the total amount of plastic ever produced is around 8,300 million tonnes of which \nabout 70 per cent is now waste (Geyer et al., 2017) and due to mismanagement around a third of that is \nestimated to have entered the environment as land, freshwater or marine pollution2. The World Wilde \nFund for Nature (WWF) estimates that, despite increasing efforts to improve the collection and \ntreatment, as much as 37 per cent of global plastic waste is currently managed ineffectively. Most \nplastics do not biodegrade, which means that if they leak into the environment they remain there for \nhundreds of years (WWF, 2019). \n\n                                                           \n2 Mismanaged plastic waste refers to plastic left uncollected, dumped, littered, or managed through uncontrolled \nlandfills, and it is much more likely to become pollution than waste managed through a controlled waste treatment \nfacility. \n\f\n \n\n5 \n \n\nFigure 2.1. Global primary generation of waste plastics, 1950\u20132015 \n\n \n\nKeys: PP&A = polyphthalamide; PUR = polyurethane; PET = polyethylene terephthalate; PVC = Polyvinyl chloride; PS = polystyrene; \nPP = polypropylene; HDPE = high-density polyethylene; LD/LDPE = low-density polyethylene \n\nSource: WWF, 2019 \n\nIn 2016, 27.1 million tonnes of plastic waste were collected in the EU and sent for energy recovery, 41.6 \nper cent; recycling, 31.1 per cent; and landfilling, 27.3 per cent. Between 2006 and 2016, the volume of \nplastic waste collected increased by 11 per cent and, with regard to waste management operations, \nrecycling and energy recovery increased by 79 and 61 per cent respectively, while landfilling decreased \nby 43 per cent (Plastic Europe, 2018a). \n\nA significant share of waste plastic is exported to non- EU countries. Indeed, these totalled around 3.1 \nmillion tonnes in 2016, almost 39 per cent of the figure for its recycling in the EU \u2013 around 8 million \ntonnes in 20163. This makes plastic waste different, for example, from glass waste, for which traded \nvolumes are small as compared to recycling volumes and trade flows are mostly within the EU4. On the \nother hand, plastic waste is closer to paper and cardboard waste, which also features significant extra-EU \nexports: in 2016, paper and cardboard waste recycling amounted to around 36.4 million tonnes, while \nextra-EU exports were around 11.6 million tonnes5. \n\n                                                           \n3 The trade figures are from Eurostat statistics for international trade in goods \n(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/data/database). The amount of extra-EU trade in \nwaste plastics is calculated using HS code 3915 \u2013 Waste, parings and scrap of plastics. Data for recycling was \nobtained using data for plastic waste and selecting Recovery-recycling from the Eurostat database on Treatment of \nwaste by waste category, hazardousness and waste management operations \n(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/env_wastrt) (accessed 27 May 2019). \n4 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statisticsexplained/index.php?title=Recycling_%E2%80%93_secondary_material_price_indicator#Price_and_trade_volumes. \n5 The trade figures are from Eurostat statistics for international trade in goods \n(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/data/database). The amount of trade in waste paper \nand paperboard to non-EU countries is calculated using HS code 4707 \u2013 Recovered (waste and scrap) paper or \npaperboard.

The share of packaging in plastic waste generation is \nconsiderably higher than in plastic demand. This may be due to the shorter average life time of \npackaging compared to other applications such as electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) or cars and \nthe fact that separate collection systems and the statistics may be more complete for waste plastic \npackaging than for other plastic waste types  6. \n\nFigure 2.2. Plastics demand and plastics waste generation in the EU by sector, per cent \n\n \n\n Source: Plastic Recyclers Europe, 2016 \n\nAccording to Material Economics (2018), only about 20 per cent of the plastic waste collected for \nrecycling in Europe actually ends up as recycled plastic, and the market of recycled plastics covers 10 per \ncent of the demand for plastics (Figure 2.3). Furthermore, the majority of recycled plastic ends up in \nlower-value applications such as flowerpots and buckets. The combination of high recycling costs, the \nlow quality of recycled material and a lack of quality standards has resulted in a limited demand for \nsecondary plastics. An improvement in the quality of the recycled plastics could considerably increase \ndemand by enabling new application areas (Material Economics, 2018). \n\n                                                           \nRecovery-recycling from Eurostat database on Treatment of waste by waste category, hazardousness and waste \nmanagement operations (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/env_wastrt) (accessed 27 May 2019).  \n6 According to Bio Intelligence Service (2011), plastic products in the construction sector are designed to be durable \nand can last between 30 and 40 years before being disposed of; electrical and electronic devices have on average a \nservice life of 3\u201312 years, with larger objects having a longer service life.

From waste plastics collected in Europe to recycled plastics, 2015, million \ntonnes \n\n \n\nSource: Material Economics, 2018 \n\nAccording to Plastic Recyclers Europe (2016), packaging is the biggest source of plastic waste in Europe, \n63 per cent; followed by building and construction, 6 per cent; EEE, 5 per cent; end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), \n5 per cent; and agriculture, 5 per cent. In 2016, the EU generated 16.3 million tonnes of plastic packaging \nwaste, of which 74.3 per cent were recovered and 42.4 per cent recycled7. \n\nFigure 2.4 Plastic packaging recycling and recovery in the EU, 2007\u20132016, per cent 8 \n\n \n\nSource: Eurostat website9 \n\n                                                           \n7 Eurostat Environment, Waste, Waste streams, Packaging waste by waste management operations and waste flow \n(env_waspac (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database). \n8 According to Eurostat \u2018The weight of recovered or recycled packaging waste shall be the input of packaging waste \nto an effective recovery or recycling process. If the output of a sorting plant is sent to effective recycling or recovery \nprocesses without significant losses, it is acceptable to consider this output to be the weight of recovered or \nrecycled packaging waste\u2019. Recovery includes recycling.  \n9 Eurostat Environment, Waste, Waste streams, Packaging waste by waste management operations and waste flow \n(env_waspac) ((http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database). \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nt\n\nPlastic packaging waste recycling Plastic packaging waste recovery\n\f\n \n\n8 \n \n\nThe EU\u2019s Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (PPWD) binding recycling target for plastics packaging \nwaste, 50 per cent by 2025 and 55 per cent by 2030, implies that more than an additional 10 million \ntonnes of recycled material need to be absorbed by the markets. Compared to 2014, this corresponds to \nmore than twice the amount of the total currently recycled material (Deloitte Sustainability, 2018).  \n\nSome European countries already recycle 50 per cent or more of their plastics packaging waste. \nCurrently, in 2019, however, the EU\u2019s recycling rates are calculated as the waste collected for recycling \nincluding waste exported for recycling. It is not always clear what happens to the exported waste and \nwhether the conditions of recycling meet the standards set by the EU. Furthermore, all the collected \nwaste is counted as recycled, even though there are always some material losses in the sorting and \nrecycling processes and, in many cases, some of the waste entering the sorting site is incinerated due to \nthe poor quality, or contamination of the waste.  \n\nChanges in the calculation methods were introduced by the EU in 2018 (EU, 2018), with the recycling \nrate calculated on the basis of the amount of waste plastics that enters a recycling facility and not on the \namount of waste plastics collected and sent for recycling (Member States shall transpose the Directive by \n5 July 2020). This calculation method will necessitate the waste collector being more aware of what \nhappens to the waste after collection. It is also likely to reduce the recycling rates as the collected \namount is always higher than the amount that actually enters the recycling facility as it does not include \nrejects from sorting. \n\nAt the global level, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2017), 95 per cent of the material \nvalue of plastic packaging, USD 80\u2013120 billion annually, is lost to the economy after a first use (one \ncycle). Globally, 40 per cent of plastic packaging waste is landfilled, 32 per cent escapes all waste \nmanagement and leaks into the wider environment, 14 per cent is incinerated and just 14 per cent is \ncollected for recycling. When additional value losses in sorting and reprocessing are taken into account, \nonly 5 per cent of the original material value is retained for a subsequent use.   \n\nAll products that contain plastics potentially contribute to the volume of plastic waste. The average \ncontent of plastics in European cars has increased from around 9 per cent of a vehicle\u2019s weight at the \nend of the 1990s (Kanari and Shallari, 2003) to 16 per cent in 2016 (CBI Market Intelligence, 2016). In \n2016, the EU generated 6.4 million tonnes of ELVs10, so assuming an average service life of about 10 \nyears and applying a share of plastic content of 10 per cent, it can be roughly estimated that, in 2016, at \nleast 645,000 tonnes of plastic waste were generated from ELVs.  \n\nThe composition of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) depends on the type of appliance. \nBuekens and Yang (2014) have estimated that average plastic concentration in large and small household \nappliances is 9 and 48 per cent respectively. When applying these shares to the amount of WEEE \ncollected in the EU in 2015, about 180,000 tonnes and 181,000 tonnes of plastic waste was generated, \nrespectively, from discarded large and small household appliances.  \n\n2.2. Plastics waste trade of EU countries \n\nExports of waste plastics, from both the EU and other regions/countries, increased significantly in recent \nyears. In 2016, 4 per cent of global plastic waste was exported, amounting to roughly 13 million tonnes, \nof which nearly 50 per cent originated in G7 countries11. Brooks et al. (2018) report that 89 per cent of \nhistorical global plastic waste exports consist of polymer groups often used in single use plastic food \npackaging (polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate) and, based on the UN \n\n                                                           \n10 Eurostat Environment, Waste, Waste streams, End-of-life vehicles by waste management operations \u2013 detailed \ndata (env_waselv) (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database):. \n11 G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n\f\n \n\n9 \n \n\nComtrade Database, they estimated that, in 1998\u20132016, the EU was responsible for 31 per cent of global \nplastic waste exports. \n\nIn spite of growth in domestic recycling and recovery capacity, about half the plastic waste collected in \nthe EU is sent abroad for treatment (EC, 2018a). More than 85 per cent of this was, until recently, \nshipped to China (EC, 2018a), which, since the 1990s, had been the main importer of plastic waste. Ships \ncarrying the huge volumes of consumer goods imported from Asia facilitated the export of EU waste \nback to Asia but this suddenly changed when China, and subsequently other destination countries, \nprogressively introduced rigid waste import policies culminating in bans on imports in 2018.  \n\nThis section presents the analysis of EU countries\u2019 trade in waste plastics based on Eurostat data on \ninternational trade in goods12. The data were extracted from the Eurostat database13 and specifically the \ndatasets on EU trade since 1988 by HS2-HS4 (DS-016894) and CN8 (DS-016890), depending on the \ninformation needed14.  \n\n2.3. Changing trends \n\nTotal exports of waste plastic increased steadily from 2000 to 2010, then fell until 2013 and again in \n2017\u20132018 (Figure 2.5). Trade to China changed from almost zero in 2000 to slightly more than 1 million \ntonnes in 2017, but returned to very low levels in 2018. In recent years China moved towards a ban on \nthe import of waste plastic, which became effective in January 2018 (Section 4.2). The recent decrease in \nextra-EU exports started even earlier, from 2014, while exports between EU Member States (intra-EU) \nshows a significant increase between 2000 and 2018, from 0.6 to around 2.5 million tonnes. As a result \nof these changes, intra-EU exports of waste plastic are now greater than extra-EU exports.  \n\nImport of waste plastics is largely an intra-EU flow. This trade increased steadily between 2000 and 2016, \nsince when it has remained more or less constant (Figure 2.6)15.  \n\nThe evidence from Figures 2.5 and 2.6 indicates that the Chinese trade ban has contributed to a \nreduction in total extra-EU exported quantities of plastic waste while the intra-EU trade has remained \nclose to stable. This suggests that at least part of the previously exported waste is now being retained for \nmanagement within the producing EU countries. \n\n                                                           \n12 Based on the Waste Shipment Regulation, Eurostat provides data on the transboundary shipment of plastic \nwaste for 2001\u20132018. These data, however, are not used in this report for the following reasons. First, within this \ndata set, only notified shipments are reported, i.e. mainly shipments of waste destined for disposal and of \nhazardous waste destined for recovery, excluding most of the trade in plastic waste, which mainly includes nonhazardous waste destined for recovery. Moreover, waste classification codes that are used in notification \ndocuments, and which are correspondingly reported by Eurostat, are very generic. The Basel Convention lists 47 Ycodes, 45 of which cover hazardous waste. Non-hazardous waste is addressed only by Y-46 Waste collected from \nhouseholds and Y-47 Residues arising from the incineration of household wastes. The inclusion of the European \nWaste Catalogue codes, which could provide for a better identification of shipped types of plastic waste , is \noptional and the related code field is often unfilled or unknown. \n13 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/data/database \n14 In Figures 2.5, 2.6 and 2.9 we refer to HS4 code 3915 - Waste, parings and scrap of plastics. More specific codes \nwill be highlighted where needed (Figures 2.7 and 2.8). \n15 Imports from China are not shown separately as the related share is small. \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/data/database\f\n \n\n10 \n \n\nFigure 2.5.

Changing destinations \n\nFigure 2.9 provides a detailed picture of EU exports to key extra-EU destinations17.  In line with data \nreported in Figure 2.5, a significant reduction in extra-EU exports of plastic waste took place between \nJanuary 2017 and April 2019. Furthermore, extra-EU exports have been redistributed significantly across \ncountries. The volumes of plastic waste exported to China and Hong Kong in 2018, for example, were, \nrespectively, 96 and 73 per cent lower than in 2015, while the opposite occurred in other countries, with \nTurkey and Indonesia recording the most significant increases, +1,295 and +485 per cent respectively. \nThe January 2018 Chinese ban, together with others or similar policies announced or introduced during \n2018 in other countries18, suggest a possible explanation of these changes, although in some cases it may \nstill be too early to observe an impact. \n\nFigure 2.9.

Illegal plastic waste trade \n\nIllegal shipments of plastic waste are likely to cause severe pressures on the environment. Plastic waste \nmay be exported to non-EU countries for the purpose of disposal and hazardous plastic waste to nonOECD countries for the purpose of recovery both in breach of the WSR. It is worth noting that, since plastics \nare often mixed with hazardous waste to disguise illegal shipments of the latter, they can be contaminated. \nMoreover, hazardous waste containing plastic, such as ELVs and some WEEE, may be exported for recovery \nto non-OECD countries also in violation of the WSR. Finally, plastic waste may be illegally exported for \nrecovery to non-OECD countries that have prohibited its import or in breach of the control procedure \napplied by the importing country (Section 4.1 and 4.2). \n\nData on illegal shipments of waste is provided by European Union Network for the Implementation and \nEnforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL) under the Enforcement Actions (EA) Project. This has been \nregularly used since 2008 to carry out inspections aimed at enforcing the WSR and analysing the related \ndata.  \n\nWith regard to EA Project III (2012\u20132013), EA Project IV (2014\u20132015), and EA Project V (2016\u20132017), Figure \n2.10 shows the share of transport and company violations19 related to plastics, WEEE and ELVs/car parts \n(IMPEL, 2018; 2016; 2013). It has to be underlined that each EA Project is characterised by a different \nnumber of administrative and transport inspections and of participating countries20.  \n\n                                                           \n \n \n19 The focus of the EA Projects was on transport inspections. Company inspections were introduced for verification \npurposes and for authorities that have limited opportunities to carry out transport inspections or where company \ninspections are a more effective tool for particular waste streams. \n20 EA III (2012-2013): 11,890 administrative and 10,524 physical transport inspections; 30 participating countries, 24 \nof which have reported inspection activities. EA IV (2014-2015): 4,787 administrative and 12,396 physical transport \ninspections; 31 participating countries, 26 of which reported inspection activities. EA V (2016-2017): 6,048 \nadministrative and 16,222 physical transport inspections; 34 participating countries, 27 of which reported \ninspection activities. Please note that administrative inspections consist purely of a review of the paperwork \nassociated with import/export traffic, for example, a review of port manifest documents to highlight shipments for \nfurther inspection, while physical inspections included a visual inspection of the consignment usually at a roadside \nlocation or a seaport if recorded as a transport inspection. They, however, could also take place at a known waste \nexport site or reprocessing facility. \n\f\n \n\n14 \n \n\nFigure 2.10. Violations by selected waste stream under IMPEL EA III, EA IV and EA V, per \ncent of violations  \n\n \n\nSource: own elaboration on data from IMPEL, 2018, 2016 and 2013 \n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the major waste streams involved in transport violations were metals, 20 per cent; ELVs \nand car parts 14 per cent; paper and cardboard, 10 per cent; WEEE 10 per cent and plastics, 8 per cent. \nThe major waste streams involved in company violations were household and mixed municipal waste, 23 \nper cent; WEEE, 18 per cent and plastics, 16 per cent.  \n\nIn June 2017, Interpol conducted Operation 30 Days of Action, the largest law enforcement operation \never mounted against waste crime, targeting illegal landfill activities and illegal shipments of all types of \nwaste and involving 43 countries from every region of the world. According to the operational findings \n(INTERPOL, 2017), Europe had most cases of illegal waste shipments (77 per cent) originating in the \nregion. In particular, 68 per cent of all criminal cases involving inter-regional shipments consisted of \nexports from Europe to Africa. Waste types detected were essentially WEEE falsely declared as used \nelectrical goods (43 per cent) and waste from the car industry (32 per cent), which mostly included used \ntyres (20 per cent), vehicle components and oil or a mixture of both WEEE and tyres.  \n\nThe two main waste streams illegally exported from Europe to Asia were paper and cardboard, and \nmetals, with plastics, WEEE and ELVs playing a minor role.  \n\nEurope was also the region from which most intra-regional and domestic illicit trade took place. These \nfindings, however, should be analysed bearing in mind that more than 50 per cent of countries \nparticipating in the operation were European with consolidated waste-crime related legislation and law \nenforcement capacity (INTERPOL, 2017).   \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nTransport Company\n\nPe\nr c\n\nen\nt \n\nPlastic\n\nEA III (2012-2013) EA IV (2014-2015)\n\nEA V (2016-2017)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nTransport Company\n\nPe\nr c\n\nen\nt\n\nWEEE\n\nEA III (2012-2013) EA IV (2014-2015)\n\nEA V (2016-2017)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nTransport Company\n\nPe\nr c\n\nen\nt\n\nELVs and car parts\n\nEA III (2012-2013) EA IV (2014-2015)\n\nEA V (2016-2017)\n\f\n \n\n15 \n \n\nOther information on illegal shipments of WEEE and ELVs comes from literature and reports. With regard \nto WEEE, according to Huisman et al. (2015), only 35 per cent (3.3 million tonnes) of all WEEE discarded in \n2012 in the EU ended up in official collection and recycling systems, while 1.3 million tonnes were shipped \nas undocumented exports beyond the EU. In general, small scale exports are destined to West Africa, while \nlarger and more structurally organised transport went to Southeast Asia, although China had introduced \nan import ban on all WEEE in 2000 (Palmeira et al., 2018; EFFACE, 2015).  \n\nFurthermore, it has been estimated that, on average, 25 per cent of all ELVs in the EU do not end up in \nauthorised treatment facilities (European Commission, 2014). The 2017 Assessment of the \nimplementation of the ELV Directive (European Commission, 2017) shows a significant increase in the \nnumber of unknown whereabouts21 in the EU, from 3.4 million vehicles in 2009 to 4.66 million vehicles in \n2014. Some of these vehicles were illegally exported to non-OECD countries (European Commission 2017).  \n\nThe effectiveness of the EU WSR depends on several factors, such as inspection capacity, which requires \nwell-trained staff, adequate financial resources and technical equipment; co-operation between \nenforcement authorities within and beyond national borders \u2013 customs, police services, environmental \nagencies, etc.; the extent to which environmental crimes are prosecuted and infringements penalised in \ntrading countries, etc. The revised WSR (EU, 2014) provides for stronger national inspection of waste \nshipments, including at the final destination.  \n\nSince not all trading countries have the same level of monitoring/enforcement, some illegal waste \ntraders engage in port-hopping, choosing those ports where the import and/or export controls are \nweakest. \n\nThe illegal trade provides substantial profits, while the risk of fines or imprisonment is generally low. The \ntrade is usually outsourced to small organised crime groups, typically of up to 10 people, which operate \nfor a short period, take the profits and then rapidly dissolve to form new groups. Corruption of border \nguards, customs, officials and port operators is often used (Palmeira et al., 2018). Legal \nactivities/businesses, such as banks, hauliers and lawyers, are also frequently, whether intentionally or \nnot, involved, making the export chain long and complex (EFFACE, 2017).  \n\nThe main method used to breach customs systems is to mingle illegal and legal waste to obtain a false \nclassification \u2013 trade the mixture using the HS code of the legal material. Enforcement is complicated by \nthe broad definitions of waste applied in the EU \u2013 for instance, the Waste Framework Directive Article 3 \n(EU, 2008) often makes the decision of whether a product is second hand or simply waste arbitrary22 \u2013 \nand by the existence of different code systems \u2013 WSR codes/Basel codes and HS codes used by custom \nauthorities.  \n\nBased on the above considerations, unless inspections and enforcement are regularly implemented \ntrade bans will probably not succeed in stopping the targeted waste flows. \n\n                                                           \n21 Unknown whereabouts are vehicles that are deregistered without a certificate of destruction being issued or \navailable to the authorities and also with no information available indicating whether the vehicle has been treated \nin an authorised facility or has been exported. \n22 However, the revised WSR has shifted the burden of proof regarding the distinction between waste and products \nas well as the environmentally sound management in third countries to suspected illegal exporters. A similar \nprovision has been introduced in the recast WEEE Directive (2012/19/EU). \n\f\n \n\n16 \n \n\n3 Drivers and pressures of the trade in waste plastics \n\n3.1. Drivers of trade in waste plastics \n\nDrivers of the waste trade can be described by following the existing empirical literature that \naddresses the determinants of the trade (Mazzanti and Zoboli 2013; EEA 2012; Kellenberg 2012). \nThese drivers also apply to the trade in waste plastic. A large part of the drivers identified in research \nand reporting are not regularly documented, however, and the empirical measurement of the role of \ndifferent drivers, including those for the trade in waste plastic, can be challenging outside specific \nstudies.  \n\nIn the framework provided by Kellenberg (2012), domestic waste is generated by consumption and \nproduction, on the basis, among other things, of countries\u2019 economic structures. Waste is then \nrecycled, disposed of domestically or exported. Relevant factors that determine waste exports include \ndomestic and foreign waste policies, infrastructure and traditional trade drivers. \n\nBased on literature and studies, Mazzanti and Zoboli (2013) propose a more detailed set of drivers. \n\n1. Gate fees and transportation costs. For a specific waste and a given management option such as \nenergy recovery, if there is enough management/treatment capacity in both the home and \ndestination countries, a driver of the waste trade can be the difference between the domestic \nand foreign gate fees, excluding environmental taxes, or between domestic and foreign prices, if \nthe price for the waste is positive. The gate fee differential must be weighed against transport \ncosts because, to justify the export, the advantage (cost saving or benefit) in gate fees (or prices) \nabroad must be higher than the additional transport costs. When considering transport costs, it \nmust be noted that some waste management locations, such as northern Italian regions, can be \ncloser to foreign countries than certain home country destinations, southern Italy, for example. \nFor long-distance transport costs, the working of the freight market must be considered, in \nparticular return-freight costs may be very low as an alternative to return travel without a load. \nReturn-freights costs may favour international shipment of non-hazardous waste or some waste \ncategories such as plastics waste that do not require specialist transport facilities. Another factor \nis the availability of international harbours, such as in the Netherlands, which may explain the \nconcentration of waste shipments and transits in some countries.  \n \n\n2. Administrative costs. Administrative costs must be added to the transport cost and they may \nreduce the profitability of international shipments. Specific administrative costs, notification fees \nfor compliance to regulations, for example, must be added for some waste flows. For hazardous \nwaste, these costs may be high compared to gate fee/price differential and may discourage legal \ninternational shipments.  \n \n\n3. Tariff and non-tariff barriers. For extra-EU destinations, there may be trade tariffs on waste in \nimporting countries that may discourage the waste trade. For certain categories of waste there \nmay be non-tariff customs measures or bans that may increase the costs of international \nshipment or even prevent it. This may explain changes in geography of trade if destination \ncountries impose different tariff rates or non-tariff barriers.  \n\n \n4. Differences in environmental taxes and policy stringency. Different countries may apply different \n\nenvironmental taxes, for instance on landfill or incineration, on the same management/treatment \nof the same waste type. This may stimulate shipments out from high-tax countries. Different \nimplementation of other economic instruments and (voluntary) environmental management \nsystems can also contribute to push trade flows. In transitional phases of the regulatory process, \n\f\n \n\n17 \n \n\ndifferent maturity in the implementation of rules, even between EU countries, can explain waste \nbeing shipped for disposal.  \n\n \n5. Differences in treatment capacities between countries (excess supply/demand)). There may be a \n\nsaturation of capacity for a given technology such as landfill at a reasonable distance within the \nhome country. The consequent excess supply of waste requiring management may drive export \nflows. In some critical situations, institutional failures and lack of diversification in (technological) \noptions can play a role. In this case, trade can be a necessary but not always the least-cost \nsolution because trade is efficient only if its cost is lower than the least-cost mix of waste \nmanagement at the local level. The capacity factors can also push demand to import waste. For \nexample, large waste-to-energy capacities in a country in which recycling is increasing may push \nprocurement of waste as an energy feedstock from others. In the capacity-differential discussion, \ndynamic considerations may be relevant: short-term benefits of trading could delay investment in \ndomestic capacity; as a consequence, trade can be beneficial in the short run but may induce \ndependence on foreign capacity. The transition from landfill disposal to recycling/recovery starts \nwith domestic policies on separate collection, which may face a short-term lack of \nrecycling/recovery capacity in the home country and then trade can prevail if there is enough \ncapacity (in excess of domestic supply) in other countries. Imbalances between domestic supply \nand domestic demand capacity, as well as for different technologies, may occur asymmetrically \nbetween countries and can change dynamically over time. The gradual creation of domestic \ncapacity can reduce trade flows and/or can change the quality, composition and destination of \ntrade. The increase in transboundary shipments of waste, therefore, is driven partly, but \nhopefully temporarily, by the introduction of recycling/recovery requirements and targets.  \n \n\n6. Different incentives for recycling/ energy recovery. For waste suitable for energy recovery, energy \npolicies may indirectly stimulate waste trade. For example, the incentives on renewable energy \nsources (RES), which include waste as a feedstock, are still high in some EU Member States \ncompared to others and non-EU countries. This may attract international procurement (import) \nof waste for energy. \n\n \n7. Differences in legislation/classification. Differences in legislation or administrative practice for \n\nwaste classification and treatment across countries could create incentives to ship waste \ninternationally. These costs can be compared to others \u2013 gate fees, transport, taxes/incentives, \nadministrative and customs costs \u2013 to determine whether the trade in waste is profitable.  \n\n \n8. Need for specific technologies. For some waste categories, for example some hazardous waste, \n\nthere may be limited capacity for treatment according to legislation in the home country. This \nmay drive international flows to where the technology is in operation, even over long distances \nand at high transport and administrative costs.  \n\n \n9. Geographical characteristics of countries/regions. Although they may be proxied by some of the \n\ndrivers discussed above, especially transport costs, the geographical characteristics of \ncountries/regions may be relevant drivers of waste trade. These are also easier to define than \ntransport costs and may be used as proxies for the latter in empirical analyses.  \n\nTable 3.1 summarises these drivers and possible empirical indicators. Most of the indicators, and the \ncorresponding drivers, are poorly documented in official statistics, and require information that can be \nscant or fragmented, or may require direct enquiries.  \n\nNonetheless, the trends and factors described in previous chapters suggest what can be the most \nimportant factors behind European countries\u2019 international trade in waste plastics. These factors are \nshown in the last two columns of Table 3.1 for, respectively, intra- and extra-EU trade.  \n\f\n \n\n18 \n \n\nThe combination of gate-fee differentials and transport cost can be relevant for extra-EU export of \nwaste plastics, in particular gate fees given the possible low transport costs by sea to Asia, whereas \nhigh overland transport costs may discourage intra-EU trade. The existence of bans can be a very \nrelevant factor in discouraging extra-EU trade. Different landfill taxes, when different from gate fees, \ncan be relevant for both intra- and extra-EU trade. Differences in domestic capacity for treatment and \nrecycling/recovery with respect to domestic collection capacity can be a very relevant factor behind \nboth intra- and extra-EU trade in waste plastics, probably the most important one in pushing trade as \na result of the rapid development of separate collection in most EU Member States not being matched \nby an equivalent increase of recycling capacity. While differences in classifications, legislation and, \nmore importantly, different administrative practices across EU Member States cannot be excluded as \na factor stimulating plastics waste trade, this can be much more important in pushing the extra-EU \ntrade. Finally, both the need of specific technologies or the availability of different technologies giving \neconomic value to waste plastics, as well as the closeness of countries and lower transport costs can \nbe factors mainly behind intra-EU trade in waste plastics.   \n\nTable 3.1.

Environmental and climate pressure in plastics\u2019 lifecycle  \n\na) Source materials \n\nThe production of plastic is largely reliant on fossil hydrocarbons. In Europe, 49 million tonnes of oil \nand gas were used for the production of plastics in 2015, about 6 per cent of the total amount used \n(Kaiser et al., 2018). This is equivalent to the oil consumption of the global aviation sector.  \n\nIf the growth in plastic production continues as expected, the plastics sector will account for 20 per \ncent of total oil consumption and 15 per cent of the global annual carbon budget by 205023.  \n\nIncineration and energy recovery also result in a direct release of carbon (not taking account of the \npotential carbon savings of replacing it with another source of energy). If the plastics are landfilled, \nthis feedstock carbon could be considered sequestered. If it is leaked, carbon might be released into \nthe atmosphere. Even though plastics can bring resource efficiency gains during use, these figures \nshow that it is crucial to address the greenhouse gas impact of plastic production and after-use (Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation, 2017).  \n\n                                                           \n23 The budget that must be adhered to if global warming is to be limited to less than 2\u00b0 C above pre-industrial \nlevels \n  \n\f\n \n\n20 \n \n\nFigure 3.1. The different stages of the plastic lifecycle \n\n \n\nSource: UNEP, 2018 \n\nb) Product manufacture \n\nOne of the greatest technological challenges in increasing the recycling of plastics is the complexity of \nthe materials in the market. Multilayer structures, the large selection of resins and the use of a variety \nof additives in the plastic materials create difficulties in waste sorting and refining. Few plastic \npackaging materials and products are designed to be easily recyclable. The Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation has estimated that without fundamental redesign and innovation, about 30 per cent of \nplastic packaging will never be reused or recycled. It is therefore of crucial importance that more \nattention is paid to end-of-life options from the initial design stages of materials and products (Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation, 2017).  \n\nThe raw materials of plastics are delivered to plastics converters in the form of small plastic pellets. \nThese typically have a diameter of 2\u20135 millimetres (mm) and are regular in shape. Smaller powders, \noften referred to as fluff, are also produced and have more irregular shapes and sizes. Pellets are \ntransported from their production site by ship, train and/or truck to the facility where the final \nproducts are made. Some material can be lost at each stage of the production and transportation \nchain. Several studies indicate that, in many cases, pellets leak out of the system \u2013 plastic preproduction pellets have been found in environmental samples all over the world (Karlsson et al., \n2018). \n\nc) Use phase \n\nAbout half the plastics produced are used in products and packaging the life cycle of which is less than \nthree years. This, together with the lack of proper waste management in many developing countries, \nis the main cause of the leaking of plastics into the environment. \n\nTwo main issues, which can cause both environmental and health pressures in the use phase, are:  \ni) the release of secondary microplastics24; and ii) the release of additives (or monomers/oligomers).  \n\nIn addition to polymers (resins) almost all plastic materials contain variable amounts of other \nchemicals added to improve their processability and other properties. Several studies have highlighted \n                                                           \n24 Primary microplastics are plastics originally manufactured to be that size, while secondary microplastics \noriginate from fragmentation. \n\f\n \n\n21 \n \n\nthe likelihood of these additives contaminating air, food, soil and water (Hahladakis et al., 2018). Due \nto wearing, some break down into micro- (0.1\u20135 mm in length) and/or nano- (0.001\u20130.1mm in length) \nplastic particles, which are difficult to detect and remove from the air, oceans and soils. Microplastics \ncan contain, on average, 4 per cent of additives and can adsorb other contaminants. Both additives \nand contaminants can be organic as well inorganic; as most plastics do not biodegrade, the \nmicroplastic pollution stays in the environment for hundreds of years, and thus starts to accumulate. \nMicroplastics have already been found in, amongst others, common table salt, both tap and bottled \nwater and human manure25. \n\nThe impacts of microplastics in soils, sediments and freshwater are not known in detail. It is suggested \nthat they may have a long-term damaging effect on terrestrial ecosystems globally through adverse \neffects on organisms, such as soil-dwelling invertebrates and fungi, needed for ecosystem services and \nfunctions. Up to 730,000 tonnes of microplastics are transferred to agricultural lands in Europe and \nNorth America every year from urban sewage sludge used as farm manure. Furthermore, toxicity and \ntoxicokinetic data are lacking for a human risk assessment of both micro- and nanoplastics (Barra et al, \n2018)26. \n\nPlastics has become a serious challenge for the natural world. Wildlife entanglement has been \nrecorded in more than 270 different animal species, including mammals, reptiles, birds and fish. It is \nestimated that about a thousand marine turtles die every year from entanglement in plastic waste. \nStudies have shown that more than 240 different animal species have been ingesting plastic. These \nanimals are often unable to pass the plastic through their digestive systems, resulting in internal \nabrasions, digestive blockages and death. Toxins from ingested plastic have also been shown to harm \nbreeding and impair immune systems (WWF, 2019). \n\nd) End of life \n\nProper local waste management is a prerequisite for sustainable end of life of plastics. While some \nmismanagement of waste exists in many regions, it is greatest in low- and middle-income countries as \na result of inadequate waste management infrastructure. In 2016, more than 76 per cent of total \nplastic waste in low-income countries was mismanaged (WWF, 2019).  \n\nMismanaged plastic waste \u2013 plastic left uncollected, openly dumped, littered, or managed through \nuncontrolled landfills \u2013, is much more likely to become pollution than waste managed through a \ncontrolled treatment facility. The majority of mismanaged plastic waste is believed to have polluted \nland-based ecosystems, and 80 per cent of ocean plastics are estimated to come from land-based \nsources, rather than from such sources as cruise ships or fishing boats. On land, plastic can also leak \nfrom collection sites to the ocean, but it is much more likely to reach the ocean if it was never \ncollected formally in the first place. Mismanaged plastic waste has many negative impacts on the \nenvironment, human health and economies (Figure 3.2). \n\n                                                           \n25 See https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/07/microplastic-pollution-revealed-absolutelyeverywhere-by-new-research; https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/the-hills-are-alivewith-the-signs-of-plastic-even-swiss-mountains-are-polluted; \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/microplastics-found-in-human-stools-for-the-firsttime; The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM), 2016.  \n26 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/microplastics-found-in-human-stools-for-the-firsttime \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/07/microplastic-pollution-revealed-absolutely-everywhere-by-new-research\f\n \n\n22 \n \n\nFigure 3.2. Examples of impacts of mismanaged plastic waste  \n\n \nSource: UNEP, 2018 \n\nIn 2016, McKinsey and the non-profit Ocean Conservancy conducted a study according to which \nroughly 60 per cent of all the plastic in global waters originates in five countries: China, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Thailand and Viet Nam27. None of these five countries had a comprehensive formal \nrecycling system in 2016. Instead they had waste pickers, who root through garbage piles to find \nreusable items to sell for cash. Only about 20 per cent of discarded plastic is valuable enough to be of \ninterest to a waste picker, for example plastic bags are not collected \u2013 due to their light weight and \nballoon-like design, plastic bags are easily blown in the air, eventually ending up on land and/or the \nsea. Over the past two to three years China has made efforts to curb waste: in 2018, it ended imports \nof low quality foreign waste and in 2019 it has ordered 46 cities to begin sorting waste in order to \nachieve a 35 per cent recycling rate by 2020. \n\nAccording to a study by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (2018) in Germany28, 10 \nrivers in Asia and Africa carry 93 per cent of plastic trash into seas. These rivers are the Yangtze, \nYellow, Hai, Peral, Amur, Mekong, Indus and Ganges in Asia, and the Niger and Nile in Africa. The \nYangtze alone dumps 1.5 million tonnes of plastic waste into the Yellow Sea each year.  \n\nWith more than 150 million tonnes of plastic in the ocean, augmented each year by an estimated \nfurther 8 million tonnes, plastic pollution is a growing environmental problem worldwide \u2013 plastics \ntake longer to degrade in the sea than on land due to the lower temperatures and the presence of \nsalt. \n\n                                                           \n27 https://qz.com/595673/more-than-half-the-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-these-five-countries/ \n28 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/90-of-plastic-polluting-our-oceans-comes-from-just-10-rivers/ ; \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stemming-the-plastic-tide-10-rivers-contribute-most-of-the-plasticin-the-oceans/. \n\nhttps://qz.com/595673/more-than-half-the-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-these-five-countries/\f\n \n\n23 \n \n\nFigure 3.3. Overview of end-of-life options for plastics \n\n \nNotes: * We consider that all landfills on high income countries are controlled based World Bank data from the \u2018What a waste \n2.0\u2019 Report; ** Not accounting for plastic losses during the recovery process; *** Unless explicitly specified as \u2018controlled\u2019 or \n\u2018sanitary\u2019 landfills, we consider landfills in upper middle, lower middle and low income countries as uncontrolled or unspecified. \n\nSource: WWF, 2019, based on Dalberg analysis; Jambeck et al. (2015); World Bank (2018); SITRA (2018); \nEuropean Commisison (2001) \n\nd.i) Collection \n\nRecycling supply chains in most countries are often quite complicated. For example, materials may be \ncollected and sorted by contractors before being sold on to third parties. Collection systems are \nfragmented and much of the infrastructure is optimised to meet policy targets and not necessarily to \nthe actual production of high-quality secondary materials. Furthermore, the dismantling of end-of-life \nproducts, such as the demolition of buildings and ELVs, needs to be improved to obtain better quality \nwaste streams for further refining. \n\nUnder-developed waste management infrastructure is a major challenge in low- and middle-income \ncountries and leads to low collection rates. Low-income countries invest three times less in waste \nmanagement systems than high-income countries (WWF, 2019). \n\nd.ii) Incineration \n\nPlastics have a high caloric value and thus release a considerable amount of energy when incinerated. \nHowever, as many plastics are complicated mixtures of resins and additives, toxic emissions often \noccur during combustion due either to incomplete burning or the inherent behaviour of the \nconstituents. Incineration of plastics should, therefore, be carried out in controlled and professional \nwaste-to-energy plants equipped with suitable filters, etc.  \n\nA significant proportion of end-of-use plastics ends up in MSW. In many developing countries \ninadequate or informal waste management systems result in the waste usually being burned in open \ndumps or household backyards, often for heating and/or cooking purposes, exposing women and \nchildren particularly to significant toxic emissions. The open burning of plastics has several negative \neffects, for example it releases carbon dioxide and black carbon, often together with such other toxic \n\f\n \n\n24 \n \n\nair pollutants as furans and dioxins. The toxic particles released can also settle on crops or in \nwaterways, degrading water quality and entering the food chain. Furthermore, illegal disposal \npractices of plastics waste often take the form of open burning, accentuating the release of toxic \ngases. Poorly regulated incineration or the open burning of plastics waste have been shown to human \nheighten respiratory ailments, increase the risk of heart disease and damage the nervous system. \nCommunities living close to inadequately controlled waste management facilities are particularly at \nrisk. \n\nThe incineration capacity for waste plastics is projected to grow in developing countries, for example, \nby 7.5 per cent in Asia by 2023. In order to guarantee safe operation, attention has to paid to regional \nenvironmental regulations and incineration plant performance. For example, 78 per cent of China\u2019s \ncurrent waste-to-energy facilities fail to meet EU standards for dioxin emissions (WWF, 2019; UNEP, \n2018). \n\nd. iii) Recycling \n\nCurrently the recycling plastics is almost entirely carried out by a mechanical route that is suitable only \nfor homogenous and contaminant-free waste, which most of the plastic wastes are not. In general, \nmixed plastics waste will never be more than 60 per cent recyclable by mechanical means. This means \nthat 40 per cent of the waste entering plants has to be treated separately, which creates a risk of \nmismanagement in countries with poorly developed environmental legislation. Globally it is estimated \nthat only 9 per cent of the 6,300 million tonnes of plastic waste generated between 1950 and 2015 \nhas been recycled (Geyer, R. et al., 2017). \n\nWaste treatment of any kind needs careful risk management and special attention to issues including \nfire and occupational safety as well as emissions control. Examples exist of poorly managed plastics \nrecycling plants in Asian countries causing environmental and health risks (GAIA, 2019).   \n\nCurrently operating costs for recycling plastics are often high due to high collection and separation \ncosts and a limited supply of recyclable plastic. Collecting and sorting is a time consuming and labourintensive process, due to the high levels of mixed and contaminated plastic waste. Together, collecting \nand sorting constitute approximately 40 per cent of recycling costs. Securing of a supply of suitable \nplastics waste is one of the key elements of make recycling profitable but due to fragmented \ncollections systems, this can be an important bottleneck for business development.  \n\nThe focus of mechanical recycling has so far been on polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density \npolyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP) recycling. The price of virgin plastic is linked to the price \nof oil, which is highly volatile. This fundamentally influences the price that manufacturers are willing to \npay for recycled plastics. At the present, plastics recycling is in most cases down-cycling, which means \nthat the quality of the recycled plastic is less than that of the original material (Hundertmark et al., \n2018; Material Economics, 2018). \n\nChemical recycling can also play a role in developing a more circular economy for plastics, as it can \noffer pathways to achieve higher volumes and higher quality recycled materials. Chemical recycling of \nplastics, also known as tertiary recycling or feedstock recycling, means converting plastic waste into \nmonomers, other chemical raw materials or fuels with the help of catalysts, heat and/or pressure. \nChemical recycling encompasses a family of different technologies, but to fulfil their potential, most \nchemical recycling technologies still have to be further developed to ensure the reliable production of \nhigh-quality secondary raw materials in safe, sustainable and economically-feasible ways. \nFurthermore, building new infrastructure for waste handling and chemical processing would be \nneeded. New supply-chains also, including actors along the whole value cycle, will have to be \ndeveloped and new markets created for recyclates. Some of the supply chains are based on concepts \n\f\n \n\n25 \n \n\nin which the thermochemical conversion of plastic waste into pyrolysis oil takes place in plants near \nthe source of waste, thereby supporting local economies and job creation, and the oil then be shipped \nto centralised petrochemical sites for further refinement (De Smet 2019). Chemical recycling is still an \nemerging end-of-life option for plastics, and several technological and regulative challenges will have \nto be overcome before large scale utilisation can take place. \n\nd. iv) Landfill \n\nIt is estimated that more than 60 per cent of the plastic made since 1950 is in landfills and the wider \nenvironment (Geyer et al., 2017). If current consumption patterns and waste management practices \ndo not improve, by 2050, there will be about 12 billion tonnes of plastic in landfills and the natural \nenvironment. Furthermore, if the landfills are not well constructed, plastics will leak, polluting nearby \naquifers, water bodies and settlement (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). \n\nIn Europe, waste legislation of some countries introduced bans the landfilling of organic waste, \nincluding plastics. This has created pressure on companies and municipalities to find new end-of-life \noptions for plastics. \n\nd. v) Mismanaged plastic waste \n\nIf plastics leak into the environment, the stay there for a long time \u2013 it can take hundreds of years for \nthem to be broken down. This harms biodiversity and damages the ability of ecosystem to deliver \nservices needed to support life. Plastic can enter the natural environment either in the form of litter, \nor micro- and nanoplastics. The main impacts of plastics in natural environment can be divided into 10 \ngroups. \n\ni) Release of harmful or toxic chemicals: some plastics contain toxic chemicals, including persistent \norganic pollutants (POPs), which have been linked to health issues including cancer as well as and \nmental, reproductive and development diseases. (WWF, 2019; Hahladakis et al., 2018) \n\nii) Spoilage of international waters: plastics pollution is prevalent in all the world\u2019s oceans. At the \nglobal level, it is estimated that 15\u201351 trillion plastic particles are floating on the surface of \noceans. In a business-as-usual scenario, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2017) estimates that \nthe ocean will contain 1 tonne of plastic for every 3 tonnes of fish by 2025 and more plastic than \nfish by 2050. \n\niii) Harming biodiversity: plastics pollution is the second most significant threat to the future of coral \nreefs after climate change. Wildlife entanglement has been recorded in more than 270 different \nanimal species, including mammals, reptiles, birds and fish, and more than 240 different animal \nspecies have been shown to have ingested plastic. High concentrations of plastic materials, \nparticularly plastic bags, have been found blocking the breathing passages and stomachs of \nhundreds of different species. Plastic bags in the ocean resemble jellyfish and are often ingested \nby turtles and dolphins who mistake them for food. It is estimated that a minimum of a thousand \nmarine turtles die every year due to entanglement in plastic waste, which includes lost or \ndiscarded fishing gear. There is emerging evidence that the toxic chemicals added during the \nmanufacturing processes transfer from the ingested plastic into the animals\u2019 tissues and \neventually enter the human food chain (WWF, 2019; UNEP, 2018). \n\niv) Land degradation and contamination of food systems: the emerging threat from microplastics to \nterrestrial ecosystems, especially agricultural soils, could lead to further land degradation \naffecting food production and contaminate of food products. \n\f\n \n\n26 \n \n\nv) Air pollution: much microplastic ends up in ocean, but some travels long distances through the air \nto remote area including Pyrenees mountains. The maximum distance microplastics can travel is \nstill unclear, but research has found that larger dust particles have travelled 3,500 kilometres \nacross the Atlantic Ocean (Allen et al., 2019). Flying insects (ontogenic transference) are also a \npossible pathway for the aerial dispersal of microplastics (Al-Jaibachi et al., 2018)29. \n\nvi) Hotspots for microbial activity: plastics and microplastics can create a micro-environment, within \nwhich microbial and chemical conditions differ significantly from surrounding water. Their \ninfluence on the transformation and composition of marine organic matter is still largely \nunknown, but some research results point to the possibility that marine microplastics act as \nlocalised hotspots of microbial activity, with the potential of influencing marine carbon dynamics. \nA research group in the National University of Singapore found more than 400 types of bacteria \non 275 pieces of microplastic collected from local beaches. The bacteria include those associated \nwith coral bleaching (Photobacterium rosenbergii) and those that cause wound infection (Vibrio) \nor gastroenteritis in humans (Arcobacter) (Curren and Leong, 2019; Galgani et al., 2018). \n\nvii) Possible health effects to humans from the ingestion of plastics: humans are highly likely to ingest \nmicro- and nanoplastics, but the direct health impacts are still unknown. Humans can ingest \nplastic by consuming foods contaminated with micro- and nanoplastics. This is most likely to \noccur through seafood, particularly shellfish, mussels and oysters, but there are many other \npotential sources of contamination. A recent study of bottled water found microplastic \ncontamination in 93 per cent of bottles, sourced from 11 different brands (EFSA, 2016). \n\nviii) Social and tourism impacts: plastics waste at the seaside creates visual pollution, which is \nincreasingly becoming an issue, especially in countries that rely heavily on tourism, such as Small \nIsland Developing States. For instance, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) estimated \nthe economic impact of marine plastics on the tourism, fishing and shipping industry as USD1.3 \nbillion per year (WWF, 2019; UNEP, 2018). \n\nix) Marine transport: commercial shipping vessels are extremely sensitive to collisions with plastic \npollution and damage to vessels could also endanger human lives. The Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC) estimated the annual cost of litter damage to commercial shipping as USD297 \nmillion (WWF, 2019).  \n\nx) Some mismanaged plastic waste such as plastic bags can choke waterways and intensify natural \ndisasters. In 1988, poor drainage resulting from plastic bags clogging drains contributed to floods \nin Bangladesh, causing several deaths. In developing countries with inadequate solid waste \nmanagement regulations, plastic bag litter can also raise the risk of the transmission of vectorborne diseases such as malaria by blocking sewage systems and providing breeding grounds for \nmosquitoes and other pests (WWF, 2019).  \n\nThe total economic impact of plastic pollution is not yet known. Most research so far has focused on \nthe impact on oceans. The UN Environment (UNEP) estimates the economic impact of ocean plastic \npollution at USD8 billion per year. It is also estimated that there is four times more plastic pollution on \nland than in the oceans, suggesting that the total economic impact of plastic pollution is actually much \ngreater (WWF, 2019).  \n\n                                                           \n29 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/microplastics-found-in-human-stools-for-the-firsttime \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/microplastics-found-in-human-stools-for-the-first-time\f\n \n\n27 \n \n\n3.3. Pressures from trading plastic waste and potential benefits of \u2018non-trading\u2019 \n\nGiven the pressures arising from the life-cycle of plastics, the consequences of traded waste plastics \ncan be seen from two perspectives: the economic and environmental costs and benefits of trading for \nimporting countries, and the possible economic and environmental costs and benefits of \u2018non-trading\u2019 \nfor exporting countries.  \n\nIn general, importing countries can enjoy economic benefits from the import and industrial processing \nof waste plastic while suffering environmental pressures, which in general are those described for \nlandfilling, recycling, incineration and waste mismanagement, together with those of domestic \nlogistics and transport. Exporting countries can avoid environmental pressures and economic costs if \ndomestic management options are not economically viable, but can lose potential economic benefits \nif appropriate costs and market conditions should prevail or could be created (Mazzanti and Zoboli \n2013).  \n\nWhile the trade of plastic waste has become widespread and significant, the closure of major export \nchannels will force European countries to consider the possible advantages of \u2018non-trading\u2019 \u2013 \nprocessing plastic waste domestically \u2013 not only from an economic point of view, but also from a \ngeneral environmental one, given that their technological opportunities are better than those in many \ndestination countries.   \n\nPressures from imports in Asian countries \n\nThe EU used to promote plastic recycling from a waste management perspective, preferring recycling \nto incineration and landfilling. But its success has mainly been in the first stage of the recycling value \nchain, that is collection, which is then followed by large export flows. China and other countries turned \nthe corresponding trade in plastic waste into an opportunity to boost their industrial growth, possibly \nat the expense of their social and environmental conditions (OECD, 2018). \n\nThe global rise of the export of plastic waste to China went hand-in-hand with increasing plastic \nproduction capacity and consumption of plastic products in China (Brooks and Jambeck 2018; ISWA, \n2014). Meanwhile, the plastic product manufacturing and reprocessing in China is shifting from a large \nnumber of small, unregistered facilities with no rules for operation, quality standards or inspections to \ninvestment in larger manufacturing plants, which are subject to increasing quality and environmental \ncontrols. \n\nChina\u2019s intention is to improve its domestic waste collection, in part also for environmental reasons, \nand, in the longer term, to rely mainly on its own recovered material collection. China\u2019s State Council \nintends to end all solid waste and scrap imports by the end of 2019 and replace them with domestic \nsources30.  \n\nAs a consequence of the Chinese ban, a group of other South-Asian countries including Malaysia and, \ninitially, Viet Nam are currently importing traded waste plastics in the hope to enjoying the economic \n\n                                                           \n30 Stephen Moore summarized it in Plastics Today: \u2018It is somewhat ironic that a developing economy in China, \nfacing numerous environmental challenges of its own including polluted waterways and air, has provided the \nimpetus for the global plastics industry to reconsider how it handles its waste. For too long, numerous developed \neconomies have been happy to push their plastic waste problems onto emerging economies in Asia without \nworrying about developing sustainable plastic recycling strategies. The days for such actions would appear to be \nlimited. No longer does any country want to import other countries\u2019 problems. It is time for the developed world \nto step up to the plate.\u2019 \n\f\n \n\n28 \n \n\nbenefits from it that China did31.. However, many of these countries are still in their infancies with \nrespect to the development of waste management plans to deal with their domestic waste in a \ncontrolled, sustainable way and are even struggling with shifting from dumping to landfilling and \nincineration. As these first steps on the waste hierarchy are an insurmountable condition to continue \nclimbing the hierarchy (Material Economics, 2018), it does not come as a surprise that these countries \ndo not seem to be organised to receive this imported waste to recycle, and its final sustainable \ndisposal is quite uncertain. \n\nFigure 3.4: Average waste treatment in different regions  \n\n \n\nSource:  Kaza et al., 2018  \n\nHistorical trends of waste management practices show that many low- and middle-income countries \noften import waste materials for recycling but have weak waste management infrastructure. \nTherefore, it is not unconceivable that considerable amounts of the waste sent for recycling will \nultimately be landfilled or dumped.  \n\nThe imported waste in some developing countries is often not processed according to EU standards \nand might even get dumped or burned in unregulated ways, although EU waste legislation lays down \nthat recovery operations of exported waste must take place under \u2018broadly equivalent conditions\u2019 to \nthose within the EU (Eunomia, 2018). Many actors in Southeast Asia profit from the inability of legal \noperators and the failure of authorities to cope with the increased imports, ignoring the local impact \non human health and the environment.  \n\nIn some countries, after legal import, plastic waste is often sorted into two grades: high-grade for \nrecycling, and low-grade for burning or landfilling. Nevertheless, part of the high-grade plastic still \nends up in dumps or being burned while recycling rates can drop as low as 30\u201340 per cent because of \npoor sorting (Greenpeace Malaysia, 2018). \n\nFor example, a field investigation by the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA, 2019) in \nAsia revealed illegal recycling operations, open burning, water contamination, crop death and a rise in \n\n                                                           \n31 National Geographic, (2018); China\u2019s ban on trash imports shifts waste crisis to Southeast Asia, \nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/china-ban-plastic-trash-imports-shifts-waste-crisissoutheast-asia-malaysia/ \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nSouth Asia\n\nEast Asia and Pacific\n\nEurope and Central Asia\n\n%\n\nOpen dump Landfill Composting Recycling Incineration\n\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/china-ban-plastic-trash-imports-shifts-waste-crisis-southeast-asia-malaysia/\f\n \n\n29 \n \n\nillness tied to environmental pollution that has led citizens to protest and governments to rush in \nrestrictions to protect their borders. \n\nIn addition to harming the natural ecosystems this also generates significant economic costs by \nreducing the productivity of vital natural systems and clogging urban infrastructure. According to the \nEllen Mac Arthur Foundation (2017), the after-use costs added together with greenhouse gas \nemissions from plastic packaging production are estimated to be approximately USD40 billion \nannually, which is more than the plastic-packaging industry profits. \n\nPotential benefits for Europe from \u2018non-trading\u2019 with non-EU countries \n\nThe presently traded volumes of European plastic waste could potentially provide substantial amounts \nof secondary material resources for European manufacturing. Additionally, recycling in the EU could \nalso provide a net benefit for the European economy, through the creation of additional jobs and \nadded value, and for the environment, through the development of extensive knowledge and \nexpertise in Europe in dealing with recycling in relation to human health and environmental standards.  \n\nCurrently much European waste plastic is traded because of limited or low-quality collected waste \nstreams, corresponding with the proportional cost of recycling them into a valuable secondary \nmaterial able to meet strict industry specifications (Letsrecycle, 2019) and a lack of domestic recycling \ncapacity.  \n\nA first necessary step to promote local recycling to produce high value secondary materials for which \nthere is a local market would be the further separation of plastic waste in line with the requirements \nof the corresponding sorting and recycling infrastructure, thereby providing higher quality feedstock \n(Letsrecycle, 2019; ISWA 2014). \n\nSince the Chinese ban, there is an oversupply of plastic waste in Europe and available European \nrecycling capacities are filling up. On the other hand, investment in new plastic recycling capacity has \nbeen held back by the sector\u2019s prospects of low profitability. Although some additional capacity is \nbeing built or is in the pipeline, the total recycling capacity still only represents a fraction of both the \ntotal plastic waste supply and of the demand for plastics. Therefore, there is definitely room for \nexpanding plastic recycling in Europe. \n\nInvestments in additional waste incineration capacity in Europe have been announced, but as this \nfocuses on residual waste, it should neither nullify nor diminish efforts to setting up additional plastic \nrecycling capacity in Europe. \n\nIt is also of crucial importance that European Member States stop exporting low-quality plastics to \ncountries which lack the infrastructure to safely handle this waste.  \n\f\n \n\n30 \n \n\nFigure 3.5. Measures suggested by Material Economics to transform the economics of \nthe plastics value chain  \nImpacts of the suggested measures are shown in the column on right \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Material Economics, 2018 \n\nIncreasing advanced plastic recycling can be seen as an important way of decreasing plastics leaking \ninto the environment. In the best scenarios, environmental benefits are coupled with economic ones. \nIt is estimated that a scale-up of high-quality recycling of plastic packaging could generate a benefit of \nUSD30\u201340 per tonne collected \u2013 USD0.3\u20130.5 billion in OECD (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).  \n\nA recent report released by the American Chemistry Council (2019) suggested that the potential \nannual economic impact of expanding advanced plastic recycling and recovery technologies in the \nUnited States would be nearly USD10 billion.  \n\nThe economics of plastics recycling is highly dependent on the price of oil. McKinsey has estimated \nthat by 2030 one third of plastics entering the global market could be manufactured from recycled \nplastics. This would need a considerable increase in mechanical recycling and in the use of \nthermochemical technologies to convert waste plastics to feedstock for the petrochemical industry \n(Hundertmark et al., 2018). The estimate is that this could be economically beneficial for both the \npetrochemical and plastics industries, assuming a USD75-a-barrel oil price and an effective regulatory \nframework reinforced by supportive behaviour from other industry stakeholders and consumers. Since \nthe beginning of the 21st century, oil prices have been subject to very significant volatility, and the \nunpredictable cost of fossil feedstock creates a risk for companies. The use of recycled and renewable \nfeedstock in plastics production could help reduce exposure to volatility of the price of (fossil-based) \nvirgin feedstock (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). \n\f\n \n\n31 \n \n\nAccording to WWF estimates, eliminating waste mismanagement and reusing plastic could create \nmore than a million jobs in plastic recycling and remanufacturing. Their no-plastics-in nature scenario \ncalls for developing capacity to recycle 60 per cent of global plastic waste, approximately 113 million \ntonnes annually (WWF, 2019). \n\nA recent report by Material Economics (2018) suggests that a range of measures to improve the \ncollection and processing of waste plastics is needed to transform the economics of the plastics value \nchain. Once a system which retains the value of the material is created, recycling plastics would \nbecome profitable and take off on a larger scale. Material Economics\u2019 analysis shows that this could be \nfeasible for all the large-volume plastics types which dominate the markets.  \n\f\n \n\n32 \n \n\n4 Evolving policies and regulations  \n\n4.1. EU legal framework on plastic waste trade \n\nThe shipment of waste within and beyond the EU is regulated by the WSR (Regulation EC No \n1013/2006; EU, 2006a). This Regulation stipulates, among other things, the following trade bans: 1) \nexports to non-EU countries of waste for disposal, except to EFTA countries that are party to the Basel \nConvention; 2) exports for recovery of hazardous waste, except those directed to countries to which \nthe OECD decision applies. The shipment of non-hazardous waste plastics for recovery to non-OECD \ncountries, is regulated by WSR Article 37, which stipulates that the European Commission has to send \na written request to each non-OECD country seeking confirmation in writing that non-hazardous waste \nmay be exported for recovery in that country and under which control procedure, if any. Most nonOECD countries have decided to ban the import of such waste or to allow it under specified control \nprocedures (Section 4.2). Moreover, all the parties involved in the shipment shall ensure that waste is \nmanaged in an environmentally sound manner, complying with EU and international rules.  \n\nEU Member States have developed different approaches for verifying that the recovery of exported \nwaste takes place in the importing country under \u2018broadly equivalent conditions\u2019 to those prescribed \nby EU legislation. The adequate implementation and enforcement of the Regulation, although \nchallenging, is crucial to avoiding illegal shipments and preventing harmful environmental effects. \n\nThe WSR transposes the Basel Convention into EU law. The Convention prohibits the export of \nhazardous waste unless the state of import has given its prior consent in writing to the specific import. \nOn June 2018, the government of Norway submitted a proposal to amend the Basel Convention, in \norder to extend the provision on prior consent to the shipment of plastic waste (IMPEL website). The \n14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention, in May 2019, decided to extend the prior consent \nregime to contaminated, mixed or hard-to-recycle plastic waste (Rethink Plastic website). Based on \nthis amendment, which will become effective in January 2021, the WSR will also require prior written \nnotification and consent when mixed/hard to recycle non-hazardous plastic waste is shipped for \nrecovery: \n1) within the EU \u2013 instead of general information requirements; \n2) from a Member State to an OECD country \u2013 instead of general information requirements; \n3) from a Member State to a non-OECD country when the shipment is not prohibited by the \n\nimporting country, instead of national or no control procedures eventually applied by the \nimporting country, according to Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 (Section 4.2). \n\nThe WSR is currently undergoing a review, initially of its effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and \ncoherence as well as the added value it provides. By 31 December 2020, the EC has to report back on \nthis review to the European Parliament and the Council and if appropriate table a proposal to revise \nthe Regulation. It seems important that this review takes account of current developments in the \nwaste trade and their effects on the EU waste treatment market, and in particular on plastic wastes. \n\n4.2. Legislation/initiatives on trade in plastic waste to/by non-EU countries \n\nSome non-EU countries have prohibited the import of certain plastic waste or have specific control \nprocedures in place. In particular, in accordance with the WSR\u2019s Article 37.1, the EC has sent a written \nrequest to each non-OECD country seeking confirmation in writing that non-hazardous waste may be \nexported for recovery in that country and requesting an indication as to which control procedure, if \nany, would be followed in the country of destination. Non-OECD countries\u2019 replies have been \npublished within Commission Implementing Regulation No 1418/2007, which is periodically updated. \nCountries that have not issued confirmation in writing that waste may be exported to them are to be \n\nhttps://resource-recycling.com/resourcerecycling/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/UNEP-CHW-COMM-Legal-CLI-Annexes-20180608.English.pdf\f\n \n\n33 \n \n\nregarded as having permitted the related shipments under the procedure of prior written notification \nand consent \u2013 the most stringent control procedure under the WSR.  \n\nFigure 4.1 maps bans and control procedures applied by non-OECD countries on the import from the \nEU of non-hazardous solid plastic waste, mixed solid plastic waste and PVC, pursuant to Commission \nImplementing Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007, as updated in 2014. \n\n \nFigure 4.1.

In 2017, a new initiative permanently banned the \nimport of certain types of household plastic waste (WTO, 2017)32. The import ban came into force \nin January 2018, raising issues of other possible export routes for EU plastic waste. According to an \n\n                                                           \n32 According to the notification, the ban on household plastic wastes applies to imports of waste or scrap \npolymers of the following resins: ethylene (HS 3915100000); styrene (3915200000); vinyl chloride (3915300000); \nPET (3915901000); other plastics (3915909000). \n\f\n \n\n34 \n \n\nannouncement by the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and the Environment in April 2018, the \ncatalogue of banned solid waste was extended to include post-industrial PE, PET, PS, PVC and \nother scrap plastic, with effect from the end of 2018 (Resource Recycling website a). The import of \nWEEE has been banned since 2000 (EFFACE, 2015). \n\n\u2022 Thailand issued a temporary ban on the import of plastic waste and WEEE in June 2018 (No-Burn \nOrg website) and announced the introduction of a permanent ban by 2021 when current import \nlicenses will expire (The Telegraph website).  \n\n\u2022 In 2018, Malaysia revoked approved permits for plastic waste imports of 114 waste processing \nfactories as a temporary measure (No-Burn Org website) and, at the end of that year, announced \nan immediate and permanent ban on the import of plastic waste (Recycling International website).  \n\n\u2022 Taiwan Province of China recently proposed a set of policies to regulate imports of plastic waste \nincluding permission for businesses to import plastic waste only originating from their own \noverseas production processes and prioritising the purchase of domestic over foreign waste. \nThese policies became effective in October 2018 (No-Burn Org, 2018; Resource Recycling website).  \n\n\u2022 Viet Nam stopped issuing plastic recycling import licenses in June 2018 and it is expected to ban \nplastic waste imports in the future (No-Burn Org website). \n\n\u2022 On March 2019, India prohibited the import of solid plastic waste by amending the Hazardous \nWaste (Management & Trans-boundary Movement) Rules (Recycling Today website). \n\n4.3. Recent EU initiatives on plastic waste  \n\nIn the last few years, the EU has taken several policy and legislative initiatives to address plastics and \nplastics waste, with direct and indirect impacts on the trade in waste plastics. In particular, it has to be \nunderlined that all the measures aimed at plastic waste prevention and reusing plastic products \ndecrease plastic waste generation and, indirectly, the potential export of plastic waste.  \n\nOn the other hand, all the measures that support separate collection, recycling and reduce the \nlandfilling of plastic waste may have a twofold impact on plastic waste shipments. These measures, in \ntheory, may generate an increase in plastic waste exported to non-OECD countries, since more plastic \nwaste would be collected to be recycled and the WSR allows EU countries to ship plastic waste \ndestined for recycling/recovery to non-OECD countries. Moreover, considering waste recycling targets \napplying to packaging waste, ELVs and WEEE, it has to be noted that recycling rates in Europe are \ncalculated as the waste collected for recycling, including waste exported for recycling, provided that \nthere is sound evidence that recycling takes place under conditions that are broadly equivalent to \nthose prescribed by the EU legislation (European Commission, 2005a, 2005b and 2005c).  \n\nHowever, the measures supporting plastic waste collection and recycling, since they are aimed at \ndeveloping and strengthening the EU plastic recycling market, make Member States\u2019 plastic waste \nmanagement less dependent on the export to non-EU countries. This decrease in the export of plastic \nwaste outside the EU may be supported by plastic waste bans introduced by non-OECD countries, if \nthey are properly implemented and enforced. \n\nIn 2015, the Commission adopted the Action Plan for a Circular Economy (European Commission, \n2015), identifying plastics as a key priority. In the same year, the Packaging Waste Directive (Directive \n94/62/EC; EU, 1994) was amended (by Directive 2015/720/EU; EU, 2015) and Member States were \nrequired to introduce measures to cut the consumption of plastic bags \u2013 a prevention measure aimed \nat decreasing plastic waste generation.  \n\nIn 2017, the Commission Work Programme 2018 (European Commission, 2018b), confirmed that the \nEU would focus on plastics production and use to ensure that all plastic packaging is recyclable by \n2030. The EU Plastic Strategy of 2018 (European Commission, 2018a) reaffirmed that objective and \nshaped a systemic approach to protect the environment from plastic pollution, while fostering growth \n\f\n \n\n35 \n \n\nand innovation. The Strategy aims to transform the way plastic products are designed, produced, used \nand recycled in the EU, laying the foundations for a new plastic economy. To this end, the EU will take \nmeasures to prevent/minimise the generation of plastic waste and to stop littering at sea. Moreover, \nit will improve the profitability and quality of plastics recycling by focusing on separate collection and \nsorting; design for recyclability and the demand for recycled plastics. Support for innovation will be \nscaled up to finance the development of smarter and more recyclable plastic materials, making \nrecycling processes more efficient, and tracing and removing hazardous substances and contaminants \nfrom recycled plastics. \n\nWithin the framework of the Circular Economy Package, several measures have been introduced to \nreduce the amount of plastic waste destined for landfilling, while increasing recycling. The recent \namendments to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (pursuant to Directive 2018/852/EU; EU, \n2018) have increased the current recycling target for plastic packaging waste from 22.5 per cent to 50 \nand 55 per cent to be reached, respectively, by 2025 and 2030. Moreover, the amended Waste \nFramework Directive (EU, 2008) sets reuse/recycling rates of 55, 60 and 65 per cent by 2025, 2030 and \n2035 respectively for municipal waste, which includes several waste streams containing plastic, and \nthe amended Landfill Directive (EU, 1999) establishes that the amount of municipal waste landfilled \nshall be reduced to 10 per cent of the total amount of municipal waste generated by 2035. Member \nStates shall also endeavour to ensure that, as of 2030, all waste suitable for recycling or other \nrecovery, in particular in municipal waste, shall not be accepted in a landfill, with the exception of \nwaste for which landfilling delivers the best environmental outcome. \n\nApart from packaging waste and MSW, collection, recycling and recovery targets have also been set by \nEU legislation for other waste streams that contain plastic including ELVs, WEEE and construction and \ndemolition waste (EU, 2000, 2008 and 2012). \n\nA new Directive has been recently adopted by the EU in 2019 to reduce the impact of single-use \nplastic products on the environment (EU, 2019a), introducing a wide range of different measures for \ndifferent types of plastic product (Annex I).  \n\nSome of these measures, such as prohibition to place on the market and measurable reduction in \nconsumption, are aimed at preventing plastic waste generation, while others, including separate \ncollection targets and extended producer responsibility, mainly support waste collection and recycling, \nwith the potential twofold conflicting impacts on trade, discussed above. The proposal also sets a \nmandatory minimum recycled content for plastic bottles, with the aim of increasing EU demand for \nrecycled plastic, which currently represents around 6 per cent of EU plastics production (European \nCommission, 2018a).  \n\nThis requirement is likely to decrease the export of waste plastic for recycling to non-OECD countries. \nThe International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) (2014) argues that in China, before the introduction \nof the plastic waste import ban, most of the finished products containing secondary raw materials \nfrom imported plastic waste were destined to the national market because of their lower quality \nand/or cost. This could, in theory, apply to other non-OECD countries, making it unlikely that products \ncontaining recycled plastic are re-exported to EU Member States. \n\nIn 2018, the EC proposed a new Directive on port reception facilities for the delivery of waste from \nships, repealing Directive 2000/59/EC (European Commission, 2018d). According to the new Directive, \nwhich was adopted in April 2019 (EU, 2019b), ships, including fishing vessels, will be required to pay a \nfee, regardless of whether or not they unload any waste, to cover the costs of operating port facilities \nfor the reception and treatment of waste from ships, other than cargo residues. In this way, since \nships have already paid to use the port waste management facilities, they are expected to be less \nlikely to dump their waste overboard, thereby contributing to a reduction in marine litter. The fee will \n\f\n \n\n36 \n \n\nbe based on the principle of full cost recovery \u2013costs that are not covered by the fee, if any, shall be \ncovered by additional fees levied on the types and quantities of waste actually unloaded. A reduced \nwaste fee will be applied for short-distance sea shipping and for \u2018green ships\u201933. \n\nIn the Communication on the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, the Commission has \nproposed, in order to finance the long-term EU budget, a basket of new Own Resources, including a \nnational contribution calculated on the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste in each \nMember State (European Commission, 2018e). This measure is expected to increase plastic waste \nrecycling. \n\nAccording to the 2018 EU Plastic Strategy (European Commission, 2018a), the EC will work on a \nrevision of the essential requirements for placing packaging on the market, listed by Directive \n94/62/EC (EU, 1994), with the objective of ensuring that, by 2030, all plastics packaging placed on the \nEU market is reusable or easily recycled. The measure, the adoption of which is planned for the end of \n2020, is aimed at supporting plastic waste prevention, reuse and recycling. \n\n4.4. EU legislation on chemicals  \n\nTo minimise the associated risks, EU legislation regulates the manufacture, placing on the market, and \nuse of chemical substances. The more the use of hazardous chemicals in plastic products is prohibited \nor restricted, the less hazardous plastic waste is generated and the higher is the related recycling \npotential. In particular, the EU Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of \nChemicals (REACH) (EU, 2006), through its authorisation procedure, provides for the progressive \nreplacement of the substances of very high concern by less dangerous substances or technologies and \nfor the restriction of the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals posing unacceptable \nrisks to human health and the environment. Moreover, food contact packaging must comply with the \nrequirements of the European Food Safety Authority (European Commission, 2011) and several other \nplastic products are affected by specific regulations (EU, 2009).  \n\nThis legislation, as waste legislation, is continuously evolving. In January 2019, for instance, the \nEuropean Chemical Agency (ECHA) has submitted a restriction proposal for microplastic particles that \nare intentionally added to mixtures used by consumers or professionals. The Agency believes that, if \nadopted, the restriction could reduce the amount of microplastics released to the environment in the \nEU by about 400,000 tonnes over 20 years (ECHA website). \n\nIn many cases, if, for example, products are not labelled or information on chemical content is not \ntraceable through the value chain, it is not obvious which chemical substances are contained in plastic \nproducts. This has clear potential health, safety and environmental risks, especially if these products \nare recovered (OECD, 2018) and is likely to operate as a driver of the extra-EU export of waste plastics. \n\nAdditionally, requirements applied to specific plastic products lack harmonisation with wider \nlegislation regulating hazardous substances. For instance, according to the OECD (2018), diethylhexyl \nphthalate (DEHP), a plasticiser contained in flexible PVC, is subject to authorisation and restrictions \nunder REACH but it is often managed as a non-hazardous waste and its use has been authorised as a \nplastic food-contact material.   \n\n                                                           \n33 Pursuant to Article 8 of the new Directive on port reception facilities for the delivery of waste from ships (EU, \n2019b), the fees shall be reduced provided that the ship\u2019s design, equipment and operation demonstrate that \nthe ship produces reduced quantities of waste, and manages its waste in a sustainable and environmentally \nsound manner. \n\f\n \n\n37 \n \n\n4.5. Voluntary initiatives by industry  \n\nImprovement in the collection and recycling of plastic waste is not only supported by several EC \nlegislative and policy initiatives, but also by a wide range of voluntary commitments and measures \nthat are increasingly been taken by the private sector. \n\nAnnex III of the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy (European Commission, 2018a) \ncalled on stakeholders to submit voluntary pledges to ensure that overall 10 million tonnes of recycled \nplastics find their way into new European products by 2025. By end 2018, the Commission received \npledges from 70 companies and business organisations, which were assessed by the EC. It concluded \nthat the pledges received from suppliers of recycled plastics, if delivered as expected, are sufficient to \nmeet the target of 10 million tonnes, but that there is still a mismatch between the pledges from the \nsupply and the demand sides (European Commission, 2019a). In order to bridge the gap and stimulate \nfurther dialogue between the suppliers of recycled plastics and their customers, in December 2018 the \nEC launched the Circular Plastics Alliance, a platform of key industry stakeholders covering the full \nplastics value chain.  \n\nShortly after the Strategy\u2019s publication, Plastic Europe, representing European plastics manufacturers, \nmade a voluntary commitment to ensure high rates of reuse, recycling and recovery of plastic \npackaging waste, with the ambition of reaching 60 per cent of reuse/recycling by 2030 and 100 per \ncent by 2040 in the EU, Norway and Switzerland (Plastic Europe, 2018b). To this end, action plans and \ntime-based performance indicators will be prepared and progress will be evaluated by an independent \ncommittee made up of representatives of the EC, European Parliament, national and local authorities, \ncivil society and academia34.  \n\nThe European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has adopted a set of harmonised standards for \npackaging, published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, providing a presumption of \nconformity with the essential requirements set by the Packaging Waste Directive (EU, 1994), with \nwhich all packaging placed on the market in the EU have to comply35.  The definition of biodegradable \nplastic, provided by the proposed Directive on Single-Use Plastic Products (European Commission, \n2018c), is based on the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) standard for compostable and \nbiodegradable packaging (CEN, 2000). \n\nOther relevant initiatives jointly undertaken by various stakeholders at the EU level include the \nfollowing. \n\n\u2022 European PET Bottle Platform: a voluntary industry initiative that provides PET bottle design \nguidelines for recycling (EPBP website). \n\n\u2022 Polyolefin Circular Economy Platform, involving European Plastics Converters (EuPC), \nPlasticEurope, Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE), etc.): the platform has two strategic goals, \nnamely innovation with a circular economy focus and enhanced collection and sorting systems \n(Polyolefin Circular Economy Platform website). \n\n                                                           \n34https://www.plasticseurope.org/application/files/6115/1700/8779/PlasticsEurope_Voluntary_Commitment_1\n6012018.pdf  \n35 CEN EN 13427:2004: Requirements for the use of European standards in the field of packaging and packaging \nwaste; CEN EN 13428:2004: Requirements specific to manufacturing and composition \u2013 prevention by source \nreduction; CEN EN 13429:2004: Reuse; CEN EN 13430:2004: Requirements for packaging recoverable by material \nrecycling; CEN EN 13431:2004: Requirements for packaging recoverable in the form of energy recovery, including \nspecification of minimum inferior calorific value; CEN EN 13432:2000: Requirements for packaging recoverable \nthrough composting and biodegradation \u2013 test scheme and evaluation criteria for the final acceptance of \npackaging.  \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1516265440535&uri=COM:2018:28:FIN\f\n \n\n38 \n \n\n\u2022 At the international level, the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment was signed in 2018 \nby more than 350 companies that, together, are responsible for 20 per cent of all plastic \npackaging produced globally. It sets a 2025 target to make 100 per cent of plastic packaging \nreusable, recyclable or compostable (New Plastics Economy website).  \n\n\u2022 At the beginning of 2019, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste was launched as a non-for-profit \norganisation, made up of about 30 member companies that produce, use, sell, process, \ncollect, and recycle plastics. It has allocated USD1.5 billion over the next five years to finance \nthe implementation of a strategy which identifies infrastructure development, innovation, \neducation and clean-up as priorities (Alliance to End Plastic Waste website). \n\n4.6. Options for \u2018sustainable plastics waste trade\u2019 \n\nEurope is at a crossroads for plastics, plastics waste, and trade in waste plastics. The restrictions to the \nexport option, which has to date been part of the solution for managing the mounting quantities of \nplastic waste, could strongly promote EU policy efforts to prevent plastic waste and to manage it \ndomestically to the highest environmental standards and the best potential economic benefits.  \n\nTrade restrictions on plastic waste are bound to increase as a result of a domino effect amongst \nimporting countries. Without action, the potential consequences could include negative conditions for \nachieving the ambitious targets for plastics recycling introduced in the revised Packaging and \nPackaging Waste Directive, the redirection of intra-EU trade flows, and increasing consideration of \nincineration of plastics waste for energy production as an option. Therefore, trade restrictions on \nplastic waste provide pressure on EU Member States to find alternative solutions for managing postconsumer plastics. \n\nThe current end-of-life management of plastics in the EU is underperforming compared to more \nhomogeneous materials such as glass and metals (Deloitte, 2017). The significant share of plastic \nwaste exported beyond the EU for recycling or recovery can result in a significant loss of valuable \nresources to the EU economy and in a significant cost to the environment of the importing countries. \nWith the 2018 Plastics Strategy, the EU has adopted \u2018a material-specific lifecycle approach to integrate \ncircular design, use, reuse and recycling activities into [the] plastics value chain\u2019 (European \nCommission, 2019b).  \n\nAll the policy options that are available to implement a circular economy for plastics, directly or \nindirectly, impact on trade in plastic waste.  \n\nThe following could be options for action. \n\n\u2022 While the implementation of the new waste Directives and the Plastics Strategy will push to \nincrease the quantity of plastic waste collected, thus possibly adding pressures on the quantity \nof plastics traded, it could significantly improve the quality and attributes of plastics waste. This \ncould possibly reduce trade as higher quality could increase domestic demand and also have \npositive consequences on environmental impacts in importing countries.  \n\n\u2022 Being at the top of the EU waste hierarchy, prevention and reuse represent an effective way of \nreducing plastic waste generation and the related environmental impacts. With regard to the \nprevention of plastic waste, when the related measures result in a shift towards the use of \nalternative materials, the sustainability of the latter could be assessed, based on a life-cycle \nassessment perspective. The same could apply to novel plastic materials such as plastics from \nrenewable feedstock or biodegradable and compostable plastics. Reuse provides an \neconomically attractive opportunity for selected plastic packaging items including carrier bags, \nhome-care bottles and pallet wraps. However, it needs to be adequately supported, as it often \n\f\n \n\n39 \n \n\nrequires a systemic change, entailing the development of innovative business models and \nspecific infrastructure including reverse logistic systems and cleaning facilities (OECD, 2018; \nEllen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).  \n\n\u2022 Collection is an essential precondition for high quality recycling, but, compared to other waste \nstreams, it poses specific challenges in the case of plastic waste. For instance, amongst plastic \npackaging waste, small-items, even when collected rather than becoming litter, are removed in \nautomated sorting facilities to avoid damage to equipment in subsequent steps; nutrientcontaminated packaging is often difficult to sort and clean; dark and black plastics cannot be \nidentified in optical sorting processes; etc. (Deloitte, 2017; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). \nCollection and sorting systems could be improved, based on best practice and appropriate \ninvestment, to become more efficient/effective and offer greater opportunities for recycling \nand eventually downcycling. This could contribute to reducing plastic waste landfilling and \nlittering. The achievement of both these objectives is also highly dependent on consumers\u2019 \nchoices and behaviour, which can be affected by awareness raising and information campaigns. \nDeposit refund systems generally prove to be an effective instrument to ensure a high/stable \nsupply of reusable/recyclable materials. \n\n\u2022 Levels of recycling should be increased, both in terms of quality and quantity. Mechanical \nrecycling technologies, which are currently mainly focused on PET and HDPE, could be also \nused for recycling other polymers. The potential of chemical recycling, which is still at an early \nstage of development, could be better explored to strike a balance between regulatory \ncompliance, environmental impacts and economic viability (Deloitte, 2017). Investment in \nrecycling infrastructure/technologies could be stimulated and supported. \n\n\u2022 Chemicals matter in the whole lifecycle of plastic products. The use of hazardous chemicals in \nplastic products is prohibited/restricted by several pieces of EU legislation. A wide range of \nchemical substances are, however, often added to plastics to deliver specific qualities and \nmaterial properties. In many cases, the chemical content of plastics is not traceable through \nthe value chain as there is a lack of internationally harmonised databases and information \nsystems, and, if these materials are recycled, chemicals may enter the recycling stream \nundiscovered. This can hamper the quality of secondary raw materials and make them \nunsuitable substitutes for virgin materials in some applications. For this reason, in order to \nsupport the development of an effective after-use plastic economy, stringent standards could \nbe developed to certify the quality of plastic raw materials (OECD, 2018). The legislator, by \nadopting a systemic approach, should ensure the coherence of the requirements for chemicals \nused in plastics in the whole value chain. \n\n\u2022 Based on EU legislation, most of the waste streams containing plastics \u2013 packaging waste, \nWEEE and ELVs \u2013 are covered by extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes and new \nones will be set up in the future to address selected single-use plastic products. There is \nempirical evidence that EPR schemes, combined with the use of collection/recycling targets, \nlead to an increase in separate collection and recycling of waste, reducing both landfilling and \nlittering (OECD, 2016). However, there is still a significant potential for improvement, at least in \nthe respect of the following points. \n\no The effectiveness of EPR schemes with regard to design for the environment (DfE) is \nlower than expected, but DfE is pivotal to improving plastic waste management. For \ninstance, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2017), without fundamental \nredesign and innovation, about 30 per cent of plastic packaging could never be reused or \nrecycled. To date, only a few true fee-modulation mechanisms have been applied by EPR \nschemes (IEEP, 2017). A wider use of eco-modulated fees, fees modulated based on \n\f\n \n\n40 \n \n\ncriteria related to products\u2019 environmental impacts, could support DfE. Design \nrequirements, taken into account by modulated fees, are more likely to be effective if \nthey are harmonised at the international level, especially when products are globally \ntraded (OECD, 2016). \n\no Currently, EPR schemes for packaging waste, WEEE and ELVs can meet their related \nrecycling/recovery targets by exporting the collected waste. This option could be \ndiscouraged when plastic waste is traded to non-OECD countries, where it is often \ndifficult to ensure that recycling/recovery takes place under \u2018broadly equivalent \nenvironmental conditions\u2019. This objective could be achieved through regulatory measures \n\u2013 for example, by amending the method for calculating the recycling/recovery targets set \nby the relevant EU legislation or, at least, by prohibiting, within the WSR, that the plastic \nwaste that can be recycled is exported beyond the EU for the purpose of energy recovery; \nor through the use of market-based instruments. If, in the latter case, revenues are \ngenerated, these could be used to fund the development of collection and recycling \ninfrastructures in the non-OECD importing countries. Further, more transparency is \nneeded in the decisions taken by EPR schemes on the management of the collected waste \n\u2013 particularly on quantities/types of plastic waste that are exported beyond the EU. \n\n\u2022 The EU market for plastic raw materials needs to be strengthened/created. Some supporting \nmeasures are being introduced, such as, targets related to the minimum recycling content of \nbeverage containers set by the Single-Use Plastics Directive, while others, including standards \ncertifying the quality of secondary raw materials or obligations for public procurement of \nproducts with a specified share of recycled material, could be shaped in the future to increase \nthe demand for plastic recyclates.  \n\n\u2022 Landfills bans: countries with landfill restrictions on recyclable and recoverable waste, including \nplastic, show higher plastic waste recovery rates and also, on average, higher recycling rates \n(Plastic Europe, 2018a). These restrictions, as well as the use of market-based instruments \npenalising the disposal of recyclable/recoverable waste, could be considered best practice. \n\nInternational technology transfer, that is the transfer to plastic waste importing countries of better \nequipment and systems for plastics waste management aimed at lowering environmental impacts, \ncould be part of the EU strategy for plastics. The transfer of knowledge and technologies could be \nsupported, for example, by existing channels of international cooperation for development, including \nthe growing green-finance sector, and also by EU financial institutions including the European \nInvestment Bank. \n \n  \n\f\n \n\n41 \n \n\nReferences  \n\nAl-Jaibachi, R., Cuthbert, R.N. and Callaghan A., 2018, Up and away: ontogenic transference as a \npathway for aerial dispersal of microplastics.

This briefing shows that there is significant potential to increase recycling from all of these streams. However, to fully exploit this potential, current barriers need to be overcome, e.g. price competition from virgin resource alternatives, infrastructure capacity and the complexity of certain waste products. This also requires strong implementation of targeted regulations to increase separate collection. Implementing new policy measures, some of which are already included in Europe\u2019s 2020 circular economy action plan, can both directly and indirectly exploit the potential for increased recycling.\nThis briefing summarises the key findings of a technical report commissioned by the EEA.\nWaste policies at EU level follow principles designed to achieve a gradual, but steady, increase in the level of recycling of a waste stream compared with the amount generated. The Waste Framework Directive (WFD) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive are based on the premise of increasing recycling rates for municipal and construction and demolition waste as well as for electronic waste. In addition, Europe\u2019s circular economy agenda calls for keeping materials in the economy for as long as possible and their value as high as possible.\nSource: EEA\nTechnical, economic and social issues often hinder achieving more ambitious levels of recycling, beyond the targets set. Examples include, respectively:\nthe presence of technically non-recyclable materials and products in waste streams;\nthe increasing cost of separate collection as more materials are collected;\nconsumers\u2019 difficulty in distinguishing and correctly separating materials in complex products.\nAgainst this background, the underlying question emerges: \u2018What is the potential for recycling, and what are the maximum recycling levels Europe can achieve under currently implemented EU waste legislation?\nThis briefing provides estimates of the untapped potential for separate collection for recycling (see Box 1) in three waste streams and puts future developments in policymaking in perspective. It examines the municipal, construction and demolition (mineral part only), and electronic waste streams. Together, these comprise a significant part of total waste generation in Europe.\nThe estimates presented are based on the latest available data and the current status of implementation of EU waste legislation. This means that the measures in the latest circular economy action plan of the European Green Deal and some of the most recent amendments to EU waste directives are not taken into account. These might have a profound effect on the levels of separate collection that could be achieved.\nPlease note that the calculations of the untapped potential for collection for recycling also might change once waste prevention measures are further implemented. This is because both the amount of waste generated and the material recyclability will be affected by, for example, the phasing out of hazardous substances in products.\nThe methodology for estimating the potential increase in separate collection for each of the selected waste streams is based on:\neither reports in the literature estimating theoretical upper limit values for separate collection of specific materials, or\nbenchmarks of separate collection achieved in specific areas and specific waste management system configurations.\nA detailed description of the methodology can be found in the technical report.\nNote: Data for construction and demolition waste are from the EU-28, Iceland and Norway (2016). Data for municipal waste are from the EU-28, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey (2018). Data for electronic waste are from the EU-28, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (2017).\nSource: Eurostat, EEA.\nAlthough the latest data available (2016) show that the current levels of recycling of construction and demolition waste are already high (Figure 2), the nature of this waste stream\u2019s material fractions may enable even higher separate collection rates.\nIn 2016, most of the non-recycled waste was used for \u2018backfilling\u2019 operations, e.g. using waste material to fill excavated holes. However, backfilling is not considered recycling and it is not the most environmentally sound waste treatment option.\nTaking account of the material composition of this waste stream, the maximum potential for separately collecting each material fraction was estimated. By combining these estimates per material, a potential separate collection rate for the entire stream was calculated at 96 % or 76 million tonnes more separate collection than the 2016 level of around 250 million tonnes. This potential is mainly based on increasing separate collection of masonry, concrete and asphalt wastes. The calculations account for only the mineral part of construction and demolition waste for both waste generation and recycling.\nThe target for 2020 stands at 70 % recovery (all waste, not just the mineral part), so there is room for potentially increasing the target in the future, especially by upgrading waste currently used in backfilling to recycled waste.\nSeparate collection of municipal waste, stimulated by ambitious EU legislation, is steadily increasing over time. New, higher recycling targets were introduced in the amended Waste Framework Directive in 2018, which indicates even higher separate collection in the future.\nAn estimate for this stream shows that the potential for increased separate collection of waste is above the future EU targets. If all the potential is harnessed, separate collection rates of around 80 % can be achieved (Figure 2). This means that 111 million tonnes more material could be separately collected (in 2018, recycling stood at 126 million tonnes), based on waste generation in 2018. This untapped potential is mainly linked to food and plastic but also garden and textile wastes.\nThe amended 2018 Directive introduced a target for recycling of 65 % by 2035. This is particularly ambitious, compared with the estimated maximum potential of 80 %. The target refers to final recycled amounts, not to amounts of waste collected for recycling. The latter includes amounts of non-recyclable materials or contaminants, which are removed during waste processing, so the 80 % potential for separate collection corresponds to lower levels of final recycling.\nThis is the smallest waste stream, in terms of mass, examined in this briefing. Electronic waste, however, contains valuable resources (e.g. metals and critical raw materials). It is also the waste stream with the lowest recycling rate, mainly because of failures in separately collecting this type of waste (see Box 2). As electronic waste is composed mainly of metals, plastic and glass, which are routinely recycled (unless they contain hazardous substances), there is a significant opportunity to increase recycling.\nThe estimation of the maximum collection rate for recycling, unlike the other waste streams, is not based on the stream\u2019s material composition, as the separate collection of this waste is not designed per material but per product category. Therefore, based on the latest official data for maximum recycling achieved per waste product category, the potential for separate collection of electronic waste for recycling stands at 4 million tonnes of additional separate collection, or a 75 % separate collection rate (Figure 2).\nWaste from electrical and electronic equipment is somewhat different from the other waste streams examined in this briefing. The main issues that waste management systems face are collecting electronic waste separately from other streams and avoiding illegal exports and recycling under non-compliant conditions.\nAnother issue is that many waste materials and products are contaminated with hazardous substances, such as flame retardants, making recycling difficult or impossible, as these substances cannot be recirculated into the economy for health reasons.\nThe circular economy agenda is particularly relevant to electronic waste as it calls for a reduction in hazardous substances in products to improve their recyclability and for measures such as the \u2018right to repair\u2019 and incentives to design-for-recycling. Therefore, implementing circular economy-related measures for this type of waste would enable us to realise much of the untapped potential for recycling.\nA separate recent EEA briefing provides additional information on this waste stream.\nThe barriers to increasing separate collection of waste for recycling can be common to all three waste streams or waste stream specific.\nOf the common barriers, the markets for recyclables often underperform. The price differential between recycled materials and virgin material alternatives is normally unfavourable. Moreover, the consequently relatively low revenues from recyclables strain the economics underpinning separate collection systems.\nAnother issue is that the quality of materials collected for recycling can vary, meaning that recycling plants cannot count on streamlined inputs of materials with a specific quality. Recyclers cannot count either on pan-European end-of-waste criteria for all recyclables. The combination of these factors explains the weak demand for some recyclables from processing and recycling plants.\nBarriers of a more technical nature include the lack of recycling infrastructures in Europe, especially for emerging recyclables such as plastics. This means that increasing quantities of materials collected for recycling cannot be accommodated in European plants and are often exported for further processing. Another technical barrier is the very nature of waste materials and products: some materials are technically non-recyclable or are composed of mixed materials that are hard to separate.\nTo overcome these barriers, Europe needs strong and effective regulation in combination with effective implementation and enforcement. More specifically, regulations on the following could lead to significantly more separately collected waste:\nmandatory separate collection (municipal waste);\neffective extended producer responsibility schemes regulated by fees (electronic waste);\nselective demolition (construction and demolition waste).\nFurthermore, in the unfavourable secondary material markets, the use of taxes and subsidies might be further explored to promote the uptake of recyclables and assist the transition to a more circular economy. Phasing out hazardous substances in products and developing standards for recyclables would increase products\u2019 recyclability and lead to a stronger demand in the secondary material markets.\nThe 2020 circular economy action plan addresses many of the barriers hindering significant increases in recycling and also introduces measures that can be taken at product design and use stages. The wide uptake of measures such as phasing out hazardous substances in products, design-for-recycling or design-for-disassembly, and the \u2018right to repair\u2019 initiative would make more material available for separate collection and therefore recycling.\nThe action plan also proposes harmonising separate collection systems, which would increase their efficiency and lead to more recyclables being captured in separate collection schemes. Circular economy measures may also increase the potential for recycling, as estimated in this briefing, by enabling the recycling of currently non-recyclable materials and products.\nBriefing no. 03/2020\nTitle: The case for increasing recycling: Estimating the potential for recycling in Europe\nPDF TH-AM-20-004-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-233-0 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/72478\nHTML TH-AM-20-004-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-234-7 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/5309\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union did not affect the production of this briefing.
