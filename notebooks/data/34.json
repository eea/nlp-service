Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it!\nArticle\nArticle Published 30 Sep 2021 Last modified 30 Sep 2021\n6 min read\nPhoto: \u00a9 Alexander Zackrisson, REDISCOVER Nature /EEA\nEuropean nature is suffering the consequences of long-term exploitation and pollution. Nature keeps providing us with food, clothes, medicines, housing, energy and other resources, but ecosystems and many plants and animals are in decline, sometimes being pushed to extinction. What are the human activities that harm nature the most and how can we stop and reverse current biodiversity loss?\nWe humans are the species that has changed the Earth like no other species. We have had a major impact on almost all other species that share the planet with us and on their habitats. Europe, as one of the most densely populated areas on Earth, is no exception.\nAlmost 40 % of the EU\u2019s land is used for growing food, according to Eurostat. While traditional agriculture allowed a diverse range of animals and plants to coexist with crops, changes in agricultural practices since 1950, in the direction of intensification and specialisation, have contributed to a high degree of biodiversity loss. According to the EEA\u2019s the increased use of fertilisers, irrigation and pesticides and the intense modification of the land are key pressures on local animals and plants, and especially on birds.\nPollution by pesticides used in agriculture is the main cause of the worrying decline in the number of insect-eating birds and farmland birds.\nOne of the most important pressures is the ceasing of traditional grassland management. Pollinators, such as bees, bumblebees and butterflies, are highly affected by it. Fragmentation of the land and drainage, for agricultural purposes, destroy the habitats where birds, reptiles and small mammals used to feed, find shelter and breed.\nWe often link pollution to industry, transport and energy production, which are important sources, but almost 50 % of the pressures on nature related to pollution come from agricultural emissions to air, water and soil. Pollution by pesticides used in agriculture is the main cause of the worrying decline in the number of insect-eating birds and farmland birds. Pesticide pollution also affects amphibians, such as frogs, toads and salamanders, insects and small mammals, including bats, hamsters and the European ground squirrel.\nSimilarly, pesticides and fertilisers have negatively affected about 80 % of the 576 butterfly species that live in Europe. Agriculture is also a major source of pollution for surface water and for groundwaters, affecting many ecosystems.\nPollution from agriculture is one of the main problems to be tackled by the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU\u2019s farm to fork strategy, which aims to reduce the use of chemical pesticides by half and to promote less intensive farming practices, including at least a 20 % reduction in fertiliser use.\nUrbanisation is another serious pressure on nature, but, perhaps surprisingly, most of the damage no longer comes from converting nature areas to urban territory (11 % of the pressures in this field, according to thebut instead from sports, tourism and leisure activities (25 % of urban pressures). However, construction and modification within urban areas also affect many species that are used to living in urban habitats (accounting for about 10 % of urban pressures).\nMoreover, roads, railways, dams and other infrastructure also fragment habitats and destroy landscapes. Traffic disturbs and kills wildlife. Soils, as important reservoirs of biodiversity, are damaged when they are sealed with buildings, asphalt or concrete.\nMuch of the European coastline is modified for tourism, leaving little space for intact marine and coastal habitats. Water birds, such as ducks, geese, herons and grebes, and threatened raptors, such as the Egyptian vulture and the bearded vulture, are severely affected when their nesting areas are destroyed.\nEuropeans\u2019 ecological footprint far exceeds what Europe\u2019s ecosystems can supply. This has negative consequences for the environment within and outside Europe.\nEuropean production and consumption, which is higher than the global average, contribute to environmental degradation in other parts of the world. For example,including those due to goods imported into the EU and consumed by Europeans.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), about 75 % of the terrestrial environment and 40 % of the marine environment are severely altered globally.\nAs the world\u2019s biodiversity is declining, and the global ecological footprint is already exceeding biocapacity, Europe\u2019s ecological deficit may result in the depletion of natural capital, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse in other parts of the world.\nHowever, as the EEA\u2019snotes, the EU can play a positive role in responding to these global challenges through its economic, diplomatic and trade links and its leadership in environmental governance. Moreover, European product standards and business practices can have positive effects well beyond Europe\u2019s borders.\nAlmost all of Europe\u2019s forests have been transformed by human interventions. Even after reforestation, the nature of human-managed forests is different. For example, the habitat can be negatively affected if there are fewer trees of different species and ages.\nDespite all the protection measures,without new trees being planted in Europe.\nThe removal of dead and old trees and the reduction in old-growth forests affects many species of insects, birds, amphibians, reptiles, bats and small mammals, such as the western barbastelle, the Caucasian squirrel and the forest dormouse.\nDespite all the protection measures, without new trees being planted in Europe.\nAt least 52 million wild birds are hunted by humans every year in Europe, according to research that covers 26 European countries. Moreover, illegal killing is threatening many species, particularly birds and mammals, while feral and free-ranging cats and dogs present an additional threat.\nFish are affected by harvesting, as are marine mammals, such as the short-beaked common dolphin and the harbour porpoise, which sometimes fall prey to bycatch.\nEven when we try to enjoy nature, we may unwillingly harm habitats and species around us. Many recreational activities, such as outdoor sports, leisure aircraft, drones, human trampling and unregulated wildlife watching, can be very damaging to nature.\nSometimes intentionally, sometimes by accident, Europeans have brought new plants and animal species to the continent. These new species are sometimes taking over habitats and disturbing ecosystems, which is why they are called invasive alien species.\nSome of the most damaging invasive aliens are American mink, coypu and raccoon, which have become predators of European birds, and Reeves\u2032s muntjac, which browses understory habitats. The comb jellyfish, first introduced into the Black Sea through ships\u2019 ballast water, has devastated certain fish populations.\nThere are also alien species of plants that are taking over from local ones. False indigo-bush, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are just some examples.\nClimate change is already affecting life in Europe, with increased temperatures, droughts, changes in rain patterns, wildfires and less snow. It is seen as an emerging threat to European species, and it will affect more and more animals and plants.\nWe are witnessing local and regional extinctions of species, as well as a move of the species northwards and uphill. Amphibians, birds and bats are the most affected species by droughts and changes in rain patterns.\nThewarned that ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation continue to worsen, endangering marine habitats.\nTo mitigate climate change, we need to produce energy in a sustainable way. Europe is leading the efforts towards decarbonisation, aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. This is a critical goal but, in some cases, development of renewable energy can harm habitats and species. For example, wind turbines can create a threat to bats and birds, which can collide with the blades, and dams can block the passage of sediments and migratory fish.\nIt is crucial, therefore, that all measures towards decarbonisation are taken in a coordinated manner with biodiversity policies, to minimise the impacts on animals and habitats. There are many good solutions that benefit both climate and nature, such as improving the state of soils.\nThe factors described above are the most serious pressures on nature, in Europe, but they are not the only ones. Noise and light pollution coming from human activity also harm many species. There are many issues to tackle, but what is clear is that humans must learn again how to give space for nature to thrive. Failing to do so urgently could have consequences we cannot reverse.\nSource: State of nature in the EU, EEA Report No 10/2020.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2021/articles/what-is-harming-europe2019s-nature or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 08:51 AM\nFiled under: signals signals2021\nFiled under: signals, signals2021\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Extreme weather and climate-related events that result in hazards such as floods and droughts will become more frequent and intense in many regions. This leads to many adverse impacts on ecosystems, economic sectors, and human health and well-being. Therefore, actions to adapt to the impacts of climate change are paramount and should be tailored to specific circumstances in different parts of Europe. Examples of adaptation measures include:\nFor individuals and households:\nCapturing rainwater (e.g. for watering gardens or washing cars) to save drinking water and reduce pressure on sewerage systems during heavy precipitation;\nPlanting trees to create shade during heat waves;\nInsulating houses to reduce the need for cooling in summer (and heating in winter).\nFor cities and local authorities:\nIncreasing the presence of green spaces (e.g. to limit the urban heat island effect or to use as rain gardens during heavy precipitation);\nAdapting building codes to future climate conditions and extreme weather events;\nBuilding flood defenses and raising flood protection levels, including nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches where possible.\nFor sectoral stakeholders:\nPromoting the use of scarce water resources more efficiently, for example through reusing treated waste water;\nDeveloping drought-tolerant crops;\nChoosing tree species and forestry practices that are less vulnerable to storms and fires;\nSetting aside land corridors to help species migrate.\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Dianthus diutinus \u2013 Hungary\nBack to the Case Study Hub\nEndemic to the Pannonian biogeographical region, Dianthus diutinus inhabits open patchworks of grassland and scattered stands of forests, and is nowadays only found in the area between the Danube and Tisza rivers in central Hungary.\nThe majority of its habitat has been afforested and fragmented by large-scale pine tree plantations, and degraded due to the spread of invasive alien species. As a result, the population size of Dianthus diutinus had shrunk to approximately 20,000 individuals by 2007, consisting of 10 small and isolated subpopulations.\nThe LIFE project HUNDIDI implemented measures that eventually improved the population size and the quality of the habitat of Dianthus diutinus. The population reached 97,738 individuals by the end of the LIFE project in 2011. In addition, the area of interconnected and unbroken habitat for the species has increased to 455 ha.\nChallenges addressed\nThe main threats to the species result from habitat loss and fragmentation, which have occurred due to afforestation and forestry activity, and habitat degradation. As a result of the large-scale afforestation activities that were carried out in the second half of the 20th century, the area of shifting sand dunes that used to be characteristic of the region has declined greatly. Remnants of the former sand vegetation (including Dianthus diutinus) have survived only in patches. Habitat loss and fragmentation resulted in a declining population size and an increasing isolation of subpopulations, which reduced genetic diversity. In 2008, 70% of the total population of Dianthus diutinus could be found in alien forest plantations (pine trees): between the tree lines, at the side of forestry roads and in small grassland patches (maximum 1 ha) between forested areas. The spread of invasive alien species poses the greatest threat, with the rapid expansion of Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), Black Locust (Robinia pseudo-acacia), Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) and Black Cherry (Prunus serotina).\nObjectives\nThe main objective of the LIFE project HUNDIDI was to stabilise 85% of the presently known stands of the target species, Dianthus diutinus. This percentage relates to the number of individuals in populations inside the three project areas based on the Species Conservation Action Plan compiled in 2004. In order to reverse the continuous decrease of the population caused by habitat diminution and isolation of the subpopulations, the project aimed to create a semi-natural habitat network by enlarging and connecting present habitats at the three most important sites for the species: Bodogl\u00e1r, B\u00f3csa, Cs\u00e9vharaszt. These sites would not be affected by forestry activity. Informing the general public about the importance of these unique habitats was considered vital for improving the long-run survival of this species.\nPlanned and implemented measures\nA first set of key measures under LIFE HUNDIDI concerned the restoration of degraded and fragmented habitats, which consisted of thinning/clearing alien tree plantations of Black Pine, Black Locust and Tree of Heaven, and eliminating Common Milkweed in grassland areas at the three project sites. As regards the restoration of grasslands, mechanical methods were used in combination with the precise application of chemical treatments to eliminate the Common Milkweed. To avoid damaging the native vegetation, the treatment method was selected according to the density of the Common Milkweed stands and the natural status of the vegetation. In high nature value areas with few Common Milkweed plants, the leaves were treated with chemicals individually by brush, while the dense, heavily invaded areas were sprayed. Treatments were applied 2-3 times annually and resulted in a 90% decrease of the invaded area compared to 2007, and in a significant decrease in the density of surviving populations.\nIn parallel to the habitat restoration work, reintroduction of Dianthus diutinus, in collaboration with the University of Szeged was undertaken. The original aim was the ex situ propagation and re-establishment of 15,000 individuals in order to stabilize the size of the three natural populations, and to build up continuity between the natural patches with the newly planted individuals. One month after germination the seedlings were transplanted individually in growing pots and after two weeks of acclimation in a greenhouse, were planted out in good quality open perennial grasslands areas. The young plants were planted in patches, with the research team paying attention to making the pattern of plant patches similar to that of natural ones. Between autumn 2007 and spring 2011, the planting was repeated annually, so as to establish a plant stand with varying age structure, and comparisons were made of the survival of plants in the spring and autumn plantings.\nIn total, 18,777 of such ex situ raised plants were reintroduced to three project sites with survival rates varying from 10% to 80% depending on the season and the site. Consequently, these measures were considered to be highly successful and complementary to the habitat restoration work.\nStakeholder involvement\nIn addition to the habitat restoration and ex-situ conservation activities, public awareness raising and stakeholder mobilisation were important supporting measures that were implemented as part of the LIFE HUNDIDI project and contributed to its success. The long-term survival prospects of the target species was improved by informing the general public about the importance of its unique habitat. Over the course of the project, eight regional meetings with local foresters were held in order to ensure that their activities respect nature conservation goals. The information campaign also entailed the production of a wide range of materials and the installation of 17 information boards at the project sites and in the town of Kiskunmajsa and at the Botanical Garden of the Szeged University. The project also produced a film that was broadcasted five times on national TV channels. The project\u2019s results were also presented at nine scientific events, both in Hungary and abroad, and in six scientific articles. Finally, a nature trail was established at Bodogl\u00e1r in order to get visitors, both locals and tourists, acquainted with the strictly protected plant, its habitats and the conservation measures needed for their long-term survival. The trail had great demonstrational value, since the constructed board-walk and information boards provide a unique opportunity for visiting the area in an organised way without causing any soil or vegetation damage, both as self-organized or guided trips. It also demonstrated the fruitful cooperation of project partners and drew attention to the importance of the Natura 2000 network and locals involvement in the long-term protection of Dianthus diutinus.\nKey achievements and impacts\nMonitoring activities carried out as part of LIFE HUNDIDI show that a significant increase in the population size of Dianthus diutinus had occurred by 2011. Furthermore, habitat restoration extended the interconnected and unbroken habitat area for the target species to 455 ha.\nIt is important to stress that this increase in numbers was attributed not only to the success of the restoration activities but also to the intensive fieldwork, which led to the discovery of new populations. Over the course of LIFE HUNDIDI, four new populations of Dianthus diutinus were found, including one with more than 10,000 individuals. Therefore, the improvement in the conservation status of Dianthus Diutinus is not only genuine but also a result of better knowledge.\nOther impacts relate to the construction of the high-quality, freely accessible, nature trail on the Bodogl\u00e1r site (1.5 km). The nature trail was established in order to get visitors acquainted with the protected endemic plant and its habitat.\nThe nature conservational value of Dianthus diutinus has been estimated at 250,000 HUF.\nCosts and financing\nThe LIFE HUNDIDI project is the only known source of funding for the conservation measures taken for the species. It represented a total budget of \u20ac1,630,785, with an EU contribution of \u20ac1,223,088. Although the LIFE project played the primary role in achieving the improvement in the species\u2019 conservation status, the total costs of all the contributory conservation measures unknown.\nAs regards the activities carried out as part of the After-LIFE Conservation Plan, costs were born by the Kiskuns\u00e1g National Park, from its regular budget. To fund future activities, the National Park is considering applying for a new LIFE project.\nLessons learned\nThe key targeted conservation measures that led to the improvements\n- Artificial forest restructuring with indigenous species: thinning of pine woodland; creation of corridors and interconnections between habitat patches and population stands.\n- Eradication of alien plant species Common Milkweed and Black Locust through plant control methods.\n- The nursery for ex situ propagation of Dianthus diutinus.\n- Ex situ propagation and re-establishment of Dianthus diutinus.\nConservation measures that have not been sufficiently effective\n- More research on population dynamics is needed for lasting results\nFactors that supported the conservation measures\n- Establishment of good cooperation with forestry authorities.\n- Changes in the forestry regulations making the total deforestation of non-native trees and use of the areas for nature conservation easier.\n- Excellent cooperation with the LIFE HUNDIDI project partner - Botanic Garden University of Szeged, fully devoted to the project.\n- Very good cooperation with the local government.\n- Proper monitoring, but also detailed site surveys within the possible occurrence of the species, allowing the detection of new populations.\n- Awareness raising campaigns with attractive ideas.\nFactors that constrained conservation measures\n- Knowledge gaps in relation to the species\u2019 population dynamics, biology, seed production and the role of pollinators.\n- The growing game population.\nQuick wins that could be applied elsewhere for the species\n- Ex situ restoration demonstrated that for some plant species, large numbers of seedlings can be grown and successfully planted, thereby bolstering existing small populations.\nExamples of good practice, which could be applied to other species\n- Timely and smooth combination of proper restoration of the habitat of the species with support in ex situ conservation activities.\nReference information\nThe information presented here is based on the work done as part of the European Commission study on identifying the drivers of successful implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives (under contract ENV.F.1/FRA/2014/0063), carried out by the Institute for European Environmental Policy, BirdLife International, Deloitte, Denkstatt, Ecologic, ICF Consulting Services and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.

Chapter 6 draws some conclusions.  \n\n2 Agroforestry overview \n\n2.1 Definitions \n\nAgroforestry can be broadly defined as \u201ca sustainable way of land management which integrates both \n\nagricultural and forestry practices on the same land management base\u201d (Mosquera-Losada et al., \n\n2009) or as \u201ca land use practice combining trees, crops and/or livestock on the same area of land in all \nspatial or temporal arrangements\u201d (Nair, 1993). The term is defined by global and European \n\norganizations as shown in Table 2.1. \n\nTable 2.1  Some definitions of agroforestry in global and European organizations \n\nWorld Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) publications (http://outputs.worldagroforestry.org/, last \n\naccessed 30 November 2015) \n\nAgroforestry is \u201ca dynamic, ecologically based, natural resources management system that, through \nthe integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape, diversifies and sustains production \n\nfor increased social, economic and environmental benefits\u201d (Leakey, 1996). \n\nFAO (http://www.fao.org/forestry/agroforestry/80338/en/, last accessed 23 November 2015): \n\nAgroforestry is \u201ca collective name for land-use systems and technologies where woody perennials \n\n(trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used on the same land-management units as \nagricultural crops and/or animals, in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence. In \n\nagroforestry systems there are both ecological and economical interactions between the different \n\ncomponents\u201d (Lundgren and Raintree, 1982). \n\nAgroforestry can also be defined as \u201ca dynamic, ecologically based, natural resource management \nsystem that, through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape, diversifies and \n\nsustains production for increased social, economic and environmental benefits for land users at all \n\nlevels\u201d (ICRAF definition). In particular, agroforestry is crucial to smallholder farmers and other rural \npeople because it can enhance their food supply, income and health. Agroforestry systems are \n\nmultifunctional systems that can provide a wide range of economic, sociocultural, and environmental \n\nbenefits \n\nThere are three main types of agroforestry systems: \n\n\uf0b7 Agrisilvicultural systems are a combination of crops and trees, such as alley cropping or \n\nhomegardens. \n\n\uf0b7 Silvopastoral systems combine forestry and grazing of domesticated animals on pastures, \n\nrangelands or on-farm. \n\n\uf0b7 The three elements, namely trees, animals and crops, can be integrated in what are called \n\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 5 \n\nagrosylvopastoral systems and are illustrated by homegardens involving animals as well as \n\nscattered trees on croplands used for grazing after harvests. \n\nAGFORWARD Project (http://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/, last accessed 23 November \n\n2015):  \n\nAgroforestry is \u201cthe practice of deliberately integrating woody vegetation (trees or shrubs) with crop \n\nand/or animal systems to benefit from the resulting ecological and economic interactions\u201d. \n\nEuropean Agroforestry Federation (EURAF) \n\n(http://www.agroforestry.eu/AgroforestryInEurope, last accessed 23 November 2015):  \n\nAgroforestry is \u201cthe integration of woody vegetation, crops and/or livestock on the same area of land. \nTrees can be inside parcels or on the boundaries (hedges). Agroforestry can be applied to all \n\nagricultural systems, in all parts of Europe. Agroforestry systems are obtained by planting trees on \n\nagricultural land or introducing agriculture in existing woodland/orchards (e.g. silvopasture)\u201d. \n\n \n\nFrom these definitions, it must be highlighted that agroforestry areas are widespread across Europe \n\nand are not restricted to the Iberian dehesas and montados, as frequently considered. \n\nAgroforestry systems were largely developed in Europe ever since the Antiquity but declined severely \nafter the second world war, with intensification of farming practices. Most agroforestry systems have \n\nproved to provide a wide range of social and environmental benefits but also economical (see Box \n\n2.1). The biodiversity rates are often high within agroforestry lands and many provisioning, regulating \nand cultural ecosystem services are usually supplied. Agroforestry practices are also suitable for \n\nclimate change mitigation and wildfire prevention. Agroforestry is also crucial for the conservation of \n\nlivestock breeds and genetic diversity and the production of food in a sustainable way.  \n\n \n\nIn a policy context, agroforestry is \u201ca recognized practice in the ecological focus areas of the \n\nCommon Agricultural Policy (European Commission, 2013a) and as a measure in rural development \n\nprogrammes (European Commission, 2013b). It is also mentioned in the EU Forestry Strategy \n\nBox 2.1 Benefits of agroforestry systems.

(2009) \n\nas shown in Table 2.3. \n\n  \n\nTable 2.3  Agroforestry practices in Europe (Mosquera-Losada et al., 2009) \n\nAgroforestry practice Brief description \n\nSilvoarable \n\nagroforestry \n\nWidely spaced trees inter-cropped with annual or perennial crops.

It comprises forest or \n\nwoodland grazing and open forest trees. \n\n \n\n3 Mapping of agroforestry lands at the \nEuropean scale \n\nAccording to den Herder et al. (2015), \u201cin Europe there is a lack of cartographic information on the \nlocation of different types of agroforestry practices. Moreover, the information that is available is \n\nscattered and fragmented. European land cover and land use classifications have traditionally \n\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 7 \n\nseparated \u201cfarmland\u201d from \u201cforests\u201d and this in turn feeds through discrete policies and incentives \n\nwhich can cause problems both to farmers and policy makers\u201d. The scale at which agroforestry \noperates (i.e. field, farm or landscape) is also critical for mapping. \n\nSeveral attempts to map agroforestry areas or related lands at the European scale have been carried \n\nout. In first place, Corine Land Cover class 2.4.4 is \u201cagro-forestry areas\u201d, which are defined according \n\nto its nomenclature as \u201cannual crops or grazing land under the wooded cover of forestry species, \nwhere the annual crops or grazing land and fallow land cover less than 50 % of the surface; it includes \n\ncombinations of forest trees with fruit and olive trees and agricultural land shaded by carob and palm \n\ntrees\u201d. However, according to Rois-D\u00edaz et al. (2006), agroforestry areas may fall under several \nclasses of Corine Land Cover, such as \u201colive groves\u201d, \u201cpastures\u201d, \u201cannual crops associated with \n\npermanent crops\u201d, \u201cland principally occupied by agriculture, with significant areas of natural \n\nvegetation\u201d or \u201cnatural grasslands\u201d. Figure 3.1 shows the distribution of all these Corine Land Cover \nclasses to give a taste of the potential extent of agroforestry lands. \n\nFigure 3.1  Corine Land Cover (2006) classes that can potentially hold agricultural \npractices \n\n \n\nAnother mapping activity at the European Union scale is related to the High Nature Value (HNV) \n\nfarmlands (Paracchini et al., 2008; see Figure 3.2), which are defined as \u201cthose areas in Europe where \nagriculture is a major (usually the dominant) land use and where that agriculture supports, or is \n\nassociated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European \n\nconservation concern, or both\u201d (Andersen et al., 2003). According to these authors, HNV farmland \n\ncan be classified into three main types: farmland with a high proportion of semi-natural vegetation \n(Type 1); farmland dominated by low intensity agriculture or a mosaic of semi-natural and cultivated \n\nland and small-scale features (Type 2); and farmland supporting rare species or a high proportion of \n\nEuropean or World populations (Type 3). Although not all HNV farmland is agroforestry land, it is \nclear that agroforestry practices may be widespread in these extensive agricultural areas. \n\n \n\f\n \n\n \n\n8 Scoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe \n\nFigure 3.2 High Nature Value Farmland in Europe. An estimate of the distribution \n\npatterns on the basis of land cover and biodiversity data (Paracchini et al., \n2008) \n\n \n\nIn the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, a first Pan-European map of \nabundance of semi-natural vegetation (both semi-natural grasslands and woody vegetation) in \n\nagricultural land was generated using remote sensing images and available European spatial datasets \n\n(Garc\u00eda-Feced et al., 2015; see Figure 3.3). The improvement of Copernicus products \n(http://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-layers/#, last accessed 1 December 2015) and \n\nthe increasing resolution of imagery may enhance the discrimination capacity between land \n\nuses/covers and, more concretely, agroforestry areas. \n\nFigure 3.3  Abundance of semi-natural vegetation in European Union agricultural \nlands (Garc\u00eda-Feced et al., 2015). The map integrates semi-natural \n\ngrasslands and woody vegetation.  \n\n \n\nIn the EUNIS Habitat Classification, given its strict assignation rules, agroforestry lands are \ndistributed across several habitat types. Particularly, \u201cpasture woods\u201d (with a tree layer overlying \n\npasture) are included in the group \u201chabitat complexes\u201d (code X09), and are defined as \u201cthe products \n\nof historic land management systems, and represent a vegetation structure rather than being a \nparticular plant community. Typically this structure consists of large, open-grown or high forest trees \n\n(often pollards) at various densities, in a matrix of grazed grassland, heathland and/or woodland \n\nhttp://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-layers/\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 9 \n\nfloras. This habitat is most common in southern Britain, but scattered examples occur throughout the \n\nUK. Outgrown wood-pasture and mature high forest remnants occur in northern and central Europe, \nbut the number and continuity of ancient (veteran) trees with their associated distinctive saproxylic \n\n(wood-eating) fauna and epiphytic flora are more abundant in Britain than elsewhere. Component \n\nhabitat types include beech and yew woodland (G1.6 and G3.97), heathland (F4) and dry acid \n\ngrassland (E1.7). A range of native species usually predominates amongst the old trees but there may \nbe non-native species which have been planted or regenerated naturally\u201d \n\n(http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats/531, last accessed 1 December 2015). A better discrimination of \n\nagroforestry lands within the EUNIS Habitat Classification is therefore needed. On the other hand, the \nEuropean Forest Types classification (European Environment Agency, 2007) does not consider \n\nagroforestry areas strictly although grazing may be a recurrent activity in some of the defined forest \n\ntypes.  \n\nDen Herder et al. (2015) recommend that \u201cit would be good to properly include agroforestry in \n\nexisting Land Use and Land Cover classification nomenclatures, for instance in the Land Use and \n\nLand Cover Aerial Frame Survey (LUCAS)\u201d. Plieninger et al. (2015) have used LUCAS information \n\nto generate the first Pan-European map of wood-pastures and quantify their extent (see Figure 3.4). \n \n\nFigure 3.4  Distribution of wood-pastures in Europe (extracted from Plieninger et \nal., 2015): a) pastures in open woodland; b) pastures with sparse trees; \nand c) pastures with cultivated trees). Grey background indicates the \n\nsurveyed area, while areas in white remained unconsidered. Note that points \nrepresent the location but not the extent of wood-pastures as they are not at \nscale. \n\n \nOn the other hand, the Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) should provide accurate information \n\nof the different agroforestry practices within each country. \n\nOn the policy side, reporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive provides distribution maps and \n\nassesses the conservation status of habitat types every six years. Regarding wood pastures, Beaufoy et \n\nhttp://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats/531\f\n \n\n \n\n10 Scoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe \n\nal. (2015) highlight that \u201cin addition to the two types of wood pasture explicitly cited in Annex I of \n\nthe Habitats Directive (\u201c6310 Dehesas with evergreen Quercus species\u201d and \u201c9070 Fenoscandian \nwooded meadows\u201d), many types of Annex I forest habitat have a long tradition of use as wood \n\npastures, and appropriate grazing is a key tool for their conservation management in these cases, \n\nespecially where they exist in a mosaic with shrub and grass habitats. Examples include \u201c9230 \n\nGalicio-Portuguese oak woods with Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica\u201d and \u201c5210 Arborescent \nmatorral with Juniperus spp.\u201d. Hartel and Plieninger (2014) add that \u201camong the 233 European natural \n\nhabitat types listed in Annex I, no less than 65 are to some extent related to wood pasture. Of these, \n\nonly four habitat types are explicitly recognised as grazed woody formations (i.e. \u201c5130 Juniperus \ncommunis formations on heaths or calcareous grasslands\u201d, 5210, 6310 and 9070).  Figure 3.5 displays \n\nthe distribution of these habitat types and shows their conservation status in each country. \n\nFigure 3.5 Description, distribution and assessment of conservation status at the \nMember State level in some habitat types related to wood pastures. \n\nConservation status legend: Favourable (green), Unknown (grey), \nUnfavourable-inadequate (orange) and Unfavourable-bad (red). \nhttp://bd.eionet.europa.eu/article17/reports2012/habitat/summary/, last \naccessed 1 December 2015. \n\nAnnex I habitat type name and description Distribution \n\n5130 Juniperus communis formations on heaths or calcareous grasslands \n\nFormations with Juniperus communis of plain to montane levels. They mainly \n\ncorrespond to phytodynamic succession of the following types of vegetation: \n\na) generally, mesophilous or xerophilous calcareous and nutrient poor \ngrasslands, grazed or let lie fallow, of the Festuco-Brometea and Elyno\nSesleretea; b) more rarely, heathlands of the Calluno vulgaris-Ulicetea \n\nminoris. \n\n \n\n5210 Arborescent matorral with Juniperus spp. \n\nMediterranean and sub-Mediterranean evergreen sclerophyllous scrub \norganized around arborescent junipers with a high taxonomic variety: \n\nJuniperus oxycedrus, J. phoenicea, J. foetidissima, J. excelsa and J. \n\ncommunis, J. drupacea, J. thurifera. \n\n \n\n6310 Dehesas with evergreen Quercus spp. \nDehesas with evergreen Quercus species form a characteristic landscape of \n\nthe Iberian peninsula in which crops, pasture land or Meso-Mediterranean \n\nshrubby matorral (in juxtaposition or rotation) are shaded by a fairly closed to \n\nvery open canopy of native evergreen oaks (Quercus suber, Q. ilex, Q. \nrotundifolia, Q. coccifera). It is an important habitat of endangered animals. \n\nThis habitat type is only reported in the Mediterranean region Although \n\ntypical of Spain and Portugal (where this habitat is known as montado), the \nhabitat is also found locally in France and Italy. The percentage of coverage \n\nby Natura 2000 sites of this habitat type by country is 33% in Spain, 10% in \n\nItaly and unknown in Portugal. \n\n \n\nhttp://bd.eionet.europa.eu/article17/reports2012/habitat/summary/\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 11 \n\n6530 Fennoscandian wooded meadows \n\nFennoscandian wooded meadows represent a species-rich vegetation complex \nconsisting of small copses of deciduous trees and shrubs and patches of open \n\nmeadows. Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), birch (Betula pendula, B. pubescens) and \n\nQuercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus glabra or Alnus incana are the common \ntree species. Nowadays very few areas are managed but traditionally these \n\nareas were managed by a combination of raking, hay-cutting, grazing of \n\ngrassland and pollarding or lopping of trees. \n \n\n9070 Fennoscandian wooded pastures \n\nA vegetation complex in which the tree layer varies from sparse forest to \nsmall copses of trees and shrubs and patches of open grassland. These \n\nhabitats have a representative mosaic of copses of trees (usually deciduous \n\ntrees) and grassland with a long continuity of grazing. The tree layer consists \n\neither of deciduous broad-leaved species such as Quercus robur, Fraxinus \nexcelsior, Tilia cordata, Betula spp., Alnus incana or conifers (Picea abies, \n\nPinus sylvestris). Particularly in Sweden there are pastures with old, large \n\noaks.  \n\n9230 Galicio-Portuguese oak woods with Quercus robur and Quercus \n\npyrenaica \n\nThis habitat includes a varied group of forests dominated by Pyrenean oak \n(Quercus pyrenaica) from the Iberian Penninsula and southwestern France \n\nwith five regional subtypes. Quercus robur, Fraxinus angustifolia and Acer \n\ngranatense occur in the tree layer. \n\n \n\n4 Main activities at the European level \n\n4.1 AGFORWARD Project \n\nAGFORWARD (AGroFORestry that Will Advance Rural Development) is a four-year (2014-2017) \nresearch project funded by the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme for Research and \n\nTechnological Development (http://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/, last accessed 1 December \n\n2015). The overall aim of the project is to promote agroforestry practices in Europe that will advance \nrural development. The project involves two international institutions and over 23 universities, \n\nresearch and farming organisations from across Europe. The project tasks are subdivided in 9 Work \n\nPackages, namely \u201cExisting agroforestry systems in Europe\u201d (WP1), \u201cHigh Natural and Cultural \n\nValue Agroforestry\u201d (WP2), \u201cAgroforestry for High Value Tree Systems\u201d (WP3), \u201cAgroforestry for \narable farmers\u201d (WP4), \u201cAgroforestry for livestock farmers\u201d (WP5), \u201cField- and farm-scale \n\nevaluation and innovations\u201d (WP6), \u201cLandscape-scale evaluation of innovative agroforestry\u201d (WP7), \n\n\u201cAgroforestry policy development\u201d (WP8) and \u201cDissemination\u201d (WP9). \nWP1, i.e. \u201cExisting agroforestry systems in Europe\u201d, is especially relevant in relation to this scoping \n\ndocument. One of its main objectives is \u201cto inventory and explain using existing EU27 land cover and \n\nland use databases the extent and recent changes of agroforestry systems in Europe\u201d. As a result, a \n\nreport entitled \u201cPreliminary stratification and quantification of agroforestry in Europe\u201d (den Herder et \nal., 2015) has been delivered. The report is a very valuable source of information overarching all the \n\nagroforestry systems in Europe. Along with a fine introduction to the topic (definitions and \n\nclassification) and the used approach, it provides detailed lists of agroforestry systems existing in \nEuropean countries, providing as well their estimated extent based on a literature review. \n\nAgroforestry systems are classified in four target groups that are further explored in the above\nmentioned work packages 2 to 5: agroforestry of high nature and cultural value, agroforestry with \n\nhttp://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/\f\n \n\n \n\n12 Scoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe \n\nhigh value trees, agroforestry in arable systems and agroforestry practices for livestock systems. In \n\nmore detail, these are the different agroforestry systems that are included in each group: \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry of high nature and cultural: oak dominated agroforestry in the Mediterranean, \n\nother  wood pasture systems, hedgerow systems and scattered trees, and reindeer husbandry. \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry with high value trees: agroforestry with fruit trees and agroforestry with other \n\ntrees (olive, vine, pine tree, chestnut and carob tree). \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry in arable systems: linear features with trees and within-field agroforestry. \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry practices for livestock systems. \n\nThe report provides maps of the preliminary quantification of agroforestry systems of the first two \n\ngroups (Figure 4.1). \n\n \nFigure 4.1  Estimation of the extent of selected agroforestry systems in each \n\ncountry (den Herder et al., 2015) \n\n \n \n\nAnother interesting output of this project is an interactive map of agroforestry research and \n\ndemonstration in Europe, displaying the location of the project\u2019s stakeholder groups, replicated \n\nexperiments, demonstration or trial sites, other agroforestry replicated experiments and other \ndemonstration and trial sites (see Figure 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAgroforestry of high nature and cultural value \n\n \n\n \nMediterranean oak tree systems       Wood pastures and meadows          Reindeer husbandry \n\n \n\nAgroforestry with high value trees \n\n \n\n \n                   Fruit tree systems                    Olive tree systems \n\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 13 \n\nFigure 4.2  Interactive map of agroforestry research and demonstration in Europe \n\n(http://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/map-of-agroforestry-research-anddemonstration-in-europe.html, last accessed 24 November 2015) \n\n \n \n\n4.2 SAFE Project \n\nThe SAFE research Project (Silvoarable Agroforestry For Europe) was sponsored by the European \n\nUnion and coordinated by INRA (France). More than 70 scientists from eight European countries \nparticipated in the project from August 2001 to January 2005 \n\n(http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/safe/english/index.htm, last accessed 1 December 2015). In the \n\ncontext of the project, silvoarable agroforestry was defined as \u201ca land management technology where \nwidely spaced trees are intercropped with arable crops\u201d. In support of the European Common \n\nAgricultural Policy, the SAFE project provided models and databases for assessing the profitability of \n\nsilvoarable systems and suggested unified European policy guidelines for implementing agroforestry. \nThe final report of the project was delivered in May 2005 (Dupraz et al., 2005). \n\n4.3 European Agroforestry Federation (EURAF) \n\nThe European Agroforestry Federation (EURAF) aims at \u201cpromoting the use of trees on farms as well \nas any kind of silvopastoralism throughout the different environmental regions of Europe\u201d \n\n(http://www.agroforestry.eu/, last accessed 1 December 2015). EURAF has about 280 members from \n\n20 different European countries, such as Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, \nSweden, Germany, Switzerland, Greece, United Kingdom, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain \n\nand The Netherlands. EURAF also contributes to the above-mentioned AGFORWARD project by \n\n\u201cdoing in-depth policy analysis to identify the successes and understand the constraints linked to the \n\nadoption of agroforestry across Europe\u201d. The Federation also participates in the AgroFE project \n(Agroforestry for education in Europe; http://www.agrofe.eu/, last accessed 1 December 2015). The \n\nmain objective of the AgroFE project is to favour agroforestry by providing a training through \n\ntransfer of knowledge (training of farmers, advisers and trainers), which means by transforming \nresearch results into pedagogical material (preparing guide book, teaching material and training units). \n\nThe Federation promotes agroforestry by any communication means, including lobbying for \n\nagroforestry adapted policies at the European scale. In particular, \u201cEURAF accomplished that \nincentives for the promotion of agroforestry plots had been introduced to the Common Agricultural \n\nPolicy: Agroforestry practices are listed as Ecological Focus Areas and farmers can receive greening \n\npayments for such plots in pillar I (Reg.(EU) 1307/2013). The establishment of agroforestry plots can \n\nbe supported through national or regional Rural Development Programmes in pillar II \n(Reg.(EU)1305/2013)\u201d. \n\nhttp://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/map-of-agroforestry-research-and-demonstration-in-europe.html\f\n \n\n \n\n14 Scoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe \n\nEURAF has participated in agroforestry events in the Expo Milano 2015 and the United Nations \n\nClimate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris. The Federation also organizes the European \nAgroforestry Conference every two years. The first of these conferences took place in Brussels in \n\n2012 (http://www.agroforestry.eu/conferences/I_EURAFConference, last accessed 1 December \n\n2015). \n\n4.4 European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism (EFNCP) \n\nThe European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism (EFNCP) is \u201cthe only European \n\norganisation focusing on the maintenance of low-intensity livestock farming. This type of farming is \nwidespread on less productive land in many European countries, typically using semi-natural pastures \n\nand meadows. It is the most important farming for conserving biodiversity across Europe, and for \n\nother environmental services, such as managing water-catchments and preventing wild fires. EFNCP's \n\nmain focus is on low-intensity livestock farming. This type of farming makes up the majority of what \nhas become known as 'High Nature Value' farming in Europe - those types of farming that deliver the \n\nhighest levels of biodiversity and other environmental services\u201d (http://www.efncp.org/, last accessed \n\n1 December 2015). The most relevant publication of the Forum is a book that compiles the \nexperiences and perspectives of High Nature Value Farming in 35 European countries (Beaufoy (ed.), \n\n2015). The Forum\u2019s webpage also shows the projects that have been carried out in the following \n\ncountries: Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Ireland, South-Eastern Europe countries, Spain, Sweden, \nRomania and the United Kingdom.  \n\n4.5 Conferences and seminars in a European context \n\nThe European agroforestry and pastoralism associations are very active in promoting the benefits that \nthese systems provide to society and environment and advocating for policy improvements in relation \n\nto these practices. In order to show some examples of their activities, these are several EU-context \n\nseminars and conferences that have taken place during 2015: \n\n\uf0d8 The EU Policy Seminar with title \u201cEurope\u2019s wood pastures: condemned to a slow death by the \n\nCAP? A test case for EU agriculture and biodiversity policy\u201d was held in the European \n\nParliament on the 17\nth\n of November 2015.

Some conclusions and \nrecommendations extracted from the booklet of the seminar are the following: \u201cCAP Pillar I \n\ndirect payments rules and implementation discriminate against wood pastures\u201d, \u201cCAP Pillar II \n\nRural Development Programmes are not doing enough to support sustainable management of \nwood pastures\u201d, \u201call wood pastures in active farming use should be fully eligible for CAP direct \n\npayments, in EU regulations and in Member State implementation\u201d, \u201can urgent evaluation should \n\nbe undertaken of the impacts of the new CAP eligibility rules for permanent pastures and how to \n\nharmonise them with other policy areas\u201d and \u201cMember states should make full use of Rural \nDevelopment Programme (RDP) measures for supporting positive management of wood \n\npastures\u201d. The booklet also presents the perspective from Spain, Sweden, Romania, France and \n\nEngland. \n\n\uf0d8 Natura 2000 Farmland Management and Biodiversity Conference \n\n(http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/platform/events/events\nupcoming/193_natura2000_farmland_management_biodiversity_conference_en.htm, last \naccessed 30 November 2015). This Natura 2000 Biogeographical Process networking event took \n\nplace in Madrid from 29\nth\n\n of September to the 1\nst\n of October 2015. \u201cBest practice experience and \n\ncase studies from across Europe were presented to illustrate measurable results that not only lead \n\nto better Natura 2000 planning and management, but also the generation of new economic \nopportunities for rural development and better integrated policy-making. At the heart of such \n\nexamples, lie the effective relationships established between farmers, public and private \n\nlandowners, land managers and businesses. The event demonstrated how multiple benefits can be \nand are being achieved through implementation of practical and pragmatic approaches in \n\nhttp://www.agroforestry.eu/conferences/I_EURAFConference\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 15 \n\nagricultural areas within and around Natura 2000 sites, which take nature conservation objectives \n\nfully into account\u201d. \n\n\uf0d8 The European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism (EFNCP) participated in the 2015 \n\nedition of the Green Week (3-5 June 2015, Brussels; http://www.efncp.org/events/seminars\nothers/green-week-brussels2015/, last accessed 30 November 2015), which is the biggest annual \n\nconference on European environment policy. \u201cThe Forum was invited to take part in Session 4.2: \nthe support of the Common Agricultural Policy for nature-based tourism, which was organised in \n\ncollaboration with DG AGRI. They contributed to this session by presenting several examples of \n\nnature-based tourism related to pastoralism and analysing to what extent the CAP is giving \nsupport to these HNV livestock systems. The focus was put on Spain, where the Forum had run a \n\nsurvey in collaboration with the Spanish Platform for Extensive Livestock Systems and \n\nPastoralism (Plataforma por la Ganader\u00eda Extensiva y el Pastoralismo, in Spanish; \nhttp://www.ganaderiaextensiva.org/, last accessed 27 November 2015) to explore some of the \n\nexisting tourism-pastoralism initiatives. The first results of this survey have already been \n\npublished online in Spanish, and were summarised in the slideshow presented at the Green Week \n\nsession\u201d. The Spanish Platform for Extensive Livestock Systems and Pastoralism is a network of \nover 200 people and organisations committed to supporting this farming activity. Some of their \n\nlines of work focus on \u201cthe need for a coherent and effective legal framework, the need to \n\nproperly address pastoralism and grazing livestock systems on the Common Agricultural Policy \nand the social visibility and image of pastoralism and pasture-based livestock farming\u201d. \n\n5 Mapping of agroforestry lands in some \ncountries \n\nAs mentioned above, there is a lack of available maps explicitly delimiting agroforestry lands across \nEurope. However, some countries have already put in place mapping activities of specific \n\nagroforestry practices. The following are some examples from selected countries compiled from an \n\ninternet review and information available through the AGFORWARD project webpage \n\n(http://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/FarmerNetworks.html, last accessed 1 December 2015): \n\n \n\n\uf0d8 In France, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forests has launched the national plan for the \n\ndevelopment of agroforestry (Plan de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019agroforesterie, in French) during the 2\nnd\n\n \nnational conference of agroforestry (Paris, 17\n\nth\n of December 2015; \n\nhttp://agriculture.gouv.fr/stephane-le-foll-presente-le-plan-national-de-developpement-de\nlagroforesterie, last accessed 18 December 2015). This plan aims at dinamizing and promoting the \nagroforestry practices in France and internationally (see Box 5.1). In particular, Action 5.1 seeks \n\nto promote the development of agroforestry practices at the European level. \n\n \n\nBox 5.1 French national plan for the development of agroforestry (Plan de d\u00e9veloppement de \n\nl\u2019agroforesterie). The plan is comprised by 23 actions grouped in the following axes \n(http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sites/minagri/files/151215-ae-agrofesterie-v2_plan.pdf, last accessed 18 \n\nDecember 2015): \n\n1. Better knowledge of the diversity of agroforestry systems and their functioning. \n2. Improvement of the regulation and legal framework and reinforcement of the financial \n\nsupport. \n\n3. Development of the counselling, education and promotion of agroforestry. \n\n4. Improvement of the economic valorisation of the sustainable agroforestry production. \n5. Promotion and diffusion of agroforestry practices at the international level. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.efncp.org/events/seminars-others/green-week-brussels2015/\f\n \n\n \n\n16 Scoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe \n\nMany french regions are implementing projects related to agroforestry. The French Agroforestry \n\nAssociation (Association Francaise d\u2019Agroforesterie, in French, AFAF) shows in its website some \nof these regional projects (http://www.agroforesterie.fr/index.php, last accessed 1 December \n\n2015). In the AGR\u2019EAU project, the farms with agroforestry practices within the Adour-Garonne \n\nbasin have been identified. In the resulting interactive map, the search can be done by type of \n\nagroforestry system, planted species or French Department (see Figure 5.1.a). The project \nSMART (Syst\u00e8mes Mixtes Agroforestiers: cr\u00e9ation de R\u00e9f\u00e9rences Techniques & \u00e9conomiques, in \n\nFrench) provides a map of the market gardens with agroforestry practices at the national level (see \n\nFigure 5.1.b). In the region of Ile-de-France, the actions, new projects and potential areas for \nagroforestry practices have been identified (see Figure 5.1.c). The French Agroforestry \n\nAssociation is also very active in organizing events such as the first European meeting of \n\nagroforestry (Premier rencontre europeenne d\u2019agroforesterie, in French) that took place in Paris in \n2011. \n\nFigure 5.1 a) Farms with agroforestry practices and soil conservation \n\n(http://www.agroforesterie.fr/AGREAU/cartographie_AGREAU/agreau-agroforesteriecouverture-vegetale-des-sols-cartographie-des-agriculteurs-references-dans-leprogramme.php, last accessed 24 November 2015);  \nb) Market gardens with agroforestry practices \n\n(http://www.agroforesterie.fr/SMART/cartographie_SMART/smart-cartographie-desprojets.php#, last accessed 30 November 2015); \nc) Agroforestry projects in the region of Ile-de-France \n\n(http://www.agroforesterie.fr/agroforesterie-et-agriculture-durable-en-ile-de-france.php, \nlast accessed 30 November 2015) \n\na)   b)  \n\nc)  \n \n\n\uf0d8 In Spain, the Spanish Forest Map (1997-2006, scale 1:50.000) delimits the dehesas country-wide \n\n(see Figure 5.2). These unique agrosilvopastoral systems have an extraordinary ecological, \n\neconomic and cultural importance in Spain.

The \nnumbers mark the counties.  \n\n \n\n\uf0d8 In Hungary, \u201cthe term agroforestry is not widely used but there are traditional wood pasture and \n\nwood meadow systems\u201d. Wood pastures have been identified by Varga et al. (2014) (Figure 5.7).  \n\nFigure 5.7 Presence of wood pastures in Hungary (Varga et al., 2014) \n\n \n\n\uf0d8 In the United Kingdom, traditional orchards have been mapped by the UK BAP Biodiversity \nReporting and Information Group (BRIG, 2011; see Figure 5.8). Traditional orchards are \n\ndescribed as \u201cstructurally and ecologically similar to wood-pasture and parkland, with opengrown \n\ntrees set in herbaceous vegetation, but are generally distinguished from these priority habitat \n\ncomplexes by the following characteristics: the species composition of the trees, these being \nprimarily in the family Rosaceae; the usually denser arrangement of the trees; the small scale of \n\nindividual habitat patches; the wider dispersion and greater frequency of occurrence of habitat \n\npatches in the countryside. Traditional orchards include plantings for nuts, principally hazel nuts, \nbut also walnuts\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\f\n \n\n \n\nScoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe 21 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8 Distribution of traditional orchards in the UK (BRIG, 2011) \n\n \n\n6 Conclusions \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry is the integration of woody vegetation, crops and/or livestock on the same area \n\nof land. The combination of these components originates the different categories of \n\nagroforestry practices: agrisilviculture, silvopastoral, agrosilvopastoral and others. Therefore, \n\nthe widespread conception that only Iberian dehesas and montados are agroforesty areas is \n\nvery reductive. The varied forms of agroforestry are practiced throughout Europe and \n\nconsequently a change in mentality is needed. \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry lands are not properly included or neglected in the available Pan-European land \n\nuse/land cover, ecosystem and habitat classifications. Their double character of forest and \n\nagriculture land makes difficult its positioining into classifications. It would be advisable to \n\nbetter define agroforestry-related classes in the existing European datasets. \n\n\uf0b7 Although there have been some attempts to map agroforestry areas and related lands at the \n\nPan-European and national scales, there is still a lack of explicit delimitation of agroforestry \n\nareas in the majority of Europe. Mapping activities should be coordinated and harmonized \n\nacross Europe. Copernicus land monitoring products could play an important role in that \n\nrespect. \n\n\uf0b7 Several relevant projects and associative initiatives are taken place in Europe, such as the \n\nproject AGFORWARD, the European Agroforestry Federation (EURAF) and the European \n\nForum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism (EFNCP). They are very active in raising \n\nawareness about agroforestry systems and improving the knowledge base. \n\n\uf0b7 Agroforestry lands have proved their value as biodiversity-rich systems and ecosystem \n\nservices suppliers, and their suitability for climate change mitigation and wildfire prevention. \n\nTheir conservation must be a priority in European policies. With this aim, the agroforestry \n\nsector is advocating for the improvement of EU regulations and Member State \n\nimplementation, and particularly, for the revision of the CAP eligibility rules for direct \n\npayments.  \n\f\n \n\n \n\n22 Scoping document: State of agroforestry information across Europe \n\nReferences \n\nAndersen, E., Baldock, D., Bennet, H., Beaufoy, G., Bignal, E., Brower, F., Elbersen, B., Eiden, G., \n\nGodeschalk, F., Jones, G., McCracken, D.I., Nieuwenhuizen, W., van Eupen, M., Hennekes, S., and \nZervas, G., 2003.

From protected areas and green and blue infrastructure to restoration, rewilding and using nature-based solutions to climate change, much needs to be done to reverse the deterioration in the health of nature.\nProtecting nature is the first step. Biodiversity in Europe continues to decline but there have recently been positive developments for forests, mammals and birds, which are benefiting from conservation measures.\nCurrently,Birds and the Habitats Directives. At the heart of these directives is the EU\u2019s Natura 2000 network of protected areas, the largest of its kind in the world. It makes up 18 % of the EU\u2019s land area and 8 % of its marine territory.are covered by EU legislation such as the\nSome of the most valuable and threatened species and habitats in Europe are protected by Natura 2000. Protected sites contain breeding and resting places for rare and threatened species, while some rare habitats are designated as sites in themselves.\nThe target of the new EU biodiversity strategy is to increase the protected area to at least 30 % of EU land and 30 % of surrounding seas by 2030. Primary and old-growth forests and other carbon-rich ecosystems, such as peatlands and grasslands, will be the focus of conservation efforts.\n\u00a9 Mateusz Piesiak, REDISCOVER Nature /EEA,\nMoreover, the strategy calls for planting at least 3 billion trees by 2030 to support biodiversity and ecosystem restoration. More forests will also be managed to promote biodiversity-friendly practices.\nDeveloping the Trans-European Nature Network by enlarging protected areas to meet the 30 % target is part of the biodiversity strategy. Many Natura 2000 protected areas by natural and semi-natural landscapes that provide ecosystem services, such as pollination, soil fertility, flood control and recreation, and are essential for climate change mitigation and disaster risk. The Emerald Network of Areas of Special Interest, to which the EU contributes via Natura 2000, also supports the same efforts. Together, these areas form a green infrastructure network across Europe. Studies suggest that nature is better protected inside this network, which contains a greater area providing the required services and experiencing fewer ecosystem pressures.\nHowever, barriers such as roads, railways, urban areas and agricultural land fragment the landscape, limiting the movement of species and hindering the network\u2019s development. Increasing the connectivity of the network helps ensure that habitat conditions are improved, biodiversity decline is prevented and ecosystem service delivery is boosted.\nBarriers hinder the health of Europe\u2019s water bodies. There are over 1 million barriers on European rivers, including dams, weirs and sluices. Most are small and obsolete. They contribute greatly to the poor state of nature in our rivers, as many species require rivers to be free-flowing to thrive and currently the movement downstream of sediment is prevented, causing blockages and altering habitats.\nThe biodiversity strategy aims to restore at least 25 000 km of free-flowing rivers by 2030 bybased on data from 11 countries. Restoring floodplains and wetlands is also an important element of this work.By October 2020, almost 5 000 dam removals had been recorded in Europe,\nWhile the above solutions require intensively managed processes to restore nature, rewilding is a newer, more natural approach. By identifying spaces where natural processes are encouraged, it allows nature to heal so that it can start to manage on its own again. Initiatives such as Rewilding Europe are working to increase Europe\u2019s biodiversity in this way.\nToday there are eight large rewilding areas in Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden. These are home to various rewilding projects including the re-establishment of free-roaming populations of European bison in Romania\u2019s Southern Carpathians and the protection of the black and griffon vultures in the Rhodope mountains in Bulgaria.\nThe EU\u2019s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories cover about the same land area as the EU and the world\u2019s largest marine territories.\nThe EU\u2019s more than 150 overseas islands host more than 20 % of the world\u2019s coral reefs and lagoons and have a very rich biodiversity. However, these island ecosystems are also highly vulnerable to invasive species, human activities and climate change impacts.\nThe BEST initiative \u2014 biodiversity and ecosystem services in territories of European overseas \u2014 aims to support the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of ecosystem services in the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories. Currently, BEST projects support conservation efforts in EU territories around the world, from the Amazonia and Caribbean regions to the Macaronesia and Polar regions.\nThe EEA\u2019s and energy, how we develop and experience the cities we live in and how we move people and goods around.showed that, in addition to conservation measures, we need to fundamentally change the way we produce and consume food\nAgricultural activities and other land management practices exert the greatest pressure on nature, with the abandonment of grasslands having a particularly big impact on pollinators, farmland birds and semi-natural habitats. By increasing organic farming by a quarter, reducing pesticide use by half by 2030 and restoring some agricultural land to high-diversity landscapes, we will help restore biodiversity.\nUrban green spaces have been used more than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Protection of such spaces is increasing, but grey infrastructure still often dominates as urban populations grow. The biodiversity strategy calls on citizens to develop urban greening plans, and to create and connect urban parks, gardens, meadows and farms, as well as install green roofs and walls, and line streets with trees and hedges to allow biodiversity to return. Plans should also aim to eliminate pesticides and, for example, establish pollinator-friendly areas in cities.\nFinally, the European Commission has presented a zero pollution action plan, Towards zero pollution for air, water and soil. Goals include a 50 % reduction in nutrient loss by reducing the run-off of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers, while protecting soil fertility. In addition, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system will also reduce the use of pesticides.\nNote: Since 2005, the area calculation has been based on spatial data. Before 2005, tabular data were used. Many sites are designated under both the Habitats and Birds Directives. The calculation of the Natura 2000 area, which takes this overlap into account, has only been available since 2011.\nChart source: EEA indicator assessment: Natura 2000 sites designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.\nMap source: NATURA 2000 - DG ENV, compiled from databases from the Member States.

The major objectives of this document are to expose the main reasons that would \nrecommend the implementation of a European agroforestry register and propose a structure and the \nmechanisms to put it in place. \n\nThe scoping document is structured in the following chapters. Chapter 2 briefly introduces \nagroforestry and, in order to justify the needs, enumerates the benefits that a European register \nwould entail. Chapter 3 introduces the available information sources and datasets. Chapter 4 proposes \nthe guidelines for the register implementation including some general principles and the structure \nand contents that it may contain. Chapter 5 synthesizes the process to implement the register and the \nparties involved. Chapter 6 draws some conclusions. The annexes show a table of relevant \norganizations and projects, a catalogue of available agroforestry datasets and a proposed model of \nfactsheet for the register. \n\nIt must be highlighted that this scoping document is a follow-up of the ETC/BD Working paper \nN\u00b0C/2015 \u201cState of agroforestry information across Europe\u201d (Garc\u00eda Feced, 2015; \nhttp://bd.eionet.europa.eu/Reports/ETCBDTechnicalWorkingpapers/State_agroforestry_in_Europe, \nlast accessed 27 March 2016) which reviews the concept of agroforestry from a European perspective \nand presents in a synthetic way the main projects, initiatives and maps concerning agroforestry \npractices. \n\nThe author wants to acknowledge the following Spanish experts on agroforestry systems that have \nenriched this document providing relevant comments: Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez (Junta de \n\nAndaluc\u00eda), Gerardo Moreno Marcos (UNEX), Fernando Javier Pulido D\u00edaz (UNEX), Ana Rengifo \nAbbad (FEDEHESA) and Jabier Ruiz Mirazo (EFNCP).  \n\n  \n\nhttp://bd.eionet.europa.eu/Reports/ETCBDTechnicalWorkingpapers/State_agroforestry_in_Europe\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 5 \n\n2 Justification of a European register of \nagroforestry areas \n\n2.1 Definition of agroforestry \n\nAgroforestry can be broadly defined as \u201ca sustainable way of land management which integrates both \nagricultural and forestry practices on the same land management base\u201d (Mosquera-Losada et al., \n2009) or as \u201ca land use practice combining trees, crops and/or livestock on the same area of land in \nall spatial or temporal arrangements\u201d (Nair, 1993). Agroforestry is \u201cthe integration of woody \nvegetation, crops and/or livestock on the same area of land. Trees can be inside parcels or on the \nboundaries (hedges). Agroforestry can be applied to all agricultural systems, in all parts of Europe. \nAgroforestry systems are obtained by planting trees on agricultural land or introducing agriculture in \nexisting woodland/orchards (e.g. silvopasture)\u201d (European Agroforestry Federation (EURAF), \nhttp://www.agroforestry.eu/AgroforestryInEurope, last accessed 23 November 2015).  \n\nThe combination of the different components of agroforestry systems (i.e. woody vegetation, crops \nand pasture/animals) allows a broad categorization of agroforestry practices (McAdam et al., 2009): \nagrisilviculture, silvopastoral, agrosilvopastoral and others. \n \nAccording to Garc\u00eda Feced (2015), \u201cagroforestry systems were largely developed in Europe ever since \nthe Antiquity but declined severely after the Second World War, with intensification of farming \npractices. Most agroforestry systems have proved to provide a wide range of social and environmental \nbenefits but also economical (see Box 2.1). The biodiversity rates are often high within agroforestry \nlands and many provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services are usually supplied. \nAgroforestry practices are also suitable for climate change mitigation and wildfire prevention. \nAgroforestry is also crucial for the conservation of livestock breeds and genetic diversity and the \nproduction of food in a sustainable way\u201d.  \n\n \n\nBox 2.1 Benefits of agroforestry systems.

(2009) \nas: silvoarable agroforestry, forest farming, riparian buffer strips, improved fallow, multipurpose trees \n\nand silvopasture. It must be highlighted that agroforestry areas are widespread across Europe \nand are not restricted to the Iberian dehesas and montados, as frequently considered. \n \n\n2.2 Benefits of a potential register \n\nThe implementation of a European register of agroforestry areas would imply a number of advantages \nin the following aspects: \n \n\n\u2022 Compliance of EU policy requirements \n\nIn a policy context, agroforestry is \u201ca recognized practice in the ecological focus areas of the Common \nAgricultural Policy (European Commission, 2013a) and as a measure in rural development \nprogrammes (European Commission, 2013b). It is also mentioned in the EU Forestry Strategy \n(European Commission, 2013c) and as a sustainable land management practice by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014)\u201d (den Herder et al., 2015a). The availability \nof more systematized information on agroforestry areas across Europe could provide critical input to \npolicy instruments and conservation programmes. \n\nAgroforestry lands have proved their value as biodiversity-rich systems and ecosystem services \nsuppliers, and their suitability for climate change mitigation and wildfire prevention. Their \nconservation must be a priority in European policies. With this aim, the agroforestry sector is \nadvocating for the improvement of EU regulations and Member State implementation, and \nparticularly, for the revision of the CAP eligibility rules for direct payments. A conclusion from the EU \nPolicy Seminar \u201cEurope\u2019s wood pastures: condemned to a slow death by the CAP? A test case for EU \nagriculture and biodiversity policy\u201d (European Parliament, 17th of November 2015, \nhttp://www.efncp.org/events/seminars-others/wood-pastures-brussels2015/, last accessed 30 \nNovember 2015) is that \u201can urgent evaluation should be undertaken of the impacts of the new CAP \neligibility rules for permanent pastures and how to harmonise them with other policy areas\u201d. A \nregister of agroforestry areas could help to evaluate these impacts. \n\nAn objective of the European Union Forest Strategy adopted by the European Commission (COM 2013 \n(659 final)) is to improve the knowledge about forest ecosystems and a register could be very useful \nto understand better these systems where forest and farmland are interlinked. \n\nThe activities under the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES, Target 2 \nof the EU Biodiversity Strategy towards 2020) could also profit of a register given the high rate of \nregulating ecosystem services that these areas provide.  \n\nPolicy instruments such as the EU Habitats and Birds Directives and Natura 2000 network would \nstrongly benefit from the inputs provided by a register. For instance, the information could be useful \nfor providing distribution maps, assessing the conservation status of habitat types and species, and \nreporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive and Article 12 of the Birds Directive every six years. \nRegarding wood pastures, Beaufoy (ed.) (2015) highlight that \u201cin addition to the two types of wood \npasture explicitly cited in Annex I of the Habitats Directive (\u201c6310 Dehesas with evergreen Quercus \nspecies\u201d and \u201c9070 Fenoscandian wooded meadows\u201d), many types of Annex I forest habitats have a \nlong tradition of use as wood pastures, and appropriate grazing is a key tool for their conservation \nmanagement in these cases, especially where they exist in a mosaic with shrub and grass habitats.  \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 7 \n\nThe LIFE programme finances conservation activities which are sometimes located in agroforestry \nareas. Thus the register and mapping could be a tool to prioritize conservation and restoration \nactivities. \n\nIn a global context, a register and mapping of agroforestry areas could provide useful inputs to the \nConvention on Biological Diversity assessments and the instruments for climate change mitigation \n(following 2015 Climate Convention in Paris). \n\n\u2022 Potential links to FISE \n\nThe Forest Information System for Europe (FISE) includes \u201cnot only European information on forests, \nbut also all the relevant information on forests at the global scale that influences forests and forestry \n\nactivities in Europe\u201d (http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/, last accessed 31 March 2016). This initiative is \nconducted by a group of scientist from research institutions such as the Joint Research Centre. The \ncreation that such a system is an objective of the European Union Forest Strategy (COM 2013 (659 \nfinal)) by the European Commission. \n\nThe website of the system is accessible at http://fise.jrc.ec.europa.eu (last accessed 31 March 2016). \nThe activities in FISE are organized in four modules dealing with: Forest Disturbances, Forest \nEcosystem Services, Forest and the EU Bio-economy, Forests and climate change.  \n\nGiven that agroforestry practices are both forestry and agriculture, for the implementation of the \nregister (see Chapter 5) it is proposed that FISE plays a role on the delivery of information of the \nregister at the European level. A number of meetings between EIONET parties (EEA and ETCs) and the \nEuropean Commission (in particular, the JRC, DG ENV and DG AGRI) should be organized to set the \nguidelines and the mechanisms to include the register in FISE. \n \n\n\u2022 Improvement of classifications and mapping of land uses/covers and habitats \n\nTwo of the conclusions of the review made by Garc\u00eda Feced (2015) are that \u201cagroforestry lands are \nnot properly included or neglected in the available Pan-European land use/land cover, ecosystem and \nhabitat classifications. Their double character of forest and agriculture land makes difficult their \npositioning into classifications. It would be advisable to better define agroforestry-related classes in \nthe existing European datasets\u201d and that \u201calthough there have been some attempts to map \nagroforestry areas and related lands at the Pan-European and national scales, there is still a lack of \nexplicit delimitation of agroforestry areas in the majority of Europe. Mapping activities should be \ncoordinated and harmonized across Europe. Copernicus land monitoring products could play an \nimportant role in that respect\u201d. \n\nAccording to den Herder et al. (2015a), \u201cin Europe there is a lack of cartographic information on the \nlocation of different types of agroforestry practices. Moreover, the information that is available is \nscattered and fragmented. European land cover and land use classifications have traditionally \nseparated \u201cfarmland\u201d from \u201cforests\u201d and this in turn feeds through discrete policies and incentives \nwhich can cause problems both to farmers and policy makers\u201d. The scale at which agroforestry \noperates (i.e. field, farm or landscape) is also critical for mapping. \n\nA register of agroforestry areas could improve land use/cover and habitat classifications and \nenvironmental mapping Europe-wide. \n\nFirstly, Corine Land Cover could be enhanced using the inputs of an agroforestry areas register, in \nparticular class 2.4.4 which represents \u201cagro-forestry areas\u201d. However, according to Rois-D\u00edaz et al. \n(2006), agroforestry areas may fall under several classes of Corine Land Cover, such as \u201colive groves\u201d, \n\nhttp://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 8 \n\n\u201cpastures\u201d, \u201cannual crops associated with permanent crops\u201d, \u201cland principally occupied by \nagriculture, with significant areas of natural vegetation\u201d or \u201cnatural grasslands\u201d. A register could help \nto discriminate better the lands where agroforestry practices are taking place. \n\nA classification that could also be benefited by a register is the EUNIS, which is a habitat classification \nbut considers as well some aspects related to management. In EUNIS, given its strict assignation rules, \nagroforestry lands are distributed across several habitat types. Particularly, \u201cpasture woods\u201d (with a \ntree layer overlying pasture) are included in the group \u201chabitat complexes\u201d (code X09). On the other \nhand, the European Forest Types classification (European Environment Agency, 2007) does not \nconsider agroforestry areas strictly although grazing may be a recurrent activity in some of the defined \nforest types. \n\nAs mentioned above, there are several Annex I habitat types related to agroforestry practices. The \ndistribution maps of these habitat types included in the Habitats Directive (European Commission, \n2013d) could also be enhanced by an improved identification and understanding of agroforestry areas. \nGiven the high biodiversity rates usually existing in these areas, distribution maps of flora and fauna \nspecies could be refined, helping as well to identify and assess the status of red list species. \n\nFurthermore, the assessment and mapping of High Nature Value (HNV) farmlands (Paracchini et al., \n2008) would also be benefited by a proper delimitation of agroforestry areas.  \n\nThe improvement of Copernicus products (http://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolutionlayers/#, last accessed 1 December 2015) and the increasing resolution of imagery may enhance the \ndiscrimination capacity between land uses/covers. Copernicus images and processed outputs could \nthus be instrumental for the identification and mapping of agroforestry areas. In more detail and \nproviding 3D data, LIDAR can also be a very useful tool for the inventorying and measurement of \nagroforestry areas attributes. \n\nDen Herder et al. (2015a) recommend that \u201cit would be good to properly include agroforestry in \nexisting Land Use and Land Cover classification nomenclatures, for instance in the Land Use and Land \nCover Aerial Frame Survey (LUCAS)\u201d. Plieninger et al. (2015) have used LUCAS information to generate \nthe first Pan-European map of wood-pastures and quantify their extent. \n\nIt must be highlighted that, under the framework of the project AGFORWARD, a relevant report has \nbeen elaborated where \u201cthe agroforestry areas of Europe were primarily mapped using LUCAS. The \nCopernicus Land Monitoring Survey (high resolution maps with tree cover density) was also used to \nestimate tree cover on agricultural land in seven countries (Austria, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Sweden and Norway). Both sets of results were compared with a review of the literature \nand statistical inventories\u201d (den Herder et al., 2015b). \n\nOn the other hand, the Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) can help creating a Pan-European \nregister by providing accurate information of the different agroforestry lands within each country. \n\n\u2022 Delimitation of protected lands and Natura 2000 areas \n\nMany agroforestry areas are included within Natura 2000 and other protected lands. A register and \nmapping of these areas can enhance the selection of new priority areas for protection and the design \nof adequate conservation measures. \n \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 9 \n\n\u2022 Update of indicators \n\nSome SEBI indicators could benefit of the inputs of a register of agroforestry areas, specially the SEBI \n020 Agriculture: area under management practices potentially supporting biodiversity, which is based \non the estimated High Nature Value (HNV) farmland presence in Europe. Other SEBI indicators that \ncould indirectly benefit from a register are: SEBI 001Abundance and distribution of selected species, \nSEBI 002 Red List Index for European species, SEBI 003 Species of European interest, SEBI 005 Habitats \nof European interest, SEBI and 008 Sites designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives \n(accessible at http://biodiversity.europa.eu/topics/sebi-indicators, last accessed 31 March 2016).   \nThe following CMEF (Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; DG AGRI, 2015) Context \nIndicators are also related to agroforestry areas: C.34 Natura 2000 area, C.35 Farmland Bird Index \n(FBI), C.36 Conservation status of agricultural habitats (grassland) and C.37 HNV (high nature value) \nfarming. The ETC/BD scoping document \u201cBiodiversity indicators related to agriculture\u201d (Garc\u00eda Feced \nand Cond\u00e9, 2015) provides an overview of these CMEF indicators.  \n \n\n\u2022 Encouragement of national initiatives \n\nThe creation of a Pan-European register can have a positive effect on countries to study better their \nagroforestry areas and put in place the tools and measures to protect them. \n\n\u2022 Improvement of the European research network and knowledge transfer \n\nUnderstanding the processes and functions occurring in these agroforestry areas has always drawn \nthe attention of the researchers. Yet, there is still much to understand of these complex systems. The \nproper mapping of these spaces could help identifying pilot areas that could be investigated in deep. \nThe design and implementation of a register could also strength collaborative efforts between \nresearch institutes, consortia and universities across Europe. The European Union has funded some \nresearch projects with this aim. \n\nFor instance, AGFORWARD (AGroFORestry that Will Advance Rural Development) is a four-year (20142017) research project funded by the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme with the \noverall aim of promoting agroforestry practices in Europe. The project involves two international \ninstitutions and over 23 universities, research and farming organisations from across Europe. \n \n\n\u2022 Participation of agroforestry organizations and environmental ONGs \n\nThroughout Europe there is an increasing interest in protecting these areas and the ancestral practices \nthey are derived from. Several relevant associative initiatives are taken place in Europe, such as the \nEuropean Agroforestry Federation (EURAF) and the European Forum on Nature Conservation and \nPastoralism (EFNCP) (see Annex 1 for more details on the main projects and organizations related to \nagroforestry in Europe). They are very active in promoting the benefits that these systems provide to \nsociety and the environment and advocating for policy improvements in relation to these practices. A \ngood example of the latter is the \u201cWood pastures manifesto for urgent change to the CAP\u201d \n(http://www.efncp.org/policy/wood-pastures-manifesto/, last accessed 23 April 2016) that the EFNCP \nhas launched. \n  \n\nhttp://biodiversity.europa.eu/topics/sebi-indicators\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 10 \n\n3 Available information sources and datasets \n\nAs mentioned above, the ETC/BD Working paper N\u00b0C/2015 \u201cState of information of agroforestry \nareas\u201d (Garc\u00eda Feced, 2015) reviews the existing and available information sources related to \nagroforestry areas at European, national and regional scale. This synthesis showed that information is \nstill scarce and an effort must be done to typify and map agroforestry systems in Europe. \n\nBased on Garc\u00eda Feced (2015), Annex 2 provides a catalogue of the available datasets and maps \npresented in standardized factsheets that collect the following information: Coverage (continental, \nnational or regional), Dataset title, Original title (in original language if different than English), Source \n(main provider of information), Classes (types of agroforestry areas or legend of map), Shape/Spatial \nresolution (if the map has a point or polygon shape, and resolution), Year (of dataset creation), \nAvailability (GIS files, map viewer, only tables or images), Definition/Criteria/Indicators (used to \ndistinguish the agroforestry area), Main reference, Main webpage and Map image. \n\nThe catalogue of datasets and maps is useful for determining the availability of sources and databases \nfrom which a register could be populated. These standardised forms can be filled in with existing or \nnew datasets. \n  \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 11 \n\n4 Guidelines for a register of agroforestry areas \n\nAs mentioned above, there is a lack of available explicit information on agroforestry areas across \nEurope. However, some countries have already created partial registers in certain regions.  \n \nFrance is a very active country in the promotion of agroforestry practices. The French Ministry of \nAgriculture, Food and Forests has launched the national plan for the development of agroforestry \n(Plan de d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019agroforesterie, in French) during the 2nd national conference of \nagroforestry (Paris, 17th of December 2015; http://agriculture.gouv.fr/stephane-le-foll-presente-leplan-national-de-developpement-de-lagroforesterie, last accessed 18 December 2015). This plan aims \nat dinamizing and promoting the agroforestry practices in France and internationally. In particular, \nAction 5.1 seeks to promote the development of agroforestry practices at the European level \n(http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sites/minagri/files/151215-ae-agrofesterie-v2_plan.pdf, last accessed 18 \nDecember 2015). In France, several registers and mapping activities at the national and regional levels \nhave been carried out. A relevant example is the AGR\u2019EAU Project, which aims at identifying the farms \nwith agroforestry practices and soil conservation in the Adour-Garonne basin. Factsheets of pilot \nfarms have been produced (see Figure 4.1 for example factsheets) with information about their uses \nand covers, management, history or pedoclimatic conditions. \n\nFigure 4.1 Examples of factsheets of pilot farms in the AGR\u2019EAU Project \n(http://www.agroforesterie.fr/AGREAU/agreau-reseau-fermes-pilotesagroforesterie-couverts-vegetaux.php, last accessed 24 April 2016) \n\n \n\nIn Spain, an example of a regional register of agroforestry areas is the \u201cCenso de Dehesas de \nAndaluc\u00eda\u201d (Decreto 70/2012, de 20 de marzo, Bolet\u00edn Oficial Junta de Andaluc\u00eda n\u00fam. 63). Given the \nimportance of the dehesas in this region, they are regulated by their own Law (Ley 7/2010, de 14 de \njulio, para la Dehesa, Bolet\u00edn Oficial Junta de Andaluc\u00eda n\u00fam. 144), which contemplates the creation \nof a register. Plans and measures to manage, protect and study these areas are also established in the \nlaw.  \n\nThese guidelines may not be common to all the regions or agroforestry areas of Europe but could be \nused as a reference to set criteria and indicators in a more systematic manner across Europe. \n\nhttp://agriculture.gouv.fr/stephane-le-foll-presente-le-plan-national-de-developpement-de-lagroforesterie\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 12 \n\nA register of agroforestry areas at the European scale must contain the basic information to identify \nthem and the main characteristics of the different types of agroforestry practices. As Garc\u00eda Feced \n(2015) showed, the availability of information is very uneven across countries and therefore the \nregister must also contemplate certain flexibility subjected to availability.  \n\nThus, the fields that are proposed for the creation of a register of agroforestry areas are organized in \nthree sections: basic information of the agroforestry area, main practices and other interesting \ninformation. Annex 3 shows a proposed model of factsheet containing these fields. \n\nThe basic information to identify the farm includes: Region/Country, Farm name, Property, Geolocation, GIS availability, Source(s), Reference(s)/Webpage(s) and Register date (and identification \nnumber). In most cases, these fields will be associated to the information collected in the dataset \nfactsheets that have been previously mentioned. \n\nIt is also needed to register the main practices of these farms. The following fields are proposed: Type \nof agroforestry practice, Total area, Protected area, Main tree species and cover, Presence of old trees, \nMain crop/s and area, Main grassland species and area and Main livestock species and number.  \n\nAgroforestry systems are varied and fall into different categories depending on their structure and \nmain components (i.e. distribution of the silvo, agro and pastoral element). Although the term \n\u201cagroforestry\u201d can be used as an umbrella for all types of agroforestry practices, further \ndifferentiation is needed. It must be highlighted that if a register were to be used for policy purposes, \ntypes could not be mixed. For instance, dehesas have different particularities and problematic than \nwood pastures. At least it is recommended to distinguish between lands with extensive or pastoral \npractices and lands that have been planted or have an intensive management. \n\nThe total area (in ha) of the exploitation is important for the calculation of indicators as expressed \nabove. This information could be extracted using geospatial techniques or ancillary maps of land uses \nand cover. Satellite images as obtained from Copernicus programme may be very useful for calculating \nareas. It is also useful to specify if the area is protected and under which policy instruments. \n\nA register must contain the main species of the different components of the agroforestry area, i.e. the \nmain tree species, the main crop/s, the main grassland species and the main livestock species. In each \nof these components, it must be respectively specified the cover (in percentage), the area (in ha) or \nthe number. In the case of the tree component, it is interesting to note if there are old trees present. \n\nA third component of the register could be more open and generically referred as \u201cOther interesting \ninformation\u201d. Depending on availability of information, some fields could be added to the factsheets, \nsuch as Farm history, Farm management, CAP eligibility, Main activities/products, Biodiversity \nindicators, Representative and/or threatened flora and fauna species, Pedoclimatic conditions, Map \nimage or Farm picture/s. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 13 \n\n5 Implementation of the register \n\nThe register must be implemented systematically. The proposed flow of information is shown in Figure \n5.1.  \n \n\nFigure 5.1 Basic process for the implementation of a register \n\n \n \nAmong the alternative and complementary sources of information can be highlighted the local or \nregional rural administrations that collect first-hand data, the academia and research institutions \ncarrying out projects focusing on agroforestry practices (e.g. AGFORWARD or SAFE), the pre-existing \nEuropean agroforestry networks (e.g. EURAF, EFNP), the national agroforestry associations (e.g. AFAF, \nthe Spanish Platform for Extensive Livestock Systems and Pastoralism, FEDEHESA) and environmental \nONGs. These institutions and stakeholders should gather the information in as homogeneously as \npossible, using factsheets similar to the one proposed. At least a number of fields must necessarily be \nfilled-in. All the information already existing must be also transformed into these templates in order \nto be later used. National Rural Administrations must centralize and collect all the information and \ngenerate national databases and maps about these areas. It must be noted that some countries such \nas France (e.g. AGR\u2019EAU Project) and Spain (e.g. Censo de Dehesas de Andaluc\u00eda) have already created \nregisters of agroforestry areas in certain regions. \n\nThe European environment information and observation network (EIONET) has an instrumental role \non the collection and harmonisation of the datasets provided by the countries and other parties. \nEIONET is a partnership network of the European Environment Agency (EEA) and its member and \ncooperating countries. It consists of the EEA itself, six European Topic Centres (ETCs) and a network \nof around 1000 experts from 39 countries in over 350 national environment agencies and other bodies \ndealing with environmental information. These are the National Focal Points (NFPs) and the National \nReference Centres (NRCs). EIONET must benefit of this large knowledge network to coordinate and \nharmonize the European register. In the case of trans-national projects developed by consortia or \ninitiatives such as the AGFORWARD project, EIONET may also be instrumental for the collection and \nharmonisation of the data. \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 14 \n\nThe information contained in the register may be delivered at the European level using an ad-hoc \nplatform included in EIONET. It could also be incorporated to the Forest Information System of Europe \n(FISE-JRC), mentioned above, which is an objective of the EU Forest Strategy.  Another alternative is \nthat the information could also be allocated in an ad-hoc platform administrated by DG AGRI or DG \nENV services. In all cases, an appropriate infrastructure and powerful servers to store and display a \nlarge amount of data and maps (maybe interactively) are needed. \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 15 \n\n6 Conclusions \n\n\u27a2 The creation of a European register of agroforesty areas can be justified by the benefits that \n\nit would entail in the compliance of EU policy requirements (including potential links to FISE\nJRC), the improvement of mapping and classifications, the delimitation of protected land, the \n\nupdate of indicators, the encouragement of national initiatives, the knowledge transfer and \n\nthe satisfaction of societal demands. \n\n\u27a2 The available datasets related to agroforestry reviewed in ETC/BD Working Paper N\u00b0C/2015 \n\n(Garc\u00eda Feced, 2015) and catalogued in this scoping document are useful to explore the \n\ninformation sources from which the register could be populated. \n\n\u27a2 In order to create an harmonised register, a model of factsheet with needed fields is proposed. \n\nThese fields contain basic information to identify the agroforestry area, data of the main \n\nagroforestry practices and other interesting information. \n\n\u27a2 The implementation of a register must be a collaborative effort with the involvement of  \n\ninstitutions and stakeholder at all levels. An organized framework of information sources, \n\nnational administrations, EIONET and FISE-JRC is recommended. \n\f\n \n\nScoping document - Justification and guidelines for a European register of agroforestry areas 16 \n\nReferences in the main text \n\nBeaufoy, G.

HNV farmland can be classified into three main \ntypes: farmland with a high proportion of semi-natural vegetation \n(Type 1); farmland dominated by low intensity agriculture or a mosaic \nof semi-natural and cultivated land and small-scale features (Type 2); \nand farmland supporting rare species or a high proportion of European \nor World populations (Type 3). Although not all HNV farmland is \nagroforestry land, it is clear that agroforestry practices may be \nwidespread in these extensive agricultural areas. \n\nMain reference Paracchini, M.

Regarding wood pastures, Beaufoy et al. (2015) \nhighlight that \u201cin addition to the two types of wood pasture explicitly \ncited in Annex I of the Habitats Directive (\u201c6310 Dehesas with \nevergreen Quercus species\u201d and \u201c9070 Fenoscandian wooded \nmeadows\u201d), many types of Annex I forest habitat have a long tradition \nof use as wood pastures, and appropriate grazing is a key tool for their \nconservation management in these cases, especially where they exist \nin a mosaic with shrub and grass habitats. Examples include \u201c9230 \nGalicio-Portuguese oak woods with Quercus robur and Quercus \npyrenaica\u201d and \u201c5210 Arborescent matorral with Juniperus spp.\u201d. \nHartel and Plieninger (2014) add that \u201camong the 233 European natural \nhabitat types listed in Annex I, no less than 65 are to some extent \nrelated to wood pasture. Of these, only four habitat types are explicitly \nrecognised as grazed woody formations (i.e. \u201c5130 Juniperus \ncommunis formations on heaths or calcareous grasslands\u201d, 5210, 6310 \nand 9070).  \n\nMain reference Garc\u00eda Feced, C., 2015.

It is an important habitat of endangered animals. \nThis habitat type is only reported in the Mediterranean region Although \ntypical of Spain and Portugal (where this habitat is known as montado), the \nhabitat is also found locally in France and Italy. The percentage of coverage by \nNatura 2000 sites of this habitat type by country is 33% in Spain, 10% in Italy \nand unknown in Portugal. \n\n \n\n6530 Fennoscandian wooded meadows \nFennoscandian wooded meadows represent a species-rich vegetation \ncomplex consisting of small copses of deciduous trees and shrubs and patches \nof open meadows. Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), birch (Betula pendula, B. \npubescens) and Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus glabra or Alnus incana are \nthe common tree species. Nowadays very few areas are managed but \ntraditionally these areas were managed by a combination of raking, haycutting, grazing of grassland and pollarding or lopping of trees.  \n\n9070 Fennoscandian wooded pastures \nA vegetation complex in which the tree layer varies from sparse forest to small \ncopses of trees and shrubs and patches of open grassland. These habitats have \na representative mosaic of copses of trees (usually deciduous trees) and \ngrassland with a long continuity of grazing. The tree layer consists either of \ndeciduous broad-leaved species such as Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, \nTilia cordata, Betula spp., Alnus incana or conifers (Picea abies, Pinus \nsylvestris). Particularly in Sweden there are pastures with old, large oaks.  \n\n9230 Galicio-Portuguese oak woods with Quercus robur and Quercus \npyrenaica \nThis habitat includes a varied group of forests dominated by Pyrenean oak \n(Quercus pyrenaica) from the Iberian Penninsula and southwestern France \nwith five regional subtypes.

The EEA \nreport: \n\u2022 Introduces the NBS concept as an umbrella term covering a range of established nature-based \n\napproaches which aim to increase resilience to climate change; and providing an overview of current \ndefinitions and applications of NBS for CCA and DRR; \n\n\u2022 Explores how NBS are mainstreamed across the relevant policy frameworks at international and EU \nlevels that drive climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction; \n\n\u2022 Presents the main elements of the increased knowledge base about NBS (in different sectors and \nthematic areas: water, forests and forestry, agriculture, urban and coastal areas) and highlights the \nmain opportunities and limitations for NBS implementation; \n\n\u2022 Describes solutions and practical measures in selected European NBS practical cases (case studies) in \ndifferent sectors and thematic areas; and \n\n\u2022 Provides an overview of relevant financing instruments for NBS for CCA and DRR in Europe. \n \nThe EEA report stresses the importance of assessment methods including evaluation frameworks and \nmonitoring mechanisms to assess NBS performance (e.g., quantifying multiple benefits and trade-offs of \nNBS) and to improve mainstreaming into regulations, norms and plans, for example, by the use of agreed \nstandards, targets and indicators. Although a systematic review of assessment methods  was not among \nits specific objectives, the EEA report highlights the lack of structured information on this topic. For \nexample, only about 15% of the NBS case studies analysed appear to employ monitoring and/or evaluation \nand this is often limited to the duration of the NBS project or initiative. The generation and dissemination \nof monitoring and evaluation data on NBS performances are, however, vital to better inform the \ndevelopment of policies aiming to mainstream NBS in land management and urban development. The \npaucity of detailed and standardised assessment methods, reporting protocols and (technical) guidance \ndescribes a major challenge for up-scaling and replication of NBS, which was also emphasised by the \nrecently published H2020 publication \u2018Evaluating the impact of nature-based solutions: A handbook for \npractitioners' (EC, 2021a) and by other international literautre on NBS for CCA and DRR (Donatti, et al., \n2021; Vouk, Pilechi, Provan, & Enda, 2021). \n \n\n1.2 Objectives, scope and key target groups \n \nThe objective of this report is to provide a concise overview of available NBS assessment frameworks in \nthe context of adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction, based on the information from \nliterature and selected European cases. It looks at the potential and realised application of assessment \nframeworks for NBS in both ex-ante and ex-post phases as well as during implementation, generating \noutput metrics in support of policy and decision-making as well as of practitioners' work. The report may \nalso be used as guidance for the selection of an appropriate assessment approach for the various purposes \nwithin NBS projects. \n \nThe target audience of this technical paper is composed of policy-makers, decision-makers and \npractitioners at the European, national and subnational levels who work with NBS in the context of CCA \nand DRR. The paper provides information on available assessment frameworks for NBS, linking to the entry \npoints in CCA and DRM cycle (disaster risk management cycle), and highlights key considerations around \nmethod choice and application. It does not aim to be a comprehensive or detailed guide for carrying out \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/nature-based-solutions-in-europe\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 9 \n\nNBS assessments. Instead, it links to additional material available for further exploration and technical \nmethodological guidance, such as (EC, 2021a), (Donatti, et al., 2021), the research and demonstration \ninvestments into NBS interventions within Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe-funded research projects (EC, \n2020b) and the EC information website on NBS (EC, n.d.), which provide relevant insights and serve as key \nreferences for our more concise analysis. \n \n\n1.3 Structure and methodology \n \nThe report consists of two main parts. The first theoretical part looks at the reasoning behind and purpose \nof carrying out NBS assessments and the available methodological approaches matching decision-makers' \nneeds. The second part looks at real-world lessons learned concerning successes and challenges in working \nwith NBS assessment and illustrate a range of different NBS assessment approaches applied in Europe. \n \nMore specifically, the report is formed by four chapters. First, Chapter 1 provides a common background \non NBS assessment terminologies used in the report (Section 1.4) and policy links (Section 1.5), based on \nthe outcome of the recently published EEA report N\u00b0 1/2021 (EEA, 2021). This chapter is followed by \nChapter 2, which aims to devise an overarching framework for strategic planning of NBS assessment in the \ncontext of CCA and DRR. To that end, this chapter discusses key success factors and limitations of NBS \nassessments identified in existing literature (Section 2.1) and develops a step-wise framework for \ndesigning a NBS assessment (Section 2.2), accounting for the specific purposes for which NBS assessments \ncan be undertaken in the CCA and DRR contexts, the additional synergistic purposes these assessments \nmay serve as well as the key methodological characteristics that guide the assessment design and the final \nchoice of the best suited approach. Chapter 3 focuses on the analysis of existing real-life NBS assessments \nimplemented across the European Union (EU)1. These NBS case studies provide insights into the extent to \nwhich the identified assessment approaches (Chapter 2) have been applied and the context in which the \nassessments are chosen, designed and implemented, and what role assessment have played in decisionmaking. The case study analysis builds upon previous work done for the EEA report N\u00b0 1/2021 (EEA, 2021) \nbut case studies are explored from a different angle for this report focusing on the practice and experience \ninvolved in applying assessments at different stages of the NBS project cycle. A selection of case studies \nwhere specific assessment frameworks or actions have been implemented are discussed in more detail \n(Section 3.3). The paper concludes in Chapter 4 with a reflection on key elements for designing and \nimplementing NBS assessments drawn from the insights gained in this study. \n \nAn informal advisory group of representatives of different DGs of the European Commission and experts \nin various NBS related fields was set up to support, since the formulation of the extended outline, and \nreview the development of this report. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n1 We note, that NBS projects from outside the EU (e.g., Global South) may help to further inform the uptake of NBS for CCA and \nDRR initiatives in Europe, however, due to the scope of this study, we did not include in-depth analysis of international case \nstudies, but have taken account for lessons learnt from international literature in the development of the theoretical backbone \nof this study. \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/nature-based-solutions-in-europe\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 10 \n\n1.4 Terms and definitions \n \n\n1.4.1 NBS as an umbrella concept \n \nThe scientific literature and prevailing policy discourse largely frame NBS as an \u2018umbrella concept\u2019 for all \nestablished ecosystem-based approaches aiming to address societal challenges by working with nature \n(e.g., ecosystem-based approaches, sustainable forest management, green infrastructure) (IUCN, 2016; \nNessh\u00f6ver, et al., 2017). Commonly used definitions are provided by the International Union for \nConservation of Nature (IUCN) and European Commission (EC). The IUCN defines NBS as \u201cactions to \nprotect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges \neffectively and adaptively, simultaneously provide human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d (IUCN, \n2016). The EC recognizes NBS as solutions to societal challenges that are inspired and supported by nature, \nwhich are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help \nbuild resilience by bringing more and diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, \nlandscape and seascapes (EC, n.d.; EC, 2015). \n \nThe NBS concept is based on a scientific understanding of functioning ecosystems and their services to \nhuman society (i.e., supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural). NBS must therefore benefit \nbiodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services (EC, n.d.). The principles and \nsafeguards included in the \u2018Voluntary guidelines for the design and effective implementation of \necosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction\u2019 (CBD, 2019) apply \nalso for NBS. These approaches aim to manage land, water, sea and living resources in a way that promotes \nconservation and sustainable use in a holistic and equitable way. Thus, management that harness \necological processes and do not support biodiversity, such as planting non-native monoculture, genetic \nengineering or intensive farming, are more vulnerable to environmental change in the long term and are \nnot considered an ecosystem-based approach, and thus do not qualify as sound/effective NBS ( (Seddon, \net al., 2020a); (UNDRR, 2021)). \n \nThis report focuses on the NBS and related approaches in the context of climate change adaptation and \ndisaster risk reduction, hence aiming to increase resilience to climate change. The approaches relating to \nNBS for CCA and DRR have developed from a variety of backgrounds and can be categorised as follows: \n\u2022 Ecosystem approach (EA) and ecosystem-based approaches (EbAp); \n\u2022 Ecosystem protection and restoration approaches: sustainable forest management (SFM), sustainable \n\nmanagement (SM), ecosystem-based management (EbM); \n\u2022 Infrastructure-related approaches: green infrastructure (GI), blue-green infrastructure (BGI); \n\u2022 Issue-specific ecosystem-related approaches: \n\n- Climate change adaptation: ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA); \n- Flooding: natural water retention measures (NWRM); \n- Disaster risk reduction: ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR); \n- Climate mitigation: sustainable climate actions (SCA), natural climate solutions (NCS) (Figure 1, for \n\na detailed analysis see EEA (2021)). \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 11 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 12 \n\nNBS encompasses a wide range of interventions including conservation and restoration of ecosystems \n(e.g., floodplain restoration, protection of intact forests), sustainable management and climate-proofing \nof ecosystems (e.g., agroforestry, sustainable forest management), and creation of new, engineered \necosystems for reducing the impact of climate change (e.g., green buildings, green dykes, vegetated \nlevees) (Figure 2) (Eggermont, et al., 2015; EEA, 2021).  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4.2 Key elements and terms of \u2018NBS assessments\u2019 used in this report \n \nNBS assessments are essential to operationalize the concept. They enable to measure the \u2018success\u2019 of an \nindividual NBS project (e.g., how does the NBS project perform or how effective is the NBS in addressing \nclimate change or other hazard impacts) and to optimise future management and policy making (EC, \n2021a). The report uses the following terms in this context: \n\u2022 An assessment refers to a wide variety of approaches, methods or tools that can be used for a critical \n\nevaluation of information, to inform decisions on complex, public issues. In case of assessments that \nlink science and policy, \u201cassessment is defined as a process through which scientist, decision-makers \nand advocates interact to define relevant questions or issues, mobilize experts and expertise and \nprovide options for decision-makers to consider\u201d (MEA, 2005). \n\n\u2022 \u201cEvaluation is a periodic, objective assessment of a planned, ongoing or completed NBS project and \nanswers specific questions related to design, implementation and results\u201d (EC, 2021a). \n\n\u2022 Monitoring is the \u201cprocess of systematically collecting and analysing data and information in order to \ndetect signs of change in relation to baseline\u201d (GIZ, UNEP-WCMC and FEBA, 2020). With regard to NBS, \nmonitoring can be described by the continuous process that can track the implementation, measure \nthe NBS performance against expected results and/or compared with measurements of a reference \nsituation or/and towards certain target (EC, 2021a). \n\n\u2022 \u201cAssessment approaches\u201d in this report is used to denote different (combinations of) methods to \nevaluate, value or monitor NBS. \n\n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 13 \n\nThere are different entry points for an NbS assessment within CCA and disaster risk management2 (DRM) \nplanning cycles (see Figure 5 and Figure 6 in Section 2.2.1), which relate to and guide the purpose of the \nNbS assessment \u2013 the decision, process or policy it aims to inform (Section 2.2.1). In relation to NbS \nplanning and implementation process, the assessments may be categorised as ex-ante (i.e., before NbS is \nimplemented; decision support assessments for the selection and design of NbS and assessment of \npotential impact), operational phase (i.e., during NbS implementation/operation) and ex-post (i.e., after \nNbS has been implemented; evaluation and monitoring of NbS) assessments; and being technical/physical, \neconomic or environmental/social impact oriented (see Section 2.2.1.3). \n \nSeveral NBS assessment frameworks have been suggested (see, e.g., Calliari et al. (2019) and EC (2021a). \nCollaborative, co-productive approaches including knowledge, expertise and lived experiences of many \nstakeholders have been highlighted as being particularly relevant for robust NBS impact assessments (EC, \n2021a). These commonly include three key elements: (i) multi-functionality (simultaneous delivery of \neconomic, environmental and social benefits), (ii) cost-effectiveness, and (iii) co-production of \nscientifically sound knowledge through multi-stakeholder engagement (Raymond, et al., 2017; Calliari, \nStaccione, & Mysiak, 2019; EC, 2021a). \n \n\n1.5 Links to global and EU policies \n \nA wide set of global and European policies was analysed in the previous EEA report (EEA, 2021) to examine \nwhether and to what degree NBS are explicitly or implicitly supported as tools for CCA and DRR. Table 1 \nsummarizes key policy frameworks which are considered as having strong explicit support for NBS (i.e., \nexplicit mention of NBS in connection with CCA and/or DRR; and strong embedding throughout the policy, \nincluding in objectives, actions and instruments). \n \nGlobal policy agreements recognize the role nature plays in promoting sustainable development and \nbuilding resilience against disaster and climate change (EEA, 2021). For example, the Sendai Framework \nfor Disaster Risk Reduction - SFDRR (UNDRR, 2015) recognizes the role of ecosystems and environment as \ncross-cutting issues in DRR, emphasising that ecosystems need to be considered in undertaking risk \nassessments, in risk governance and in investing in resilience. Furthermore, the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, \n2015) recognized the need to protect the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity for climate change \nadaptation and mitigation. Many of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2019 included NBS in their \nadaptation and mitigation plans (Seddon, et al., 2020b). Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) policy \ndocuments offer strong explicit support for NBS, e.g., the zero draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity \nframework includes among the 2030 targets a specific one related to NBS and EbAp for addressing climate \nimpacts (CBD, 2020). \n \nWithin the European policy arena, NBS are especially highlighted in the recently released European Green \nDeal (placing NBS as the centre of the work on climate adaptation and mitigation) and its associated policy \ninitiatives, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 (EC, 2020a) and the EU Strategy on Adaptation to \nClimate change (EC, 2021c). The former refers to NBS as an essential tool for emission reduction and \nclimate adaptation and ecosystem restoration, while the latter aims to make the EU climate-resilient by \n2050 and explicitly recognizes the role of NBS for increasing climate resilience and contributing to multiple \nEuropean Green Deal objectives. Here, it is highlighted that Europe needs to leverage more investments \nin nature-based solutions to generate gains for adaptation, mitigation, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, \nand health. \n\n \n2 DRM is the organisation, planning and application of measures preparing for, responding to and recovering from disaster \n(UNDRR, 2017). DRM and DRR are interlinked: DRR is the policy objective of DRM, and the goals and objectives of the latter are \ndefined in the DRR strategies and plans (EEA, 2021). \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 14 \n\nTable 1: Key international and EU policies with a strong explicit reference to NBS (and related terms) for addressing \nCCA and DRR (adapted from EEA, (2021). \n\nPolicy area Policy International / \nEU  \n\nNBS-related term Reference to \nDRR \n\nReference to \nCCA  \n\nDisaster Risk \nReduction   \n\nSendai Framework for Disaster \nRisk Reduction (SFDRR) 20142030 (2015) \n\nInternational \n(UN) \n\nEA/EbAp; EbA; Eco-DRR \u2714 \u2714 \n\nClimate Paris Agreement on climate \nchange (UNFCCC) (2015) \n\nInternational \n(UN) \n\nNBS; EbA; SM/EBM/SFM; \nEco-DRR \n\n\u2714 \u2714 \n\nBiodiversity Convention on Biological \nDiversity (CBD) (1993) \n\nInternational \n(UN) \n\nNBS; EA/EbAp; GI/BGI; EbA; \nSM/EBM/SFM; NWRM; EcoDRR \n\n\u2714 \u2714 \n\nUrban  New Urban Agenda \u2013 Habitat III \n(2016) \n\nInternational  \n(UN) \n\nNBS; EA/EbAp; EbA; GI/BGI; \nEbA; SM/EBM/SFM; \n\n\u2714 \u2714 \n\nCross-cutting European Green Deal  EU NBS \u2714 \u2714 \nBiodiversity  Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 \n\n(2020) \nEU NBS; GI/BGI; SM/EbM/SFM \u2714 \u2714 \n\nBiodiversity Green Infrastructure Strategy \n(2013) \n\nEU NBS; EA/EbAp; GI/BGI; EbA; \nEco-DRR \n\n\u2714 \u2714 \n\nDisaster Risk \nReduction \n\nAction Plan on the Sendai \nFramework for Disaster Risk \nReduction (2016) \n\nEU NBS; EA/EbAp; GI/BGI; EbA; \nSM/EBM/SFM; NWRM; EcoDRR \n\n\u2714 \u2714 \n\nClimate  Strategy on Adaptation to Climate \nChange (2013, 2021) \n\nEU NBS; GI/BGI; SM/EbM/SFM \u2714 \u2714 \n\nWater \nmanagement \n\nFloods Directive (2007) EU SM/EbM/SFM; NWRM \u2714 \u2714 \n\n \nThe analysis illustrates that NBS are increasingly embedded in global and EU policy frameworks as a means \nto address CCA and DRR challenges. This also indicates the need for NBS assessments for supporting the \nsuccessful implementation of these policies and recommendations as well as for evaluating the impact of \npolicies and their potential shortcomings. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 15 \n\n2 A framework for strategic planning of NBS assessments \n \n\n2.1 Success factors of NBS assessments \n \nNature-based solutions play an important and increasing role in both adaptation and disaster risk \nmanagement. They can serve to increase the resilience of societies to both abrupt and slow-onset climatic \nand non-climatic hazards, reduce impacts on human health and mortality, and improve overall liveability, \nwell-being and sustainability of both urban and rural areas while also promoting biodiversity and \nenvironmental quality (EEA, 2021). As described in Section 1.5, NBS are promoted as preferred or \nimportant solutions in a range of global and EU policies. NBS are often seen as no-regret measures for \naddressing climate and non-climate disaster risks due to the wide range of societal co-benefits they \nprovide (e.g., for physical and mental health, environmental quality and health, biodiversity, aesthetics, \nrecreation, and social cohesion as well as economic benefit) in addition to the primary intended purpose \nin risk alleviation (CBD, 2019; IPCC, 2012). Their use is therefore often justified even in situations of \nuncertainty about the projected severity of the climate or other disaster risks and impacts (as so called \n\u201cno-regret solutions\u201d). Holistic, high-quality assessments of NBS are necessary to reveal, where \nappropriate quantify, and enhance their provisioning of diverse benefits and promote better \nunderstanding and accelerated uptake of NBS. \n \nSeveral elements, which relate to NBS assessments, have been highlighted as key success factors and \nlimitations in existing literature and are summarised in Table 2. Further success and limiting factors are \ndiscussed in the specific cases in Chapter 3. Designing an NBS assessment with the integration of success \nfactors in mind is the basis for the conceptual and practical applications explored in this report. \n \nTable 2: The success and limiting factors of nature-based solutions in adaptation and disaster risk management \n(Sources: based on Ecofys (2017), (EC, 2020c), McVittie, Cole, Wreford, Sgobbi, & Yordi (2018), Nalau, Becken, & \nMackey (2018), Sarabi, Han, Romme, de Vries, & Wendling (2019), Altamirano, de Rijke, Basco Carrera, & Arellano \n(2021)). \n\nLimiting factors of NBS Success factors for NBS \nLack of political support.

Multiple sources of finance linked to multiple benefits \nand multiple ecosystem services.  Early budgeting and assignment of \nfunds and responsibilities to meet maintenance needs. \n\nDifficulties in NBS tendering process (e.g. lack of knowledge on \nhow to present a convincing business case for NBS, lack of track \nrecord, lack of (experienced) suppliers, path dependency \nfavouring engineered solutions). \n\nEngagement with NBS technical and NBS economics experts to gather \nsupporting evidence for robust business case development. Early crossdepartmental collaboration including engaging with procurement and \nfinance units. Consideration of alternative procurement and delivery \nmechanisms outside own procurement. \n\n \nIt is evident that assessments that can demonstrate to decision-makers NBS effectiveness at the relevant \nscale can also facilitate cross-departmental collaboration, organize existing knowledge and create new \nevidence of social, environmental and economic costs and benefits, and recognise a multitude of cobenefits as well as open access to funding and financing. \n \n\n2.2 A Step-wise framework for designing NBS assessments \n \nIn order to structure and guide the processes, which need to take place when designing a well-planned \nNBS assessment, we present a Step-by-Step framework (Figure 3). The steps in the framework examine \nthe specific purposes for which NBS assessments can be undertaken in the CCA and DRR contexts, the \nadditional synergistic purposes these assessments may serve as well as the key methodological \ncharacteristics that guide the assessment design and the final choice of the best suited approach. \n \nThe framework follows four steps: \n \nStep 1: Identifying NBS assessment purposes and goals, including outcome needs - examined in further \ndetail in Section 2.2.1; \n \nStep 2: Defining assessment characteristics as guided by the purposes - outlined in Section 2.2.2; \n \nStep 3: Selection of elements to be included in the assessment, which may be technical, environmental, \nsocial or economic - see latter part of Section 2.2.3; and 2.2.4; \n \nStep 4: Choice of the assessment approach (or several approaches) based on all of the above deliberations \n(see Section 2.2.5); \n \nData and resource considerations need to be part of every step of the decision-making and will in turn be \ninformed by the decisions made, especially on the purposes, goals and output needs. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 17 \n\n      \nFigure 3: Framework for NBS assessment design process (Source: own elaboration partially inspired by EC (2021a) \nEvaluating the Impact of Nature-based Solutions: A Handbook for Practitioners, Chapter 6). \n \nIt needs to be noted that in many cases the various elements considered in this process will not be cleanly \ndelineated and neatly fitting in defined separate categories. Instead, they may be overlapping, combined \nor embedded within each other and therefore each NBS assessment design will have its own unique \npattern. \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 18 \n\n2.2.1 STEP 1: Purpose and goal setting  \n \n\nEarly and clear definition of the purpose for evaluating NBS in the \ncontext of a broader policy-making and implementation cycle is \nimportant to determine the type and level of complexity of the \nassessment needed. A multitude of questions can be answered, \nsuch as: Which CCA or DRM planning and implementation cycle \nStep (see Figure 5 and Figure 6) and which decisions will the \nassessment support? What is the information gap that the \nassessment should address? Who are the intended users of the \ninformation and what are their information needs? How will the \n\noutcomes of the assessment be fed into the decision- and policy-making process? What additional \npurposes might the assessment help to benefit? \nThe definition of the purpose starts with identifying the entry point(s) in the CCA or DRM cycle, which the \nassessment will serve. \n \n\n2.2.1.1 Entry points in adaptation to climate change cycle \n \nThe need for assessments of the potential and planned or implemented adaptation measures, including \nthose based on NBS, arises in several Steps in the adaptation cycle. Based on the adaptation cycle defined \nby the EU Guidance for developing adaptation strategies (EC, 2013) as well as the Adaptation Support Tool \n(EC/EEA, n.d.a) and Urban Adaptation Support Tool (EC/EEA and Convenant of Mayors, n.d.) on ClimateADAPT portal (EC/EEA, n.d.b), the key entry points have been illustrated in Figure 5 and are the following: \n\u2022 CCA cycle Step 3: Identifying adaptation options; \n\u2022 CCA cycle Step 4: Assessing adaptation options; \n\u2022 CCA cycle Step 5: Implementing adaptation; \n\u2022 CCA cycle Step 6: Monitoring and evaluation (may involve continuous or regular monitoring and \n\nassessment, which is carried out during Step 5 as well). \n \n\n \nFigure 5: Entry points for NBS assessments in the adaptation planning and implementation cycle. \n\nFigure 4 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 19 \n\n2.2.1.2 Entry points in disaster risk management cycle \n \nThe EU\u2019s Sendai Framework Action Plan (EC, 2016) identifies the fostering and implementation of \necosystem-based approaches to DRR as one of its priorities and foresees the development of an \nassessment framework and guidance for developing Green Infrastructure in cities specifically. This action \nis planned to support the Sendai Priority 3 \"Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience\". In a clear \noverlap with the adaptation to climate change community, NBS are seen as key components of building \nresilience in DRM, with the difference being in the scope of risks being addressed. \n \nThe DRM cycle differs from the adaptation cycle in that it is centred around the occurrence of disasters \nand therefore is split into pre-disaster, disaster response and post-disaster stages (see Figure 6). NBS are \nmainly considered, assessed and implemented in the pre-disaster stage as prevention measures; however, \ntheir effectiveness should ideally also be assessed post-disaster. On this basis, the entry points for NBS \nassessments in the DRM cycle are: \n\u2022 Planning and implementation of NBS as part of prevention approach; \n\u2022 Assessments as part of ongoing maintenance and operation of NBS solutions; \n\u2022 Post-disaster evaluation of NBS effectiveness and performance and \n\u2022 Post-disaster assessment of the need for NBS improvements or additional NBS. \n \n\n \nFigure 6: Disaster risk management planning and implementation cycle and entry points for NBS assessment. \n \n\n2.2.1.3 Purposes of NBS assessments in CCA and DRR contexts \n \nWith (a) clear entry point(s) in mind, the specific purpose of the assessment can be further defined and \nrefined based on the participating or targeted stakeholder needs. The typical purposes for NBS \nassessments in both adaptation and DRM cycles are similar and can be categorised as ex-ante, operational \nphase and ex-post assessments based on their timing in relation to an NBS project and its implementation. \nIn relation to the NBS project implementation cycle outlined by EC (2021a) (on page 36, Fig. 1 and Fig 3), \nex-ante assessments take place during stakeholder engagement, assessment, project and action planning, \nwhile operational phase assessments are mostly undertaken during NBS implementation and ex-post \nassessments as part of the monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 20 \n\nPurposes for ex-ante assessments (CCA cycle Steps 3 and 4 and prevention phase in DRM cycle) \n\u2022 Providing a robust evidence base for informing the project\u2019s holder(s) about the benefits and trade-offs \n\nof choosing between different options of measures for adaptation/disaster prevention (including \ncomparisons with conventional, grey and other measures). \n\n\u2022 Assessing the technical effectiveness of NBS for risk reduction and resilience increase in support of \nthe engineering technical design (including as design scenarios), also in comparison to other measures. \n\n\u2022 Understanding the full range of environmental, economic and societal impacts and benefits of NBS \ngoing beyond the adaptation/DRM benefit, and to identify pathways for enhancing synergies and \nreducing trade-offs. \n\n\u2022 Assessing the expected costs of implementation and maintenance in support of budget planning \n\u2022 Assessing project economic parameters such as the net present value, cost-effectiveness and cost\nbenefit ratios alone or in comparison with other measures to build the business case for NBS \nimplementation. \n\n\u2022 Provide data and messaging for communication on the benefits of NBS as adaptation/DRM measures \n\u2013 including to aid stakeholder awareness, participation and buy-in (credibility, legitimacy, salience). \n\n\u2022 Assessments of NBS potential for carbon or biodiversity credit/offset or compensation schemes. \n\u2022 Assessments of NBS projects to build a financial case for attracting sustainable private sector finance \n\nfor adaptation/DRM, based on applicable sustainable finance frameworks3 and their criteria. \n \nPurposes for operational phase assessments (CCA cycle Step 5 and 6, ongoing operation and maintenance \nphases in DRM cycle) \n\u2022 Continuous or regular monitoring and assessments of the technical and economic performance of the \n\nimplemented NBS (may be expanded to include broader environmental and social effect observations): \n- for calibration purposes; \n- to build understanding and evidence base on the functioning of NBS; \n- for verification of the design or identification of design improvements and possible scale-up; \n- for assessing and reporting the expenditure and benefits ratios, including for supporting \n\nmaintenance cost budgeting. \n\u2022 Assessment of the asset value of the NBS for inclusion in balance sheets. \n \nPurposes for ex-post assessments (CCA cycle Step 6, post-disaster evaluation phase in DRM cycle) \n\u2022 Assessing the effect achieved of NBS on the climate impact/risk reduction (the resilience effect) \u2013 the \n\nchange in the system as compared to the baseline before \u2013 including to aid the overall evaluation of \nadaptation/DRM strategy or plan implementation. \n\n\u2022 Assessing the return on investment made. \n\u2022 Evaluating the full societal benefit achieved across the full range of benefits, costs and dis-benefits of \n\nNBS. \n\u2022 Knowledge base for informing future designs, funding and implementation approaches for NBS as \n\nadaptation/DRM measures. \n \nIt is evident that NBS assessments can serve a multitude of purposes across CCA and DRM cycles starting \nfrom the early phases of planning through to the post-implementation monitoring and evaluation, outputs \nof the latter may further feed in the planning of new or improved NBS thus starting a new cycle. In line \nwith the defined purposes, the assessments may be more technical or social and environmental benefit \noriented, focused on the economics or any combinations of these (see Section 2.2.2). Having a full upfront clarity on where and how the NBS assessment or a series of assessments will fit in the full CCA/DRM \ncycle provides the advantage of strategic early planning to ensure synergies between the assessment \nefforts and provide continuous flow of information as needed in support of CCA and DRM objectives. \n \n\n \n3 Such as the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including the EU Taxonomy of sustainable economic activities: \nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance_en \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 21 \n\nAnother way to increase the resource-effectiveness of an NBS assessment is the consideration of other \nsynergistic purposes the assessment may serve outside of the CCA/DRM realm, which is addressed in the \nfollowing. \n\n2.2.1.4 Synergistic purposes and benefits of NBS assessments \n \nIn the specific context of CCA and DRR planning and implementation, the assessments of NBS may \nprimarily focus on their suitability, performance and cost-effectiveness to address specific climatic and \nnon-climatic hazard risks. Nevertheless, an early and deliberate identification of other synergistic purposes \nthese assessments can and will serve is beneficial to achieve a broader use of the assessment outcomes in \nvarious policy and decision-making areas and a more efficient use of resources devoted to the assessment. \nSuch integrated, multi-purpose assessments require inclusion of a wider scope of assessment elements \n(see Section 2.2) and can reveal a broader range of benefits (and trade-offs) than single-purpose \nassessments. This may provide a richer context and evidence base for decision-making about NBS. \nIntegrated assessments are also likely to require more extensive and/or intensive stakeholder \nparticipation, e.g., the representatives and data holders from the synergistic fields of practice). The \nsynergistic benefits of multi-purpose NBS assessments may include the following: \n\u2022 To generate knowledge supporting biodiversity and other environmental management policies and \n\nimplementation (including conservation, water and waste management, soil conservation, air water \nand noise pollution control and reduction). \n\n\u2022 To integrate climate change mitigation benefits in the solution (e.g., reduced emissions, carbon \nstorage and sequestration). \n\n\u2022 To provide data and metrics required for carbon farming, carbon removals and storage certification.4 \n\nor biodiversity credit, offset or compensation schemes present in various European countries.5 \n\u2022 To improve the understanding of the benefits related to physical and mental health and how to best \n\ndesign NBS to maximise these in addition to the main adaptation purpose. \n\u2022 To account for and incentivise the consideration of social benefits (e.g., due to recreation \n\nopportunities and creation of social interaction spaces, increased equality in access to green space). \n\u2022 To explore the integration with food production/agriculture benefits. \n\u2022 To assess the potential impact of NBS implementation on land and real-estate value changes, or land\nuse related opportunity costs. \n\u2022 To inform spatial and urban planning policies, such as those addressing place-making, regeneration, \n\nbrownfield remediation and similar activities. \n\u2022 To understand and plan for other cascading effects, such as energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, \n\nand local economic activity. \n\u2022 To build a broader, more multi-faceted business case for investment, possibly involving several \n\nblended funding sources, also including private sector. \n\u2022 To illustrate new economic opportunities and green job creation. \n\u2022 To understand the cost-bearing and benefit distribution between different stakeholders and identify \n\nmisalignments that need to be addressed. \n\u2022 To integrate into environmental-economic accounts aligned with the UN SEEA-EA standard (SEEA, \n\n2021). \n\u2022 To illustrate NBS contributions to local Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 implementation and overall \n\nsustainability strategies. \n\u2022 To contribute to the state-of-the-art and increase the evidence/knowledge base on NBS. To generate \n\nlocal knowledge on NBS that can be used to access European Union, national or local sector funding. \n \n\n \n4 For more on EU Carbon farming policy see: https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/forests-and-agriculture/carbon-farming_en \n5 For country policies in this regard see: https://biodiversity.europa.eu/countries \n\nhttps://biodiversity.europa.eu/countries\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 22 \n\nThese synergistic benefits have been summarized from expert group inputs, literature overview in the EEA \nreport on NBS in Europe (EEA, 2021) and a global survey of green infrastructure practitioners6 as well as \nauthors' expert experience, however there may be examples of other synergistic benefits, especially those \narising in specific local contexts. \n \n\n2.2.2 STEP 2: definition of assessment characteristics \n \n\nIn light of the wide variety of purposes NBS assessments can serve, \nthe choice of an assessment approach needs to be matched to its \nintended purpose. To do that, it is first necessary to identify the \nkey assessment characteristics and output types required for \nfulfilling the purpose (Step 2, Figure 3), before decisions on the \nelements to be addressed by the assessment (Step 3, Figure 3) and \non the choice of the specific approaches (Step 4, Figure 3) can be \nmade. Here we outline the questions that need to be considered \nand answered for a range of key assessment characteristics. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nKey aspects to consider for defining the assessment characteristics include: \n \nIntended use of assessment outputs and their users \n\u2022 Will the assessment serve one or multiple purposes (see Section 2.2.1.3)? \n\u2022 Where in the adaptation/DRM planning and implementation cycle the assessment is required (see \n\nSection 2.2.1)? \n\u2022 Based on the purpose, which economic, environmental, social or multidisciplinary aspects need to be \n\nincluded in the assessment?  \n \nFor determining the intended use of assessment outputs, it is important to have a good understanding of \nwho are the users of the assessment output and what decisions the NBS assessment should inform. \n \nScale and geographical context \n\u2022 What is the scale of the assessment \u2013 plot scale, neighbourhood, city, regional, national or international \n\nscale? \n\u2022 What are the local specificities and do they require high level of adaptation of the approach to the \n\nparticular local decision-making context? \n \nTo address these considerations, a scoping analysis including site visits and stakeholder consultations can \nhelp clarify the need for adaptation and DRR within the specific local context. This includes information on \nsite location including its economic, environment, social and institutional characteristics, climate change \nimpacts, as well as possible NBS options that are considered (see Table 3 in Green-Gray Community of \nPractice (2020)). \n \nLevel of stakeholder engagement and participatory process of co-creation \n\u2022 Should the assessment be expert or stakeholder driven or both? How are different knowledge types \n\nincluded and integrated in the assessment (e.g., indigenous and local knowledge, citizen science, expert \nknowledge etc.)? \n\n\u2022 Which stakeholder concerns need to be included? \n\n \n6 Unpublished.

Is a smaller scale consultation \nsufficient, or should a collaborative co-creation and co-management approach be pursued? \n\n \nAn inclusive and transparent assessment process can be critical for building credibility of the both the \nassessment process and output, which is vital for ensuring the use of the generated information in decision \nmaking. \n \nComparative approach for assessing advantage and disadvantages to conventional options \n\u2022 Does a comparative design of the assessment (e.g., compare against grey alternatives, between \n\ndifferent NBS, between different locations or characteristics of the same or similar NBS) help in \nhighlight particular characteristics of NBS, which are of relevance for decision making (e.g. cost \neffectiveness when compared to other options)? \n\n \nNBS involve different degrees of anthropogenic input ranging from little or no input (ecosystem \nconservation) to high input (creating new ecosystems) (Eggermont, et al., 2015). When considering NBS \noptions serving as green infrastructure, the characterisation of NBS options can be assessed according to \nthe degree of green-grey infrastructure (see Figure 8). The conceptual representation of NBS options along \nthe green to grey gradient helps in identifying, comparing and communicating assessed options. \n \n\n \nFigure 8: Green-Gray Community of Practice  (2020).

The following \nquestions may aid the decisions for choosing the scope of \nelements to be included in the assessment and the further \ndetailing of them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nEnvironmental element addressing positive and negative environmental impacts \n\u2022 Which environmental impacts (positive and negative) have to be considered and assessed? \n\u2022 Does the NBS measure have an impact on ecosystems and what consequences does this have for \n\nbiodiversity, water cycle, soil quality, erosion, noise or other environmental variables? \n\u2022 Which ecosystem services are affected and how? \n\u2022 Who are the stakeholder groups impacted by such environmental impacts? \n \nEnvironmental impact assessments are often required by law with guidance on certain environmental \nvariables to be addressed. For assessing the environmental impacts of NBS it is in particular important to \nfocus on how the NBS measure impacts biodiversity, ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services \nas these are central characteristics of any NBS measure. In particular the assessment of impacts on the \nprovision of ecosystem services requires a focus on who are the potentially affected stakeholders? \n \nSocial, human, cultural element addressing societal impacts \n\u2022 What are social, human and cultural aspects that that are impacted by an NBS measure? \n\u2022 Who is benefiting from an NBS measure and who is negatively impacted and bearing the cost? \n\u2022 Does an NBS enhance human wellbeing? If so, what are these benefits and how can the NBS measure \n\nbe designed for serving multiple purposes besides adaptation and disaster risk reduction? \n\u2022 Does a NBS measure have adverse impacts on any particular stakeholder groups? If so, what are these \n\nnegative impacts and how can they be avoided? \n\u2022 Does the implementation of an NBS measure have a risk of increasing inequalities among stakeholder \n\ngroups? \n\u2022 How does the NBS measure impact the human relationship with nature? \n\u2022 Are any indigenous or traditional management practices impacted by the NBS measure? \n \nEconomic element addressing costs and benefits  \n\u2022 Which dis-benefits and costs related to the NBS implementation need to be considered (see Table 5 in \n\nGreen-Gray Community of Practice (2020))? For example, planning and design costs, opportunity and \ntransaction costs, capital costs involved in financing the NBS measure, costs involved in implementation \n(e.g., construction costs), costs related to monitoring, maintenance, and management of a NBS \nmeasure. \n\n\u2022 Are there any long-term uncertainties from which further costs could evolve? \n\u2022 Does the maintenance of the NBS measure and the related cost also enhance its resilience to climate \n\nchange for ensuring its sustainability? \n\u2022 Which benefits related to the NBS implementation need to be considered? Are there synergies of the \n\nNBS measure with other purposes or societal goals beyond adaptation and DRR? \n\nFigure 9 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 25 \n\nTechnical, physical and performance of NBS element and types of outputs relevant for demonstrating \nNBS effectiveness  \n\u2022 Which information on the NBS option is most relevant for decision making: technical effectiveness \n\ninformation (e.g., cooling effect of green space, rainwater retention, etc.), environmental information \n(e.g., biodiversity benefits), social information (e.g., number of inhabitants benefiting from an NBS \nmeasure) or economic information (e.g., electricity costs saved, damage costs avoided, etc.)? \n\n\u2022 What are the required output types \u2013 quantitative, qualitative, visual, etc.? \n\u2022 Which output metrics are important for the purpose? \n \nA central characteristic for the performance of an NBS is its provision and strengthening of ecosystems \nand their provision of ecosystem services for CCA and DRR. Assessments of natural capital including \necosystem services can include both monetary and biophysical indicators on, for example, provisioning \nservices (e.g., goods harvested such as agricultural products, timber and non-timber forest products), \nregulating services (e.g., water quality, temperature, carbon sequestration and storage, erosion control, \npollination), and cultural services (e.g., recreation, tourism, etc.). \n \n\n2.2.4 Data and resource considerations \nA clear definition of the purpose of the NBS assessment (Step 1), its characteristics (Step 2), and thematic \nelements (Step 3) is a prerequisite for determining what kind of data is required to inform decision making. \nThereby, it is important that decision makers regard the generated data and information to be credible, \nrelevant and legitimate for informing decision processes (Sarkki, et al., 2015). It is not always necessary to \nuse the most detailed and sophisticated methods for generating credible, relevant and legitimate \ninformation. If similar assessments have been conducted elsewhere, experiences and information can \npossibly be transferred across sites (e.g., data on the cooling effect of trees or benefit transfer of economic \ninformation related to urban green) using secondary data. However, NBS effectiveness often depends on \nthe specific local context, primary data on key indicators might be needed. Given that resources are \nlimited, it is important to achieve a balance between credibility, relevance and legitimacy of the required \ndata and information. This also has to be considered when choosing the assessment approach (Section \n2.2.5). \n\n2.2.4.1 Requirements for the input and output data \n \n\u2022 Are there specific requirements for input and output data quality for the purpose? How robust and \n\nreliable do the outputs need to be? (See Box 1) \n\u2022 What level of detail and spatial and temporal data resolution is necessary? \n\u2022 How does the assessment need to account for and deal with uncertainty and incomplete information; \n\nincluding future socio-economic and climate change scenarios and their impacts on NBS? \n\u2022 Can information and experiences from other sites be transferred and applied for informing decision \n\nmaking? Or are in-situ assessments for generating primary data required? \n\u2022 To whom and how do the results need to be communicated. Which information is the most relevant \n\nfor stakeholders? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 26 \n\nThe data and expertise needed for achieving the needed outputs and its availability will heavily impact the \nchoice of the assessment method. \n \nBox 1: Data related choices \nIdeally, there should be a balance between credibility, relevance and legitimacy of the data with regards to its use for informing decision \nmaking (Sarkki et al. 2015). These aspects need to be considered when defining data requirements. While the data-related choices below \nare presented as dichotomous, in many cases there will be a need of combining the different options, for example, by using numeric and \nnarrative-based and visual data instead of choosing just one type. \n\n1. Qualitative vs. quantitative information. \n2. Quick and rough vs. slow and detailed assessments. \n3. Coarse vs fine grained data (granularity, resolution, accuracy). \n4. Spatial vs non-spatial data. \n5. Large scale vs small scale. \n6. Data acquisition pattern: continuous vs. demand-driven vs. one-off vs. Periodic. \n7. Direct measurements (e.g., in-situ sampling, on the ground monitoring) vs. remote sensing vs. off-site experiments vs. secondary \n\ndata transfer vs. crowd-sourced data (e.g., citizen science). \n8. Numeric versus narrative versus visual information. \n9. Data processing level: raw data vs. quality-controlled data vs processed data. \n\nSource: based on Annex of the Evaluating the Impact of Nature-Based Solutions: A Handbook for Practitioners (EC, 2021a) \n\n \n\n2.2.4.2 Available resources and influence on assessment design \n \n\u2022 What resources are available for carrying out the assessment in terms of personnel and their skills, \n\navailable tools and funding? \n\u2022 How much time can be devoted to the assessment? By when is the information needed in order to be \n\nrelevant for the decision-making process? \n \nIn most cases, resource requirements will correlate with the level of detail, quality and thoroughness of \nthe assessment as determined by required inputs and outputs. Both data and resource considerations \nneed to be part of each Step of the decision-making when designing an NBS assessment to ensure the right \nbalance of resource use and comprehensiveness of the outputs. \n \nIn many cases, the overarching purpose will not determine all of the key characteristics of the assessment \n(i.e., the answers to all of the above questions). This reflects the fact that the same type of assessment \nmay be carried out for the same purpose but with different underlying characteristics: varying timeframes, \na differing level of detail and a range of different outputs. For example, for the overarching purpose of \ncomparing the different NBS solutions addressing pluvial flood risk in a city, the decisions may be made \nthat the assessment will be forward-looking on a decadal timescale, assessed on the neighbourhood level \nwith a robust uncertainty assessment, and should produce primarily technical effectiveness data as \noutputs. Or alternatively, it may require yearly resolution for the next 30 years, carried out on a plot scale \nand besides the technical focus will also include economic metrics as outputs. It is thus rather the careful \nconsideration of the main purpose in combination with more detailed case-by-case needs and \nrequirements and the corresponding choices that will present the full picture characterising the \nassessment needs.  \n \nSection 2.2.2 of this report proposes a conceptual framework that can guide a decision-maker through the \nSteps of designing an assessment which is fit for purpose. \n \nBuilding up on the previous discussion in Sections 2.2.1 to 2.2.4 and inputs from case studies discussed in \nmore detail in Chapter 3, Annex 1 compiles the list of purposes for NBS assessments along with key \ncharacteristics the assessments for these purposes typically require (but may vary, sometimes \nsignificantly). Annex 1 likewise maps the assessment approaches that may be useful to fulfil each of the \npurposes (the methodological approaches are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2) as well as links to \nreal-world case examples. \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 27 \n\n2.2.5 STEP 4: Approaches for NBS assessments \n \n\n(EC, 2021a) As discussed in the previous Section, the design of \nassessments of NBS for CCA and DRR strongly depends on the \nparticular purpose and information needs identified for a given \ndecision-making context. This includes information on the \nadaptation or DRR objective (e.g., flood risk reduction), the \nenvironmental and social-ecological context, and costs and \nbenefits resulting from the intervention. The following Sections \nprovide a brief overview of several possible methodological \napproaches for NBS assessments, which may be matched with \nthe identified purposes, needs, required assessment \ncharacteristics and scope of thematic elements. Each of the \napproaches summarised in this Section may in themselves \npresent a specific method or a combination of methods or may \nbe implemented by using different embedded methods. The \nchoice about the right combination of methods and the \noverarching approach may not always be immediately apparent \nand discussion among the project team, experts and \nstakeholders frequently referring back to the decisions made in \nthe previous Steps may be needed. \n \nThe approaches that are likely to lead to successful outcomes if, \nas recommended by the NBS Handbook, they (EC, 2021a) follow \nthese guiding principles:  \n1.  Scientifically sound. \n2.  Practical and straight-forward. \n3.  Use reference conditions and baseline assessment, including \nmonitoring (for performance assessments). \n4.  Align with policy principles and reporting obligations. \n5.  Based on a transdisciplinary approach (especially important \nwhen targeting multiple purposes as suggested in Section 2.2.1) \n \nThese principles, however, also indicate that the process of \ndesigning assessments involves addressing trade-offs between \nthe level of detail the assessment needs to generate as output \nversus the effort and resources available. This includes, for \nexample, ensuring the scientific robustness of assessment \noutcomes while at the same time aiming for a \u201cpractical and \n\nstraight-forward\u201d assessment approach in the sense of being doable with the available resources, skills \nand expertise. Assessments should also align with the policy context and may require transdisciplinarity, \ninvolving experts from various disciplines and sectors, but within the same resource limitations. In this \nprocess of determining the assessment design, it is critical to consider the purpose of the assessment as \noutlined in Section 2.2.1. This will help in achieving an adequate balance between assessment complexity \nand the generation of assessment outcomes that are useful for the intended purpose and possible within \nthe available resources.  \n \nThe main groups of available approaches for assessing key adaptation and DRR objectives as well as their \nmultiple benefits in different dimensions include those presented in Table 3. Please note that they are not \nmutually exclusive and are often combined with or nested within one another. The list is likewise not \nexclusive and there may be other approaches suitable for a specific context and purpose. \n \n\nFigure 10 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 28 \n\nTable 3: Approaches for assessing NBS for climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) and \ntheir multiple benefits. \n\nApproaches for assessing NBS for CCA and DRR and their \nmultiple benefits Further resources and guidance on the application of the approach \n\nEx-ante technical feasibility and expected effectiveness \nassessments (which may be based on literature, inventories, \nsensor and monitoring data, modelling-led, or based on a \nparticipatory process of jointly defining NBS objectives and key \nperformance indicators). \n\nIdentification and assessment of key performance indicators (KPIs) related \nto the expected hazard, exposure and vulnerability to be addressed by the \nNBS (e.g., area and number of households likely to benefit by NBS \nimplementation. See Chapter 2 by Skodra et al. in (EC, 2021a) for further \nguidance on NBS indicators.  \n\nStock-taking/accounting of natural capital and ecosystem \nservices (mapping, GIS, inventories) for demonstrating \necosystem assets and the flows of benefits (ecosystem \nservices) provided by NBS. \n\nVysna et al. (2021) provide guidance for developing ecosystem accounts \nwithin the EU context, including ecosystem extent accounts, ecosystem \ncondition accounts and ecosystem service accounts. \n\nEconomic valuation of specific benefits, in particular through \nthe use of environmental economics methods: contingent \nvaluation/stated preference (e.g., willingness to pay, trade-off \ngame, costless-choice), revealed preference (e.g., travel-cost \nmethod, hedonic pricing, preventive expenditure, preventive \nmarkets, etc.), benefit transfer and others. \n\n Based on the assessment of case studies Emerton (2017) provides an \noverview of approaches to valuing the benefits, costs and impacts of \necosystem-based adaptation measures. \nThe practical guide on assessing and implementing green-gray \ninfrastructure for adaptation and disaster risk reduction includes an \noverview of approached for economic valuation of benefits, cost-benefit \nanalysis and assessing return on investment with the aim of guiding \ndecision making on infrastructure investments (Green-Gray Community of \nPractice, 2020). \n\nCost-benefit assessments and cost-effectiveness \nassessments. \nReturn on investment assessments (net present value, \ninternal rate of return, payback time and others) and how \nbenefits are delivered over time. \nHolistic life-cycle-based impact assessments (life-cycle \nassessments (LCA), life-cycle costing, social-LCA, life cycle \nsustainability assessments) for a systemic understanding when \nand where impacts occur and who is impacted along the \nprocess of establishing and maintaining NBS. \n\nThe guide by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative  provides and overview \nof identifying and using life cycle impact assessment indicators (UNEP, \n2016). \n\nMulti-criteria analysis (stakeholder or expert based) for \nweighing and comparing different NBS impacts. \n\nThe handbook for practitioners on evaluating the impact of nature-based \nsolutions by the European Commission provides a detailed overview of \nindicators and methods used in EU projects for assessing NBS (EC, \n2021a). See also the appendix for further details on methods (EC, 2021b).  \n\nIndicator-based assessments with a focus on a specific set of \nindicators, not necessarily involving a systems perspective. \n\nThe handbook for practitioners on evaluating the impact of nature-based \nsolutions provides a detailed overview of indicators and methods used in \nEU projects for assessing NBS (EC, 2021a).  \n\nEnvironmental impact assessments can be required for \ncomplying with procedural and legal standards for assessing \npotential environmental impacts from the implementation of \nNBS measures. This can also contribute to generating credible \nand legitimate information.   \n\nThe implementation of public and private \nprojects often requires an environmental impact assessment before the \nimplementation of the project (EU Directive 85/337/EEC).    \n\nStakeholder assessments (interviews, surveys, focus groups, \nstakeholder seminars, public consultations), e.g., for \nunderstanding how stakeholders benefit from or are impacted \nby NBS or for informing an inclusive and participatory \nassessment design. \n\nZingraff-Hamed et al. (2020) present an approach for identifying \nstakeholders that should be involved in the co-creation of NBS based on \nexperiences from case studies within the EU projects RECONECT and \nPHUSICOS. Wehn, Rusca, Evers, & Lanfranchi (2015) present an \napproach for identifying opportunities for supporting greater engagement \nand participation of citizens in decision-making on DRR and during different \nphases of the disaster cycle (prevention, preparedness, response, and \nrecovery). \n\nTheory of change can provide a framework for strategically \nintegrating NBS assessments into decision making on \nadaptation and DRM. \n\nStafford Smith  (2020) provide guidance on how to use Theory of Change \nfor improving project outcomes that can enable transformational change. \n\nDelphi method is an iterative and participatory method for \nevaluating expert-based knowledge, which has been applied for \ndecision-support and assessing knowledge needs for NBS \nimplementation.  \n\nMukherjee et al.  (2015) guidance on using the Delphi method in ecology \nand conservation, which can also inform NBS. \nGrace et al.  (2021) describe the use of a Delphi process for assessing \nknowledge needs for implementing NBS in Mediterranean islands.  \n\nNarrative-based approaches (e.g., storylines) can help to \nintegrate different stakeholder perspectives and support the codesign of NBS assessments. \n\nWelden, Chausson, & Melanidis  (2021) highlight the importance of framing \nNBS and making explicit the co-dependence of people and nature, which \ncan support transformative change.  Davis, Gerdes, Naumann, & Hudson  \n(2015) provide examples for evidence-based narratives for NBS. \n\n \n \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/7870049/12943935/KS-FT-20-002-EN-N.pdf/de44610d-79e5-010a-5675-14fc4d8527d9?t=1624528835061\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 29 \n\nFigure 11 maps these various methods/approaches based on whether they are primarily data-led or \nstakeholder-led and which assessment elements they most commonly focus on: technical, economic, or \nenvironmental and social impact. \n \n\n \nFigure 11: Mapping of NBS assessment approaches based on the elements they focus on and data- or stakeholder-led \nmethodological orientation. \n \nAnnex 1 connects these approaches with the purposes identified in Section 2.2.1 and lists the case studies \nwhere the approach has been applied. \n \nWhile in broad terms NBS assessment approaches may be mapped based on their stakeholder-led or databased orientation and common use focus on either the technical aspects of NBS, or the \nenvironmental/social impact or economic parameters, in reality many of them may derive their inputs \nfrom \u2018either/or\u2019 or \u2018both\u2019 various data sets and stakeholder inputs and lead to a range of different outputs. \nTherefore, the definition of purposes, characteristics and elements of the assessment is likely to arrive at \nnot one, but several approach options, with the final choice depending on such considerations as data and \nknow-how availability and preferences of internal or external end-users. \n \nThe following Chapter explores how NBS assessments have been designed and carried out in real life \nsituations and various contexts across Europe and illustrates how the various elements discussed in \nChapter 2 have been considered and addressed. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 30 \n\n3 NBS assessment in practice \n \n\n3.1 Case study aims and methodology \n \nThere is a growing evidence base at the European level in terms of practice and guidance on assessment \nand monitoring of NBS projects, i.e., the report \u2018Evaluating the Impact of Nature-Based Solutions: A \nHandbook for Practitioners\u2019 (EC, 2021a) and the research and demonstration investments into NBS \ninterventions within Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe-funded research projects (EC, 2020b). This Section \nadds to the growing evidence by analysing the types of assessments and fact-checking of how past and \non-going NBS case studies have applied such an approach and what role assessments have played in the \ndecision-making. \n \nThe selection of NBS case studies for this specific analysis is based on a previous screening of European \nNBS examples where a total of 97 NBS cases in 107 locations across Europe was considered (EEA, 2021). \nThese 97 cases were identified and extracted from the following NBS platforms: Climate-ADAPT (European \nClimate Adaptation Platform); Natural Hazards \u2014 Nature-based Solutions; Naturvation (Nature-based \nUrban Innovation); NWRM (Natural Water Retention Measures); OPPLA (platform for nature-based \nsolutions); Panorama (a global project on mainstreaming ecosystem-based adaptation); and weADAPT (a \ncollaborative platform on climate change adaptation issues). Different sector and thematic areas were \nreviewed, including water management, forests and forestry, agriculture (including agroforestry), urban \nareas, coastal areas and mountains. All NBS cases retained in the screening address various societal \nchallenges using NBS for CCA and DRR. The breakdown of cases by country and sector/thematic area is \npresented in Annex 3 of EEA (2021). \n \nThe analysis of cases in EEA (2021) focused on providing an overview of the type of methods applied, NBS \nmeasures implemented, innovative features of the projects and wider applications of the results and \nlessons learned. This report looks at the use of assessment frameworks and the context in which the \nassessments are chosen, designed and implemented. Notably, the analysis seeks to understand the \nfollowing components for each case study: \n\u2022 the main adaptation/DRR purpose/thematic area of a NBS case as well as the main non-adaptation \n\nrelated benefits provided by the NBS (used as main criterion on categorizing, see Section 3.2); \n\u2022 if projects have conducted a qualitative and/or a quantitative assessment of the NBS, either before, \n\nduring or after its implementation; \n\u2022 what kind of indicators have been assessed in the different types of assessments and projects; \n\u2022 for those projects that did not conduct an assessment, what were the circumstances of not carrying \n\nout an assessment. \n \nThis report also looks more in depth at 9 case studies to understand: \n\u2022 the source of funding for NBS and provisions for long-term monitoring; \n\u2022 the type of assessment methods applied and key characteristics; \n\u2022 the purpose of assessments and key determining factors; \n\u2022 the usefulness of assessment results and barriers and usefulness; \n\u2022 the inclusion of social vulnerability in assessments and involvement of stakeholders. \n \nA two-Step approach was applied. First, a short email survey was sent to the screened cases from EEA \n(2021) where a contact person could be identified. Out of the original 97 cases, it was possible to identify \ncontacts in 85 of the cases. The purpose of the email survey was to determine what type of qualitative \nand/or quantitative assessment has been applied (pls. see Annex 2 for the email survey). Second, an indepth interview was conducted with nine selected case studies during August and September 2021 (see \nAnnex 3 for survey instrument).  \n \nThe criteria for selecting cases for in-depth interviews were: \n\nhttps://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 31 \n\n\u2022 Applied assessment methods in place; \n\u2022 Data information available; \n\u2022 High quality NBS (i.e., applying not contested methods); \n\u2022 Strong focus on adaptation/DRR as main purpose. \n \nGeographic spread was deemed less important. \nThe interview guide (see Annex 3) was developed with a view to link the results of the case analysis with \npurposes and approaches of assessing NBS in general (Chapter 2). \n \n\n3.2 Overview of analysed cases \n \nThe thematic coverage of the 38 cases, which replied to the email survey (out of 85 contacted), is shown \nin Table 4. There appears to be a disproportionate number of cases related to urban and water \nmanagement NBS; however, as this is consistent with the number of responses and the number of \nlocations in the original 97 cases, this uneven distribution across sectors and thematic areas is not \nconsidered problematic in relation to the interpretation of the results or interpreted as an indicator of \nbias. \n \nTable 4: Responses across sectors and thematic areas. \n\nSectors and thematic areas Responses Sample \n\nWater management 10 20 \n\nForests & forestry 4 8 \n\nAgroforestry 2 4 \n\nAgriculture 3 7 \n\nUrban 10 32 \n\nCoastal  6 7 \n\nMountains 3 7 \n\nTotal responses 38 85 \n\n \nThe main climate change risks addressed by the NBS projects are shown in Table 5. The 6 specific risk \ncategories are identified based on the received responses. While some responses did not contain \ninformation on the impacts being addressed, others specified more than one. Accordingly, the numbers in \nTable 5 do not sum to 38. Flood risk management is the dominant risk mitigation theme, representing the \nmain focus in more than 50% of the cases, while drought risk management, heat resilience and erosion \nare mentioned as a main climate change risks targeted in around 15% of the cases. Wildfire risk \nmanagement and landslide/avalanche prevention are only mentioned as key in 1 and 2 studies, \nrespectively; this presumably reflects that these two risk types are quite specific for the thematic areas of \nforestry and mountains, which both are represented by few cases. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 32 \n\nTable 5: Climate change risks addressed in cases across thematic areas and sectors. \n Climate change risks   \n\nSectors and \nthematic \nareas \n\nFlood risk \nmanagement \n\nDrought risk \nmanagement \n\nWildfire risk \nmanagement \n\nHeat \nresilience  \n\nLandslide \n/ \n\navalanche \nErosion  \n\nOther \n(non-risk) \n\nfocus* \nNo reply \n\nUrban 7 1  5   2  \n\nWater \nmanagement 7 3    1  1 \n\nForest and \nForestry 1 1 1     2 \n\nAgroforestry  1  1    1 \n\nAgriculture 2 1      1 \n\nCoastal  4     4  1 \n\nMountain     2   1 \n\nTotal 21 7 1 6 2 5 2 7 \nNote: Some responses did not contain information on main climate change risks targeted, while others specified more \nthan one.

In another case, the focus of \nthe NBS project has been on the establishment of more - and thicker - green roofs as well as reducing energy \nconsumption and protect biodiversity \n \nThe main additional benefits provided by NBS projects are shown in Table 6. Biodiversity and ecosystem \nservices are mentioned as a main additional benefit in more than 50% of the cases, thus by far representing \nthe most frequently cited additional benefit. The replies could indicate a gap in current thinking of \nconsidering biodiversity as an additional co-benefit rather than a criterion for implementing and denoting \nprojects NBS in the first place. \nOther more frequently mentioned additional benefits include recreation (21%) and water quality (16%). \nThe \u201cOther\u201d category among others includes learning (e.g., outdoor classrooms), awareness raising/citizen \ninvolvement and energy savings. \n \nTable 6: Main additional benefits of NBS projects across sectors and thematic areas.

For qualitative NBS \nassessments, 30 cases reported they had carried out an assessment while 6 cases stated they had not and \n2 cases did not reply to this question. Table 7 outlines how these responses are distributed across sectors \nand thematic areas. Across all 38 cases, 30 cases conducted both qualitative and quantitative assessments. \nThus, both qualitative and quantitative assessments seem to be common for most of the NBS cases that \nreplied to the email survey. This is different from the screening found in the EEA (2021) report that \nscreened 97 cases. The screening, which was only based on information found from the NBS platforms \nindicated that only about 15% of the 97 cases employ monitoring and/or evaluation. The discrepancy is \nmainly due to the bias of the email survey replies \u2013 cases that did employ assessments are more likely to \nreply than those that did not. Also, it becomes evident that not all NBS platforms contain sufficient \ninformation on the use and results of assessment methods.  \n \nTwo of the cases report that no assessments had been made due to lack of funding. Considering the low \nnumber of cases where assessments have either not been made or where information is missing, it is not \npossible to identify any trends across sectors and thematic areas. Assessment approaches appear to vary \nsignificantly across cases and respondents seem to find it difficult to make a clear distinction between \nqualitative and quantitative assessment approaches, thus suggesting that the two assessment approaches \nin reality are often closely intertwined. \n \nTable 7: Use of qualitative and quantitative assessment either before, during or after project implementation. \n\nSectors and thematic \narea \n\nQualitative assessment Quantitative assessment \n\nYes No No info Yes No No info \n\nUrban 9 1  9 1  \n\nWater management 6 3 1 8 1 1 \n\nForest and Forestry 3 1  3 1  \n\nAgroforestry 2   2   \n\nAgriculture 2 1  3   \n\nCoastal  6   6   \n\nMountain 2  1 2  1 \n\nTotal 30 6 2 33 3 2 \n\n \nBased on the received responses from the 33 cases stating having carried out NBS assessment, \nassessments are categorized based on the 4 different types of thematic elements included: social, \neconomic, environmental & technical performance and other. Table 8 provides an overview of the \nprevalence of these different elements in the cases. Please note that the assessment in Table 8 \nencompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessment approaches, and that several thematic \nelements can be used in the same case. Out of the 33 cases having reporting conducting NBS assessments, \n29 cases were possible to be categorised into social, economic, environmental and other while 4 cases did \nnot give sufficient information. 11 out of the 29 cases have included both environmental, social and \neconomic elements. The remaining 18 cases conducted 1 or 2 thematic elements.  Assessments, which \nfocus on the technical and environmental performance of NBS, appear to be the most popular (25 cases), \nfollowed by cases including social (17 cases) and economic thematic elements (14 cases). Of the latter, \nthree cases report that the cost-benefit analyses approach has been used, while an additional 2 studies \nrefer to socio-economic analyses.

The nine cases represent good examples of how different NBS projects have applied different \nassessment approaches at various stages of the adaptation planning and implementation cycle (see Figure \n5) and of the disaster risk management cycle (see Figure 6). The sectors and thematic areas covered by \nthe nine in-depth cases comprise of three urban cases, two water management cases and one case relating \nto coastal, agriculture, forestry and mountains respectively. \n \nThe three urban cases address challenges relating to pluvial flood protection in Copenhagen, (Denmark), \nheat resilience through the green roofs programme in Basel (Switzerland) and the Tree Masterplan in \nBarcelona (Spain). The two water management cases focus on riverine flood protection through the Elbe \ndyke relocation (Germany) and the Dijle river restoration near Leuven (Belgium). The coastal case focuses \non coastal erosion and flood risk management through restoration of former saltworks in the Camargue \n(France). The agricultural case addresses drought and flood management on agricultural land in \nTulltorps\u00e5n (Sweden), while the forestry case deals with managing risks of wild fires, flooding and drought \nin Valencia (Spain) as well as case studies in Germany and Portugal. The mountain case in Engadin region \n(Switzerland) implemented NBS measures to prevent rock falls, landslides and avalanches. Figure 12 shows \na map of the location of the in-depth cases. \n \n\n \nFigure 12: Location and name of in-depth cases. \n \n\nAssessment approaches applied in the cases vary from ex-ante (including technical feasibility and \neffectiveness assessments, and cost-benefits analysis) to ex-post assessments (including indicator-based \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 36 \n\nassessments of e.g., tree health, biodiversity and flood occurrence. Methods involve remote sensing, insitu measurements, assessments of cost-benefits and cost-effectiveness and modelling.

Most cases are also developed within a wider perspective to \naccount for restoring habitats, enhancing biodiversity and improving liveability and recreation \nopportunities. These wider perspectives are often brought in by science partners (e.g., in the Dijle River \nRestoration, Belgium and Resilient forest, Spain, science partners brought in the wider perspective of \naccounting for multiple ecosystem services), through policy regulations (e.g., Protective Forest \nManagement, Switzerland, policy regulation required accounting for biodiversity as well), or through the \ngeneral policy agenda (e.g., Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, Denmark, the municipality had a \nwish to improve liveability in the city by bringing in more nature). The points below describe how the \nindividual cases approach CCA/DRR within a wider framework. \n\u2022 In the agricultural case in Sweden (Tulltorps\u00e5n), the main adaptation objective is to increase \n\nagricultural resilience with regard to drought. This by utilising abandoned industrial ponds as \nmultifunctional wetlands, and customised drainage systems to retain water from the autumn and \nwinter months for use in spring and summer. Expected co-benefits are improved habitats for water \nfowls and recreation opportunities. The Tulltorps\u00e5n case is a recent initiative by local landowners that \nalso initiated the single largest project of its kind in Sweden - a 10-year implementation of NBS along \n30 km of the stream in 100 locations, where the main purpose was to improve water quality and \nbiodiversity, but also turned out to be very effective in preventing flooding on agricultural land.  \n\n\u2022 In the forestry sector, the main purpose of the Resilient Forest case in three countries is both to \nimprove disaster risk and crisis management and adapt to climate change by promoting large-scale \nforest management practices that increase resilience to wildfires, water scarcity and environmental \ndegradation while supporting biomass production and biodiversity.  \n\n\u2022 In the mountains of Switzerland, the use of protective forests has shown to reduces disaster risks from \nrock falls, landslides and avalanches and can under certain circumstances dispense technical protection \ninstallations (e.g., nets). Here, also CCA is continuously discussed to improve and refine current forest \nmanagement strategy to be adaptive to climate change, as well as there is increasing attention to also \naccount for additional forest benefits (e.g., wood production, biodiversity, recreation) in DRM.  \n\n\u2022 Dyke relocation at the Elbe River at Lenzen, Germany successfully combined the increase of water \nretention capacity of floodplains for flood protection, while at the same time enhancing habitats for \nbiodiversity. Originally, the main focus of the project was on implementing dyke relocation for habitat \nrestoration and biodiversity conservation. The occurrence of flood events increased awareness of the \nneed for addressing flood mitigation. Hence the project evolved from a biodiversity conservation \nproject to a pilot site for establishing scientific evidence for the contribution of dyke relocation to \nreducing the peak flow of the river during flood events. Based on the success of this pilot site, dyke \nrelocation has been implemented in several other sites along the river \n\n\u2022 In the case of Copenhagen, the cloudburst management plan identifying NBS as a key component and \nNBS was developed and implemented in the aftermath of an extreme cloudburst event, addressing \nboth DRR and CCA. The plan fed into a wider political agenda to increase green infrastructure and \nimprove liveability in the city.  \n\n\u2022 In the Dijle valley, the restoration of natural floodplain was originally made with a DRR aim to protect \nthe city of Leuven against flood risk, but CCA has more recently come up with demands to reconsider \ncurrent water management strategies.  \n\n\u2022 In Basel, the implementation of green roofs at systematic scale reaching about 40 % of flat roofs aims \nat countering high temperatures, improving energy efficiency and sequestering carbon while \neffectively allowing red listed species to inhabit the dense urban area.  \n\n\u2022 In Barcelona, the ambitious Tree Master Plan seeks i.a., to increase canopy cover to 30% of the surface \nof the city. Adaptation to high temperatures is but one of several key objectives. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 41 \n\n\u2022 In the case of the former Camargue saltwork site, restoration of lagoons and marshes re-established \nthe hydrobiological system to both improve biodiversity and implement an adaptive management \napproach to the rising sea level. \n\n \n\n3.3.2.2 Purpose of NBS assessments  \n \n\nAs described in Sections 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.2, the first Step for a NBS \nassessment starts with identifying the entry point(s) in the CCA or \nDRM cycle and this can be further defined and refined into specific \npurposes of NBS assessments based on the needs of the participating \nor targeted stakeholders (see Section 2.2.1.3). Table 11 provides an \noverview of the entry point(s) in the CCA and DRM cycle and the \ndifferent specific purposes along the project cycle (ex-ante, \noperational phase and ex-post) of the in-depth cases. \n \n\nEx-ante phase \n \nIn the ex-ante phase of the project cycle, entry points of NBS assessments include identifying adaptation \noptions (CCA Step 3), assessing adaptation options and planning (CCA Step 4) and implementation of NBS \nas part of the prevention approach (DRM prevention). \n \nWe find that most of the in-depth cases (6 cases) applied assessment approaches in order to identify \nadaptation options (CCA cycle Step 3). Four cases also defined prevention in the DRM cycle as the entry \npoint. For several projects, there is a natural overlap between CCA and DRR activities (Camargue Saltworks \nRestoration, Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, and Elbe Dyke Relocation), while for the \nProtective Mountain Forest Management, DRR is the main purpose, although CCA is continuously \ndiscussed in terms of how the management strategy can be improved to be adaptive to climate change. \n \nThe in-depth cases include the following specific purposes for ex-ante assessments: \n \ni) Providing a robust evidence base for informing the project\u2019s holders(s) about the benefits and tradeoffs of choosing between different options of measures for CCA/DRM - Tulltorps\u00e5n, Camargue Saltworks \nRestoration, Resilient Forests, Protective Forest Management, Copenhagen Cloudburst Management \nPlan, Dijle River Restoration, Elbe Dyke Relocation. All of these cases aimed at investigating the impacts \nand trade-offs of initiating NBS projects whether it is for increasing agricultural resilience, managing flood \nrisks in urban areas, forests and coastal areas, avoiding erosion in mountains and coastal areas or reducing \nthe risk of wildfires and droughts in forested areas. The Basel Green Roof and the Barcelona Tree Master \nPlan cases were further into the CCA/DRM cycles, focusing on the operational and ex-post assessments. \n \nii) Assessing the technical effectiveness of NBS for risk reduction and resilience increase - Tulltorps\u00e5n, \nCamargue Saltworks Restoration, Resilient Forests, Protective Forest Management, Copenhagen \nCloudburst Management Plan, Dijle River Restoration, Elbe Dyke Relocation. All of these cases conducted \ntechnical feasibility and effectiveness assessments and/or indicator-based assessments to develop an \nevidence base for NBS intervention and understanding the impacts and trade-offs. A few cases also carried \nout economic assessments. The Basel Green Roof and the Barcelona Tree Master Plan cases were further \ninto the CCA/DRM cycles, focusing on the operational and ex-post assessments. \n \niii) Understanding the full range of environmental, economic and societal benefits of NBS. None of the \ncases conducted a full ex-ante assessment of both environmental, economic and wider societal benefits \nof NBS implementation. Most cases included ex-ante environmental benefit assessments (Copenhagen \nCloudburst Management Plan, Dijle River Restoration, Elbe Dyke Replacement, Protective Mountain \nForest Management, Resilient Forests, Tulltorps\u00e5n, Camargue Saltworks Restoration), while fewer \n\nFigure 13 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 42 \n\nincluded also ex-ante assessments of economic benefits (Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, \nProtective Forest Management, Camargue Saltworks Restoration). Resilient Forests have plans to include \neconomic benefit valuation in the Decision Support Tool in a later stage of the project. None of cases \nconducted ex-ante assessments of wider societal benefits. \n \niv) Assessing the expected costs of implementation and maintenance in support of budget planning. \nSeveral, but not all cases, assessed ex ante the expected costs of implementing and maintaining the NBS \noptions - Tulltorps\u00e5n, Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, Protective Mountain Forest \nManagement, Camargue Saltworks Restoration. Assessment of maintenance costs were in most cases not \nin focus, as the NBS measures to a large extent are unproven by the project holders. \n \nv) Assessing project economic parameters to build the business case for NBS implementation. Very few \nprojects have specifically made use of assessments such as cost-effectiveness, net present value and costbenefit ratios in order to underpin the decision-making process. Copenhagen Cloudburst Management \nPlan case assessed costs and benefits of combining NBS with traditional grey solutions, estimating the \nsocio-economic net benefits compared to a purely use of grey engineered solutions. The case also \nconducted cost-effectiveness of different NBS options in 7 catchments covering some 300 projects across \nthe whole city before making the decision to invest substantial amounts of public money over a 20-year \nperiod. The Protective Mountain Forest Management case conducted ex-ante cost-benefit ratio analysis \nfor the technical measures planned. The Resilient Forests case plans to include operational costs and \nbenefits into the Decision Support Tool for forest owners. The Camargue Saltworks Restoration case \npartially assessed economic aspects, mainly focusing on the costs of reconstructing the collapsed seafront \ndike compared with costs for reinforcing the inner protection and restoring the wetland. \n \nvi) Provide data and messaging for communication on benefits of NBS as adaptation to enhance \nstakeholder awareness. Several of the cases explicitly recognise the value of providing assessment data \nand insights to a wider audience for scale-up and replication purposes. The Elbe Dyke Relocation case, for \ninstance, represented the first pilot project of its sort in Germany, and the Federal Waterways Engineering \nand Research Institute had a particular interest in detailed assessment and monitoring of the technical \neffectiveness to reduce flood risks and to replicate DRR mitigation options in similar sites, while the \nFederal Agency for Nature Conservation had a particular interest in assessing ex-ante the potential for \nbiodiversity improvements and monitoring the development in the area for further knowledge build-up \nin similar projects. Today, there are about 10 similar projects in implementation stage and more projects \nare in planning across Germany as a result of the robust and positive assessments. The Barcelona Tree \nMaster Plan conducts a finely meshed, thorough and systematic monitoring of all trees in the city which \nis used i.a., to keep track of progress toward the target of the Tree Master Plan: to reach 30% canopy \ncover by 2037; to reduce the presence of any given tree species to maximum 15% to increase climate \nresilience and to ensure that all primary school children appreciate and can identify trees in the \nneighbourhood. The Camargue Saltworks Restoration case uses the evidence base to also share \nexperiences with the wider public, academia and practitioners through videos, workshops, scientific \ncongresses, brochures and fact sheets for possible replication and scale-up. \n \nvii) Assessments of NBS potential for carbon or biodiversity credit/offset or compensation scheme and \n \nviii) Assessments to build a financial case for attracting sustainable private sector finance. None of the \nnine cases had a specific purpose to obtain credits or to attract private sector finance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 43 \n\nOperational phase \n \nIn the operational phase of the project cycle, entry points of NBS assessments include implementing \nadaptation options (CCA Step 5), monitoring and evaluation (CCA Step 6) and ongoing operation and \nmaintenance phases in DRM cycle. \nWe find that about half of the in-depth cases (five cases) applied assessment approaches during the \nimplementation of adaptation (CCA Step 5) and conducted monitoring and evaluation in the operational \nphase (CCA cycle Step 6). Four cases also carried out assessments relating to the DRM entry point ongoing \nmaintenance and operation of NBS solutions. As in the ex-ante phase, several projects have a natural \noverlap between CCA and DRR activities. \n \nThe in-depth cases include the following specific purposes for operational phase assessments: \ni) Calibration purposes - Protective Forest Management, Camargue Saltworks Restoration, Tulltorps\u00e5n \nand Barcelona Tree Master Plan use assessments for calibration purposes to continuously improve \neffectiveness and resilience of the NBS interventions. \n \nii) Building understanding and evidence base on the functioning of NBS. All cases aim to build \nunderstanding and evidence base on the functioning of NBS, using different assessment approaches \naccording to the needs of the stakeholders and themselves as project-holders (See Section on drivers of \nassessment). \n \niii) Verifying the design or identifying design improvements and possible scale-up. The Basel Green Roofs \ncase has over a long time period developed and refined a monitoring design for assessing how different \ntypes, sizes and locations of green roofs enhance biodiversity and has developed guidance for other \nstakeholders across Europe to replicate a robust monitoring approach. Barcelona Tree Master Plan case \nsystematically uses assessment outputs to continuously evaluate and update urban tree planting (choice \nof species, location and infrastructure) to ensure a resilient and safe tree environment. Copenhagen \nCloudburst Management Plan uses technical and cost-effectiveness assessments at local scale to verify \nthe choice and dimensioning of hybrid NBS solutions and updates the evaluations every 4-years with the \nlatest scenarios, the Camargue Saltworks Restoration case uses the assessment output to continuously \nupdate the management place of the site and the Elbe Dyke Restoration case uses the ex-ante modelling \ncombined with ex-post monitoring of flood risk reduction impacts to draw lessons for replication \nelsewhere. \n \niv) Assessing and reporting the expenditures and benefits ratios, including for supporting maintenance \ncase budgeting. None of the cases explicitly assess and report expenditures and benefit ratios including \nto support maintenance case budgeting.  However, aspects of this are found in the ex-ante phase of the \ncases such as the Protective Mountain Forest case, estimating benefit-cost ratios to select the right \nmeasures, the Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan case, calculating cost-effectiveness of different \nsolutions to select the optimal measures at local scale and the Barcelona Tree Master Plan case, where \nthe systematic monitoring of urban trees is used internally in the organisation and towards management \nto ensure that health and safety in the city is secured even with currently 25% canopy cover. \n \nv) Assessment of the asset value of NBS for inclusion in balance sheets. None of the cases have the \npurpose to include the asset value of NBS in balance sheets. \n \nEx-post phase \n \nIn the ex-post phase of NBS projects, entry points of NBS assessments include monitoring and evaluating \nadaptation options (CCA Step 6), and post-disaster evaluation of NBS performance and effectiveness and \npost-disaster assessment of the need for NBS improvements or additional NBS phases in DRM cycle. \nWe find that four of the in-depth cases applied assessment approaches conducted monitoring and \nevaluation in the ex-post phase (CCA cycle Step 6) (Barcelona Tree Master Plan, Elbe Dyke Relocation, \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 44 \n\nCamargue Saltworks Restoration, Basel Green Roofs, Dijle River Restoration). Two cases (Protective \nMountain Forest Management and Elbe Dyke Relocation) also carried out assessments relating to the DRM \nentry point post-disaster evaluation of NBS effectiveness and performance. As in the operation and exante phases, several projects have a natural overlap between CCA and DRR activities. \n \nThe in-depth cases include the following specific purposes for ex-post assessments: \ni) Assessing the effect achieved. Most cases aim to assess the effects achieved of the NBS. The Protective \nMountain Forest case makes use of extensive monitoring and example plots to evaluate in practice the \nimpact of erosion control interventions. The Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan case is developing \nand piloting automated monitoring of the local NBS measures in the realisation that with 300 projects \nwhen the plan is fully implemented, a manual and frequent monitoring is not feasible. The Dijle River \nRestoration case i.a., conducted ex-post social Cost Benefit Assessment and the Elbe Dyke Relocation case \nmonitored in detail the effectiveness of the dyke relocation during subsequent flood events and identified \nimpacts of the project in terms of economic impacts, human/social/cultural impacts and environmental \nimpacts. The Barcelona Tree Master Plan case continuously monitors, evaluates impacts of tree \ninterventions and adapts the management plan to ensure robust and safe NBS. Assessments are also made \nby the municipality on the impacts on air pollution and air temperature. The Basel Green Roof case \nanalyses and publishes results from the monitoring of biodiversity. \nNot all projects focus on the climate impact/risk reduction, but on synergistic purposes and benefits of \nNBS assessments. This is the case, for instance, with the Basel Green Roof case, that has carried out \nbiodiversity in-situ monitoring on 25 green roofs since 2013. \n \nii) Assessing the return on investment made. None of the cases aim to assess the return on investment \nmade, although this would be possible in several of the cases. \n \niii) Evaluating the full societal benefit achieved across the full range of benefits, costs and dis-benefits \nof NBS. Only the Dijle River Restoration case evaluated the full societal benefits ex-post through a social \ncost-benefit analysis. The Tulltorps\u00e5n generation 1.0 case conducted ex-post evaluation of benefits \ngenerated from ecosystem services improved through the NBS measures, while the Tulltorps\u00e5n \ngeneration 2.0 case has not yet reached this point. However, several of the cases aim to or would like to \ninclude evaluations of full societal benefits. This includes the Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, \nthe Barcelona Tree Master Plan and the Resilient Forest. Other projects have identified, but not assessed \nsocietal benefits including the Elbe Dyke Relocation and the Camargue Saltworks Restoration cases. \n \niv) Knowledge base for informing future designs, funding and implementation approaches for NBS as \nadaptation/DRM measures. Three cases specifically aim to build a knowledge base to inform future \nprojects. This includes the Camargue Saltworks Restoration case, where the assessment outputs can be \ncapitalised upon in other similar areas; the Elbe Dyke Relocation case, where the project holders were \ninterested in gaining experience for replication and scale-up; and the Dijle River Restoration case, where \nthe assessment outputs were used to raise awareness and demonstrate the potential for multiple benefits \nand cost savings of employing NBS compared to grey options. Other projects may not have had the original \naim to inform future designs and implementation approaches elsewhere, but the quality and success of \nthe NBS interventions combined with the development and choice of assessments approaches have meant \nthey become knowledge hubs for other similar projects. This is the case for the Copenhagen Cloudburst \nManagement Plan case, where the Ministry of Environment has developed a national requirement to \nmunicipalities on conducting cost-effectiveness assessments in adaptation projects, based on the \napproach developed by the Municipality of Copenhagen. Also in the case of Barcelona Tree Master Plan, \nthe monitoring and evaluation design developed for tree management and the knowledge accumulated \nin the Department is frequently demanded by cities in similar climatic zones. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 45 \n\n3.3.2.3 Synergistic purposes and benefits of NBS assessments \n \nAs described in Section 2.2.1.4, expanding the purpose of NBS \nassessments outside the CCA/DRM realm to include other \nsynergistic purposes will increase the resource-effectiveness of \nan NBS assessment. Such synergistic purposes may include \nsupporting biodiversity and other environmental management \npolicies, integrating climate change mitigation, providing the data \nbasis for carbon or biodiversity compensation schemes, \nimproving understanding of benefits related to physical and \nmental health and including the considerations of social benefits \n\nand just resilience (See Section 2.2.1.4). \n \nIn terms of biodiversity, the case of Elbe Dyke Relocation illustrates how an assessment of relocating a \ndyke for biodiversity purposes developed into a CCA/DRR project after a major flood event. Today, the \ncase assessments conducted cover both flood risk mitigation and biodiversity purposes and are used for \nreplication in similar locations across Germany. The Basel Green Roof case was originally motivated by \nenergy savings although other benefits e.g., storm water management was also recognised. Today, 40% \nof flat roofs in Basel are green roofs and a requirement for green roof on new or renovated flat roofs is in \nplace in the building code in the canton. The municipality has previously conducted assessments on the \npotential for energy savings, but not in terms of storm water runoff. Long-term in-situ biodiversity \nmonitoring on 25 roofs since 2013 every two-weeks in the growing season reveal a fair share of red-listed \nspecies present. It is expected that once the long-term monitoring data has been analysed in full, there \nwill be sufficient proof of the benefit of green roofs for biodiversity such that green roofs will become \nintegrated in the national building code for flat buildings.  The Camargue Saltworks Restoration case has \nmonitored environmental impacts, including impacts of biodiversity during all phases of the project, \ncovering changes in water flow, water level, salinity, salt marsh accretion and extension and distribution \nof aquatic plants, benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water birds. The Protective Mountain Forest \nManagement case, originally focus on DRR, but increasing attention is now also to account for additional \nbenefits including wood production, biodiversity and recreation, and to integrate these into the overall \nassessment. \nIn terms of other environmental management policies, the Tulltorps\u00e5n case originally developed in 2014 \nfrom a concern of water quality and nutrient loading to the Baltic Sea. With the implementation of some \n100 NBS projects along the 30 km water course, project holders realised, thanks to the evidence from the \nassessments carried out during and ex-post, the potential for flood and drought mitigation. The \nTulltorps\u00e5n generation 2.0 case is now purely focusing on mitigating flood and drought. The Dijle River \nRestoration case conducted an ex-post social cost benefit assessment looking at multiple benefits such as \nflood control, water quality, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, air quality, recreation and landscape \nexperience. The Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan case is carrying out environmental impact \nassessments during the operational phase especially in relation to impacts of the NBS and other surface \nsolutions on water quality under the EC Water Framework Directive.  \nIn terms of physical and mental health and social benefits many of the cases recognise the importance \nof the NBS projects on direct human wellbeing including recreational activities emerging in the Camargue \nSaltworks Restoration case, in the Dijle River Restoration case, in the Tulltorps\u00e5n generation 1.0 case. \nImproved daily living qualities are well recognised, but not assessed in the case of Copenhagen Cloudburst \nManagement Plan case and the Barcelona Tree Master Plan case. In the Copenhagen Cloudburst \nManagement Plan case, several of the NBs projects are integrated with city renewal plans with a strong \ncomponent of local ownership, fostering social justice and social cohesion. \nPotential for job creation is included in the Decision Support Tool of the Resilient Forest case, and the \nmunicipality of Copenhagen also aims for export of new methods and experiences to be part of the \nCloudburst Plan. Several international collaborations are in place with cities such as New York, Buenos \nAires and Beijing, where Copenhagen provides planning and consultancy services. \n \n\nFigure 14 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 46 \n\n3.3.2.4 How were the assessments intended to be used? \n \nAs part of purposes and output needs, understanding how the \nassessments are intended to be used can help shape the \ndefinition of which type of assessments, their characteristics and \nelements and which approaches are relevant. As the cases clearly \nindicate, assessments can be used for a variety of purposes. City \nauthorities among investigated case studies (i.e., Copenhagen \nand Barcelona) used assessments to keep higher management \ncontinuously informed, keep track of progress on long-term \nstrategic management plan and in a continuous risk management \neffort, or to take strategic long-term decisions that are optimal \nand cost-effective and to help determine the most optimal \nadaptation options. Likewise, agencies responsible for mountain \nforest management and DRR in Switzerland use NBS assessments \nto support daily forest management, monitoring, re-defining \n\nregional and national strategies, in relation to rockfalls, landslide and avalanche control. And in the Elbe \nDyke relocation case, the federal agencies used the assessments to build evidence on effectiveness of \nflood risk mitigation and impacts on biodiversity in order to replicate this in similar contexts across \nGermany. \nFarmers in the case of Tulltorps\u00e5n, who founded an economic association to run the day-to-day NBS \nactivities, wished to understand the effectiveness of NBS options in quantitative terms as they have given \nup a part of their farm land to NBS and need to know \u2018is it worthwhile?\u2019. The farmers also wanted to \nunderstand the role that different methods may have on assessment results, while landowners of the \nCamargue Saltwork Restoration case use assessments to inform adaptive management during and after \nproject implementation and to enable transfer of experiences to similar locations. \nResearch institutions involved in the cases aimed to advance resilient management practices among land \nowners beyond the specific NBS case. For instance, the Resilient Forest case developed a Decision Support \nTool, introducing climate change (and their potential impacts on the forest) and Sustainable Forest \nManagement to forest managers and forest owners in Germany, Portugal and Spain. In the Basel Green \nRoof case, the monitoring was conducted by a university, aiming at informing planners and policymakers \nat local, regional and national level of the impacts of NBS in relation to biodiversity on green roofs. In the \nDijle River Restoration case, the environmental impact assessment and comparative social cost-benefit \nanalysis of the Dijle floodplain restoration assessment aimed to showcase how nature and water \nmanagement can go together, supporting arguments in favour of NBS within national agencies. \n \n\n3.3.2.5 Scale and geographical context  \n \n\nScale and geographic context are key aspects to consider in \ndefining the characteristics of assessments. Results of the \nassessment may well depend on the scale. Assessments \nidentified in the case studies range from plot scale to catchment \nscale, regional and national scale. For example, the Decision \nSupport Tool developed in the Resilient Forest case is based on \nregular site visits and stakeholder consultations in the three \ndifferent counties, which helped to clarify the needs for \nadaptation and DRR within the specific various local contexts. \nAssessments carried out in the Protective Mountain Forest case \nare partly done on plot scale (baseline assessment, in-situ \nmeasurements) as well as feed into national-scale assessment \n(national hazard map). Technical/physical NBS monitoring in the \ncase of the Barcelona Tree Master Plan accounts for the whole \n\nFigure 15 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 47 \n\ncity. Similarly, the physical, technical and economic assessments in the Copenhagen Cloudburst \nManagement Plan case cover the whole city area, but has more detailed assessment at catchment scale \nand very local and specific assessments at individual NBS implementation level. The Dijle River Restoration \ncase is delineated by the flood plain area immediately in the backyard of the city of Leuven while the Elbe \nDyke Relocation case was defined originally by the nature restoration project area. The Tulltorps\u00e5n case \nwas originally an idea with few landowners and with limited impact, which grew over a decade to cover \n30 km of the water course with today about 100 local NBS projects that in combination improved both \nwater quality and flood risk mitigation, making it the largest project of its kind in Sweden. Defining \ncharacteristics of assessments therefore need to take into account both the intended purpose and the \ndynamic context in which NBS projects often evolve. \n\n \n\n3.3.2.6 Stakeholder involvement and social vulnerability \n \nOne of the aspects to consider when defining the characteristics of \nassessments is the extent and role of stakeholder involvement. \nThe involvement of stakeholders in the in-depth cases range from \nno or only partial involvement, to extensive consultation of and cocreation with local stakeholders (e.g., residents) through to \nstakeholders themselves self-organising and forming an economic \nassociation to carry out large-scale NBS over more than a decade. \nIn the Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan case, extensive \nconsultations and citizen meetings were held on the strategic plan \nfor the Cloudburst Management Plan and dedicated co-creation \nprocesses continues to be run with residents in neighbourhoods \nwhere NBS is about to be implemented, creating a strong sense of \nownership and care. Several of the 300 NBS projects in \n\nCopenhagen are part of neighbourhood renewal plans, addressing social justice and cohesion. In \nBarcelona Tree Master Plan case, the development of the Tree Master Plan entailed an extensive \nconsultation of stakeholders, especially with all types of stakeholders, where conflicts could be expected. \nBarcelona also makes extensive use of narrative-based storylines to improve acceptance and appreciation \nof biodiversity and understanding the life that comes with a dense population of urban trees. \n \nIn the resilient forest case in Germany, Spain and Portugal, stakeholder involvement was instrumental in \nthe development of the Decision Support Tool and in the Dijle floodplain restoration project in Belgium, \nstakeholder involvement in the form of a steering committee, played an important role to discuss, refine \nand validate assessment results. The most extensive form of stakeholder involvement was found in the \nTulltorps\u00e5n case in Sweden. Here 90 farmers and more than 400 villagers and local residents are part of \nthe self-organised economic association that employs a professional project manager and a bookkeeper \nto obtain external funding to realise more than 100 projects along the river since 2014. Members of the \nassociation meet twice yearly to discuss projects, issues and progress in addition to newsletters and \nhosting numerous visitors from other regions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 16 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 48 \n\n3.3.2.7 Type of assessment approaches selected \n \n\nAll in-depth cases conducted technical and/or physical \nassessments of NBS prior to implementation and most have an \nassessment during the operational phase and ex-post to better \nunderstand the performance of NBS. Technical/physical impact \nassessments in the in-depth cases include both ex-ante, during \nthe operational phase and ex-post evaluations using both \nadvanced modelling approaches and practical measurements \nand registrations. Examples include the use of modelling, in-situ \nmeasurements, remote sensing and hydrological modelling in \nthe case of the Camargue Saltworks Restoration case and the \nProtective Mountain Forest Management case; and the use of \nfine-resolution hydrological modelling of flood risks in the \nCopenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan case. \n \n \nAn example of a tool for decision support based on physical \nimpact assessment is found in the Resilient Forest case, where \nin-situ measurements, modelling and stakeholder involvement \nare key methods within the tool. Fewer cases, however, conduct \neconomic assessments of NBS performance or carry out only \npartial economic assessments. Two comprehensive socioeconomic assessments have been carried out in relation to flood \nprotection. The Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan case \nmade an ex-ante socio-economic assessment of the optimal \nflood protection level for the whole city (K\u00f8benhavns Kommune, \n2014), followed by local level cost-effectiveness assessments, \ncomparing NBS with grey and hybrid solutions. The Dijle River \nRestoration case made an ex-post comparative social costbenefit analysis to evaluate the implemented NBS. On the \nbenefit valuation of NBS, the Tulltorps\u00e5n case carried out an expost economic valuation of seven ecosystem services enhanced \nthrough the 100 NBS projects implemented along the \nTulltorps\u00e5n river, including biodiversity, water regulation, \nnutrient retention, recreation, and tourism and using nonmarket and market-based methods. In the case of Protective \nMountain Forest Management and in the case of Camargue \nSaltworks Restoration, partial economic assessments have been \ncarried out ex-ante and/or ex-post on cost-evaluations to \nidentify the best adaptation option (including grey alternatives). \nFor the Camargue Saltworks Restoration case, economic aspects \nwere assessed ex-ante qualitatively and ex-post quantitatively. \nThe Barcelona Tree Master Plan and the Resilient Forests cases \nboth plan or would like to include cost-benefit analyses of NBS \nin future assessments. \n \nMonitoring during the operational and ex-post phase played a \nkey role in several of the cases. For the Barcelona Tree Master \nPlan case, a systematic and 2-year cycle of qualitative and \nquantitative monitoring of individual tree health combined with \na complaint registration system from residents about nuisances \nensures that Barcelona can safely maintain a 25% canopy cover \n\nFigure 18 \n\nFigure 17 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 49 \n\nin a dense urban area and continue to increase the extent of urban trees up to 30% and avoid accidents. \nFor Tulltorps\u00e5n, a continued monitoring of e.g., peak flow at the mouth of the river documented the \nimpact of the circa 100 NBS project established along the 30km Tulltorps\u00e5n river. Peak flow as a result has \nreduced from 12m3/sec to 5m3/sec in winter months, leading to an absence of flooding. Also the Elbe Dyke \nRelocation case continues to monitor both flood risk effectiveness and biodiversity development on the \nsite. In the Protective Mountain Forest Management case, monitoring is a key method of ongoing \nmaintenance and operations with a cycle of systematic indicator-based monitoring of forests every 5 \nyears, post-disaster evaluation of NBS effectiveness and post-disaster assessment of needs of NBS \nimprovement. In Basel Green Roofs case, ex-post indicator-based monitoring has taken place twice \nmonthly in the growing season for more than 10 years, registering development of biodiversity on green \nroofs. \n \nOne case \u2013 Barcelona Tree Master Plan \u2013 explicitly makes use of narrative-based storylines to improve \nacceptance and appreciation of biodiversity and increase residents\u2019 understanding of the type of life that \ncomes with a dense population of urban trees. \n \n\n3.3.2.8 Funding & Budget for assessments of NBS \n \n\nAssessments of NBS are \ngenerally funded by either the \nproject holder itself via the local \n\nauthority budget (e.g., Barcelona Tree Master Plan and the Copenhagen Cloudburst Management plan), \nby national funding bodies especially interested in understanding the effectiveness of the projects (e.g., \nthe National Environmental Agency in the case of Basel Green Roofs and the multiple federal and regional \nfunding streams to the Elbe Dyke Relocation case) or by funding bodies at national or EU level of the \nprojects, requiring assessments as part of the grant (e.g., the Camargue Salt Works Restoration and the \nDijle River Restoration). Funding bodies include LIFE+, Interreg, Rural Development Programme, national, \nregional and local funding. A few exceptions include the Resilient Forest case with 40 % funding coming \nfrom private sources and the Tulltorps\u00e5n generation 2.0 case, which is based on autonomous adaptation \nof an individual large-scale farmer, securing part funding from NEFCO and WWF for the adjustable \ndrainage system and with the plans to seek funding from the up-coming Rural Development Programme, \nwhen it allows applications on water storage for countering droughts. Many of the projects have a \ndiversified portfolio of funding sources. Two cases - Tulltorps\u00e5n and Elbe Dyke Relocation \u2013 created \nassociations specifically with the aim of being able to obtain funding from different sources, including \nfunding for assessments of NBS. \n \nIn several of the cases, NBS assessments are considered extremely important. In the case of Copenhagen \nCloudburst Management Plan, the cost-effectiveness and socio-economic assessments primarily serve to \navoid maladaptation and poor use of public finance. With a total implementation budget of up to 1.8 \nbillion EUR (2011 prices), a poorly made or a lack of assessment can risk leading to significant misinvestments. In the case of Tulltorps\u00e5n, the farmers behind the project place a high importance in \nunderstanding the effectiveness of the measures taken on their land. The benefits of the NBS projects \nneed to outweigh the costs of giving up part of their land for remeandering and construction of wetlands. \nAlso, in the case of Tulltorps\u00e5n, the success of the project led the national Agency for Sea and Water to \nfund an extensive evaluation of the project to better understand underlying success factors. In the case of \nBarcelona Tree Master Plan, the very ambitious agenda of working with a high canopy cover in a dense \nurban environment requires the city to run a systematic and constant monitoring and registration of \nincidents linked to tree debris, potentially leading to health and safety risks. In the mountain case in \nSwitzerland, regular assessments (e.g., assessing performance NBS) are required by national legislation. \n \nOne of the cases \u2013 Basel Green Roof \u2013 does not anymore rely on public funding for the implementation of \nthe NBS. Starting out as a voluntary subsidy to homeowners in 1996 from an energy savings fund, green \n\nFigure 19 \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 50 \n\nroofs for flat buildings are now part of the building code in Basel canton. The first biodiversity monitoring \nwas also paid from the energy savings fund and is now covered by the Federal Ministry of Environment. \n \n\n3.3.2.9 Drivers of assessment \n \nDrivers of conducting NBS assessments in the projects include specific requirements from funding bodies, \npolicy or/and demands and questions from the field. \nIn the case of the Basel Green Roof case, the funding aimed specifically at carrying out monitoring of \nbiodiversity. Similarly, in the case of Camargue Saltworks Restoration, performing an assessment was \nrequired by the used funding mechanisms. National guidelines for risk management were one of the key \nreasons for carrying out an NBS assessment in the Protective Forest Management case. Demands and \nquestions from the field to ascertain the options and effectiveness of NBS led to the development of a \ndecision support tool in the case of Resilient Forests, where forest managers needed alternatives to \nexpensive forest management practices. This was also found in the case of Tulltorps\u00e5n, where farmers \nwanted to understand and to follow over time the impacts and benefits of giving up their land for river \nrestoration and wetland construction. Interestingly, farmers in the Tulltorps\u00e5n case also asked for \nevaluating the different assessment methods to ensure robust evaluation approaches. For the untested \ncustomised drainage system that the Tulltorps\u00e5n plan to implement in order to counter drought events in \nagriculture, the funding organisation NEFCO required a two-Step approach to the project, starting with \nthe pre-feasibility study before deciding on moving further on to the detailed technical study and \nimplementation. \n \nA number of cases have implemented NBS assessments as part of local and national policy agendas: In the \ncase of Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, the extensive body of assessments were motivated by \nthe need to avoid misinvestment and ensure optimal flood protection for the whole city while ensuring \nadded values and synergies with wider agendas of neighbourhood renewal and increasing liveability. In \nthe case of Barcelona Tree Master Plan, the systematic monitoring of tree health and safety to prevent \nany health hazards for residents is considered the prerequisite for having a very dense canopy cover in \nthe dense urban area. In the case of the Dijle river restoration, the water management agency requested \nan assessment comparing grey and NBS options to showcase a good example of NBS. In the case of the \nElbe Dyke Relocation, the size and importance of the project as the first of its kind in Germany motivated \nthe federal Agency for Hydraulic Construction to conduct detailed assessments and monitoring of the \neffects of dyke relocation on flood reduction. \n \n\n3.3.2.10 Barriers & success factors for NBS \n \nBarriers \n \nWorking with NBS in practice necessitates interdisciplinary approaches and collaborations. However, \nworking in multi-disciplinary teams requires both time and dedicated processes to understand each other \nand integrate different views. Projects have also faced methodological challenges e.g., due to lack of data. \n \nInitial scepticism among stakeholders (Tulltorps\u00e5n case) or a lack of local acceptance or even local \nopposition (Camargue Saltwork Restoration case) have proven to be barriers to reckon with. The projects \ndemonstrate, however, that by informing, involving and especially demonstrating the robustness of NBS \nin solving challenges, initial local resistance can be turned around. \n \nA lack of integration across policy areas can lead to unintended consequences, for instance between urban \ncloudburst management using NBS and the EU Water Framework Directive (Copenhagen Cloudburst \nManagement Plan case). NBS for cloudburst management retains water that is ultimately led to surface \nwater bodies without going through a waste water treatment plant. The Water Framework Directive \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 51 \n\nhowever requires security that water quality is not deteriorated by introducing NBS, while in the absence \nof acting, the city would not be subject to the same requirements. Also retroactively introduced national \nregulations on NBS assessment for climate adaptation in Denmark has shown to delay and introduce \nuncertainty in planning and implementation. Furthermore, the implementation of NBS measures and \nassessing their effectiveness can require the participation and collaboration of multiple actors including \nland users, decision makers in public administration and citizens. Building relationships and facilitating a \nfruitful participatory process can be key for enhancing the chances of success, but it can take several years \n(e.g., Elbe Dyke Relocation). \n \nFor NBS projects that operate over long time periods and that are dependent on external funding (e.g., \nTulltorps\u00e5n case), the excessive time and efforts spent on securing external funding and reporting to \nfunding bodies, especially when multiple funding bodies are involved, can be experienced as a nuisance. \nAlso, inflexible funding rules that do not allow novel types of NBS have been shown to delay \nimplementation. An example is the Tulltorps\u00e5n case, where the status of the socio-economic association \nthat farmers had created in order to apply for external funding was not eligible to apply for funding. \nHowever, the promising approach of Tulltorps\u00e5n led the funding agency to alter rules to allow considering \napplications from that type of applicant. \n \nTotal economic value of NBS (e.g., including also non-market use and non-use benefits of NBS) is rarely \nquantified in assessments of NBS, even if case owners find this important and relevant. In the case of \nCopenhagen Cloudburst Management, the socio-economic assessment excluded non-market values of \nNBS despite these values being key aspects that citizens and politicians demand (e.g., increasing urban \ngreen areas, improve biodiversity and recreation opportunities). This type of values was excluded to avoid \npotential criticism, based on the explicit exclusion of non-market benefit valuation in national guidance of \nsocio-economic assessments of public investments made by the Danish Ministry of Finance. The lack of \nassessing the total economic value of NBS may bias conclusions and remove attention to maximising cobenefits of NBS implementation. \n \nBudgets appear in most of the nine cases not to be a major barrier or have been solved over time. In the \nBarcelona Tree Master Plan case, however, the allocated budgets fail to follow the level of ambitions set \nout in politically agreed strategies. \n \nSuccesses \n \nStakeholder involvement have in several of the nine cases shown to play an important role for a robust \nNBS assessment. In the Resilient Forest case, the involvement of stakeholders brought up new relevant \ntopics (e.g., biodiversity) that were not foreseen in the project planning. In Tulltorps\u00e5n case, the selforganisation of stakeholders and direct interest of land owners in understanding the effectiveness and \nimpact of NBS on their land has spurred an impressive number of systematic assessments since the project \nstart in 2014. \nDemonstrating the insurance value of NBS through detailed technical/physical and economic assessments \nis considered to be a competition factor for the city of Copenhagen. The implementation of the cloudburst \nplan on neighbourhood level protects households against a 1:100 extreme rain event. This collective \ninvestment, paid by residents via the utility bills and municipal taxes represents an insurance value that \ncould be used to decrease individual insurance costs of households, or at a more generic level to avoid an \nincrease in the re-insurance costs for insurance companies. This also stabilizes property values and \nimproves opportunities for investing in Copenhagen, as risks from climate change impacts are under \ncontrol. \n \nAssessments that are policy-driven with a clear mandate and objectives have the clear advantage that it's \nnot necessary to convince people about the virtues of carrying out evaluations (e.g., Dijle River Restoration \ncase). Also, adverse events causing significant damages and general recognition of climate hazards have \nshown to be conducive for embarking on ex-ante assessments (Elbe Dyke Relocation case, Copenhagen \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 52 \n\nCloudburst Management Plan case), although adverse events can hardly be coined a success factor by and \nof itself. \nSystematic monitoring of NBS has proven to significantly reduce health and safety risks in the case of urban \ntrees in Barcelona. Politicians have come to recognise the value and importance of systematic monitoring \nthrough the absence of serious accidents from falling branches and trees, which also makes it possible to \nimplement the ambitious strategy to further increase canopy cover in Barcelona. Without such continuous \nrisk assessments based on monitoring, it would not be possible to avoid serious accidents, and politicians \nwould not be comfortable pushing for urban tree expansion. \nSufficient data availability for conducting assessments is an important prerequisite for successful \nevaluations. The extensive amount of data on buildings, infrastructure, hydrology and socio-economic \ndata on residents in Copenhagen made it possible to carry out a city-wide assessment on flood risks, costeffectiveness of NBS measures and cost-benefit assessment of different flood risk levels. \n \nEx-post assessments in projects where NBS has clearly made a rapid and positive impact (e.g., on flood \nprotection and biodiversity) have in several cases been used to showcase the potential for NBS to other \nregions (e.g., Dijle River Restoration, Elbe Dyke Relocation, Tulltorps\u00e5n). Planning, assessments and \nimplementation of NBS at large-scale in Copenhagen has spurred international interest and collaborations \nwith cities like New York Buenos Aires and Beijing, where the municipality of Copenhagen provides \nplanning and consultancy services and welcomes many delegations since 2012 to learn from the \nexperiences of NBS implementation on the ground. Similarly, the Elbe Dyke Relocation case served as a \npilot site for a NBS measure for flood mitigation attracting national and international experts and decision \nmakers interested in replicating a similar measure elsewhere. For enhancing the acceptance of and local \nsupport for NBS measures it can be critical to assess also the multiple benefits that NBS measures provide \nin addition to their benefits for adaptation and disaster risk management. Such an assessment can address \neconomic benefits including the creation of jobs (e.g. the area of the Elbe Dyke Relocation enhanced the \nattractiveness of the landscape and increased the local tourism sector) but also intrinsic values related to \nscenic beauty and sense of place. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 53 \n\n4 Conclusions \n \nNature-based solutions play an important and increasing role in both adaptation and disaster risk \nmanagement. This is also recognized within several global and European agreements and policies (e.g., \nUN\u2019s SFDRR, EU Green Deal, the EU Adaptation Strategy) which embed NBS as a means to address CCA \nand DRR as well as other societal challenges (e.g., biodiversity loss, climate mitigation). This calls for fitfor-purpose assessments, which critically assess the suitability of NBS for addressing climate change and \nother hazard impacts and monitor the success of their implementation, to inform (future) policies and \nactions, as well as evaluate implemented policies. \nThere are several NBS assessment frameworks suggested (see e.g., EC 2021). However, navigating the \ncomplexity of design options and possible methods for NBS assessments remains a challenge. Here, we \ndeveloped a step-wise framework for designing user-oriented NBS assessments, building on key success \nfactors and limitations identified in the literature. The framework consists of four recommended steps: 1) \nclear identification of the purpose and specific goal(s) and outputs that address stakeholder needs,  \n2) defining assessment characteristics balancing the purpose and output needs with resource \nconsiderations, 3) selection of elements to be included in the assessment, such as technical, \nenvironmental, social or/and economic and finally, 4) choice of the assessment approach or a mix of \napproaches (combined, embedded or used in sequence). Each NBS assessment will have its unique \nindividual pattern addressing its particular context and purpose. In this study, we used real-life NBS cases \nimplemented across the EU to illustrate and discuss a range of different NBS assessments approaches in \nthe context of CCA and DRR (see Annex 1 for an overview), and reflect on the key elements of the \nsuggested framework. \n \nStrategic planning of NBS assessments for CCA and DRM \nAn early strategic planning of all required NBS assessments throughout the CCA/DRM cycle would ensure \nthe necessary flow of information on NBS and its performance from the initial planning and design choices \nto monitoring and evaluation. It shows to allow both optimal design of NBS based on best available \nknowledge, continuous monitoring and calibration and may inform NBS upgrades, upscaling and future \nNBS implementation, as illustrated by the Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan and Protective \nMountain Forest Management. However, in several other real-life cases the choice of assessment \napproach (incl. the required assessment characteristics, elements and methods) often evolved or needed \nto be adjusted over the life time of the project (with increasing experience, knowledge and/or local \nuptake) and hence could not easily be planned in an early stage (e.g., Elbe Dyke Relocation, Tulltorps\u00e5n). \nTherefore, planning strategically, but allowing for flexibility further down the line may be the most \nprudent approach. \n \nMultiple entry points in the CCA and DRM cycle \nApplication of NBS assessment for adaptation to climate change and/or disaster risk reduction (e.g., flood \nand drought risk management, erosion control, heat resilience) are the common elements in all the \nsurveyed cases. NBS assessments carried out in the analysed in-depth cases have been serving various \nentry points in the CCA and DRM cycles. In several projects, there is a natural overlap between CCA and \nDRR activities (e.g., Camargue Saltworks Restoration, Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan). \nAssessment approaches applied in the cases vary from ex-ante (including technical feasibility and \neffectiveness assessments, and cost-benefits analysis), to operational and ex-post assessments (including \nindicator-based assessments and monitoring). \n \nIn the ex-ante phase of the project cycle, assessment approaches were commonly applied in order to \nidentify adaptation (CCA cycle step 3) and/or DRM measures, to provide a robust evidence base about \nbenefits and trade-offs of choosing between different options (green, grey, hybrid) and to assess the \ntechnical effectiveness of NBS for risk reduction and enhancing resilience (e.g., by the use of computerbased modelling tools to compare different scenarios or/and options, as illustrated in the Elbe Dyke \nRelocation and Forest Resilient). Several of the cases explicitly recognise the value of providing assessment \ndata and insights to a wider audience for scale-up and replication purposes (e.g., Elbe Dyke Relocation \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 54 \n\nserved as a pilot sites and has been replicated in other sites; or the economic assessment developed in \nthe Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan have been an inspiration for national requirements in \nadaptation strategies and projects). On the other hand, relatively few cases aimed to assess potential costs \nof implementation and maintenance in support of budget planning or to assess project\u2019s economic \nparameters to build the business case for implementation. The exclusion of the latter in current \nassessment applications may present a limitation, especially for those situations where the building of a \nstrong business case matters greatly \u2013 such as when raising private capital investments or lending for NBS \nimplementation. \n \nIn the operational phase, assessments are applied during the implementation of the adaptation options \n(CCA cycle Step 5), including for monitoring and evaluation (CCA cycle Step 6, all stages in DRM cycle), as \npart of ongoing maintenance and operation of NBS interventions. All case study assessments applied in \nthe operational phase aimed to build an understanding and an evidence base on the functioning of NBS, \nas well as several assessments were also used to verify the NBS or identify design improvements for \npossible scale-ups and replications (e.g., Elbe Dyke Relocation). Relatively few cases aimed to use \nassessments for calibration purposes of models or NBS itself, while none of the cases aimed to explicitly \nassess and report expenditures and benefit ratios during the NBS operation. As mentioned before, the \nongoing exclusion of the economic parameters also in the operational phase assessments may deepen the \nknowledge gap on the economic performance of NBS as measures for CCA and DRM. The best practice \nobserved in cases suggests that operation phase assessments are an important element for NBS upscaling \nand replication in a continuous refinement and improvement cycle as we continue to build our \nunderstanding on NBS performance. \n \nIn the ex-post phase of NBS projects, the assessments focussed on monitoring and evaluation of NBS \neffectiveness and performance (CCA cycle Step 6, post-disaster stage in DRM cycle) (e.g., Barcelona Tree \nMaster Plan, Basel Green Roofs, Protective Mountain Forest Management, Elbe Dyke Relocation). Most \ncases aimed to specifically assess the risk reduction or resilience increase effects achieved by the \nimplemented NBS. Several cases explicitly aimed to build a knowledge base to inform future designs, \nfunding and implementation approaches. However, none of the cases aimed to assess the return on \ninvestment made. Interestingly, only one case evaluated the full societal benefits ex-post through a \ncomparative social cost-benefit assessment (Dijle River Restoration), however, several of the cases \nindicated plans or the wish to include evaluations of full societal benefits. The reason for not undertaking \nsuch an assessments appear to be either a lack of expertise, that the project is not sufficiently advanced \nenough or a limitation in a national guidance for carrying out socio-economic assessments of public \nprojects. Thus, although the social element is likewise one of the least-assessed, there appears to be clear \ninterest in integrating it in the assessments as it is also the case for the economic element. That may be \nexplained by the intended purposes and planned uses of assessment results, which in the observed cases \nwere often geared towards building the evidence-base for NBS effectiveness and supporting stakeholder \ncommunication and public policy design. \n \nIntegration of synergistic purposes  \nSeveral assessments do not focus on climate impact/risk reduction only, but also considered other \nsynergistic purposes the assessment may serve outside the CCA/DRM realm (multi-purpose assessment). \nThis wider perspective may offer higher efficiencies as one assessment may serve several needs (or \npurposes) in different policy and decision-making areas and support the buy-in of NBS projects across a \nwider group of stakeholders. This notion has also been supported by the analysed case studies, which \noften have been developed with a wider perspective (e.g., to also account for restoring habitats, \nenhancing biodiversity or/and recreation opportunities). Especially the synergistic link between \nbiodiversity and CCA/DRR is apparent in most cases (e.g., the Elbe Dyke Relocation, Dijle River Restoration, \nResilient Forest), although biodiversity was commonly mentioned as an additional benefit rather than a \ncriterion for implementing or denoting NBS in the first place. Other synergistic purposes include \nsupporting environmental management policies (e.g., water quality), physical health and social benefits \n(e.g., recreation) and job creation (e.g., in tourism, biomass production). \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 55 \n\nThe multi-purpose assessments might require higher levels of collaboration (e.g., between departments \nworking on climate change, biodiversity, health, transport, social aspects etc.), pooling of resources and \nbroader stakeholder engagement but may also build a stronger business case for NBS, as they recognise \nthe multitude of benefits NBS provide beyond their CCA/DRM purpose, thus accentuating NBS advantages \nover other types of CCA/DRM solutions, which have a more limited scope of co-benefits. These larger \ncross-department collaborations may likewise allow assembling resources from several budget streams \nboth to support the assessment and also for the implementation of the NBS itself.  \n \nLevel of stakeholder engagement depends on the purpose \nIn line with other studies (EC, 2021), our analysis highlights the relevance of co-productive approaches \ntaking into account different knowledge, expertise and lived experiences of many stakeholders, for \ndesigning robust NBS impact assessments. Thereby, several iterations might be needed to allow \nstakeholder involvement in the co-design of the assessment, creation of ownership and care of the NBS \nmeasure. The cases illustrate that especially where NBS has an impact on land owners or residents, \nstakeholder involvement and co-design was key to ensuring understanding, buy-in and ownership, but \nalso to improve the design and the assessment approach (e.g., include assessment purposes that are also \nin the interest of stakeholders). Where the assessment is of a technical nature and the NBS does not \ndirectly have an influence on stakeholders, high levels of involvement, especially of external stakeholders, \nwas not necessarily needed, as it was seen in the case of continuous risk assessments and biodiversity \nassessments based on monitoring (e.g., the Basel Green Roof, Protective Forest Mountain Management). \nThe highest degree of stakeholder involvement in the purpose and choice of assessments was found in \nthe Tulltorps\u00e5n case, where stakeholders (i.e., farmers, local residents) were not only instrumental in \nidentifying and selecting the required assessment approach, but also asked for investigations into the \npotential impact that the choice of methods would have. The stakeholders initiated and organised the \ncreation of an economic association to enable collaboration among several land owners and to inform a \nlegal entity capable of applying for external funding for carrying out NBS measures along the Tulltorps\u00e5n \nwater course.  \n \nClosely working with local residents by making use of extensive public consultations and co-creation \nprocesses have also proven to lead to strong ownership and care of NBS measures implemented (e.g., \nCopenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan, Barcelona Tree Master Plan). Involving stakeholders in the \ninitial planning and design choice (e.g., by site visits, workshop, individual meetings) allows project holders \nto develop a robust and useful assessment which match with stakeholders needs enhancing buy-in and \ninterest in assessment outcomes (e.g., Resilient Forest). These findings in real-life cases reinforce the \ntheoretical framework, which indicates that the considerations on the appropriate level of stakeholder \nengagement is a key characteristic that needs to be considered and will differ in line with the assessment \npurpose and planned use of results. Therefore, it cannot be treated as a one-fits-all aspect. Moreover, \nworking in multi-disciplinary teams requires both time and dedicated processes to understand each other \nand integrate different views, which can be experienced as a barrier to overcome. Hence, NBS projects \nand related assessments can take years up to decades to reach its full scale of implementation (e.g. Elbe \nDyke Relocation). \n \nLack of assessments accounting for economic and social elements \nAlthough a key argument for NBS is its often presumed cost-effectiveness as compared to a technical \nsolution, the majority of cases expressed NBS benefits in technical and/or (bio)physical terms rather than \nin economic terms. This suggests that an economic valuation has not been a prerequisite for raising \nsupport for an NBS initiative in the investigated cases. It is unclear whether the inclusion of economic \nindicators in the analysed case assessments would have led to additional positive outcomes. Social \nbenefits and impacts have not been in focus in the investigated cases, although many of them have \nidentified and made some qualitative assessments. However, none of the cases looked specifically at just \nresilience and how CCA and DRR may or may not impact different groups differently. \n \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 56 \n\nFunding & budget \nSeveral NBS cases from the survey described the lack of funding as a common reason for not conducting \n(desired or additional) assessments. The cases studied in-depth, reported a diversified portfolio of funding \nsources including local, national and EU funding, and sometimes also private sources. Two cases created \nassociations specifically with the aim to enable them to obtain funding from different sources (Tulltorps\u00e5n, \nElbe Dyke Relocation). For NBS projects that operate over long time periods and that are dependent on \nexternal funding (e.g., Tulltorps\u00e5n), the extra time and efforts spent on securing external funding and \nreporting to funding bodies, especially when multiple funding bodies are involved, can be experienced as \na nuisance. \n \nDrivers for NBS assessments \nThe key motivating drivers for conducting NBS assessments in the cases included specific requirements \nfrom funding bodies (e.g., Basel Green Roof, Dijle River Restoration), local and national policy mandates \n(e.g., Copenhagen Cloudburst management Plan, Protective Forest management) or/and stakeholder \ndemands and questions from the field (e.g., Resilient Forest, Tulltorps\u00e5n). Anchoring assessment \nrequirements in local and national policies and funding requirements is therefore an important factor to \nensure that assessments are included when planning NBS projects. If NBS assessments are well designed, \nthe generated information can help building political support from local administration up to the highest \npolitical level and facilitate the upscaling and replication of NBS measures (e.g., Elbe Dyke Relocation). \n \nIn conclusion, successful design and implementation of NBS assessments rely on various aspects to be \nconsidered, and the choice of the assessment approach is often based on an iterative process of identifying \nthe purpose, characteristics, elements and approaches of assessments. Particular for the initiation (exante) and/or evaluation (ex-post) of NBS projects, NBS assessments have shown to play a critical role in \nproviding information that is of relevance for stakeholders and for generating awareness, building trust \nand to showcase the potential for NBS to other sites. Using assessments which allow to account for \nperspectives that go beyond CCA and DRR (e.g., combination of biodiversity and flood protection) have \nshown to provide opportunities to enhance the buy-in of NBS projects across a wider group of \nstakeholders (including political support). Depending on the purpose of the assessments, collaboration \namong diverse sets of stakeholders can be beneficial to initiate and optimize assessments and NBS \nmeasures. However, working in multi-disciplinary teams needs time and the need for it needs to be \ncritically assessed based on assessment purpose and available resources. The importance of NBS \nassessments to build evidence on technical, environmental, social and economic performance is \nparamount for replication in similar contexts and up-scaling up to larger scales. The suggested step-wise \nframework for designing NBS assessments developed in this report is hopefully a useful step in this \ndirection. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 57 \n\n5 References  \n \nAltamirano, M., de Rijke, H., Basco Carrera, L., & Arellano Jaimerena, B.

The \nproject [name] is part of a total of 97 cases that are analysed in the upcoming EEA report \u2018Nature-based \nSolutions and ecosystem-based approaches for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction\u2019. \nThe EEA report will be published late April 2021 and we will be happy to send you the link once it is \npublished. \n \nThe EEA is interested - through analysis and synthesis of evidence and practice - in supporting the case for \nnature-based solutions as effective and low-regret ways of solving many societal challenges linked to the \nenvironment and climate change in both rural and urban contexts.  \nWe are currently looking into if and how nature-based initiatives in practice have applied assessments and \nmonitoring either before, during or after implementation. The aim of this information is to provide good \nexamples and experience from the field to policy makers across Europe on how to go about deciding on \nand assessing nature-based projects. The experience from your project is therefore important. \nAssessments can be qualitative or quantitative and can help evaluate if a project or initiative is desirable, \nhow to best design and implement it and also to learn from projects after implementation. \n \nWe would be very interested to know the following (brief answers are sufficient): \n\u2022 What was/is the main purpose/benefit of the project? \n\u2022 What do you consider the main additional benefits of the project? \n\u2022 Did you do a qualitative assessment of the project (before, during or after)? \n\n- If yes \u2013 what type and when in the project cycle? \n- If no \u2013 why did you choose not to a qualitative assessment? \n\n\u2022 Did you do a quantitative assessment of the project (before, during or after)? \n- If yes \u2013 what type and when in the project cycle? \n- If no \u2013 why did you choose not to a quantitative assessment? \n\n\u2022 Do you have or did you have monitoring of how the nature-based initiative works out? \n- If yes, what kind of metric or indicator are you measuring or have you used? \n- If no, why is or was no monitoring put in place? \n\n \nIf you are not specifically involved in this NBS project or initiative, could you please point us the correct \nperson(s) to be contacted? \n \nWe look very much forward to receiving your response. \n \nBest wishes. \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 3 \n\nAnnex 3 - Interview guide: deployment of assessments in NBS projects for CCA/DRR \n \nDRR/Adaptation project \n \n1.

Its high population \ndensity also magnifies the local heat island effect, \nwhich causes an array of health and \nenvironmental challenges. Climate change \nprojections include a rise in average temperature \nand a significant decrease in rainfall, with \nexpected lasting droughts and intense heat \nwaves. In response, Barcelona has committed to \nbecoming a global model of a sustainable city \ncombating urban development challenges related \nto climate change and population density. In this \ncontext, Barcelona has been focusing on planting \nand managing trees for many years and developed \nthe \u201cTrees for living. Barcelona Tree Master Plan \n2017-37\u201d, in lines with the goal of the Barcelona \nGreen Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020 \n(BGIBP). The Barcelona Tree Master Plan aligns its \nobjectives with the wider City development \nobjectives, making the Barcelona Tree Master \nPlan far more than a tree management plan. \n \n \n \n \nPhoto: Roy, Barcelona Municipality \n \n\nRole of Adaptation / DRR: Climate adaptation is one of 5 main objectives in the Barcelona Tree Master \nPlan 2017-2037. The five objectives include i) generate real green infrastructure that achieves the \nmaximum value and connectivity with its urban and natural surroundings; ii) improve both the urban and \nnatural environment; iii) obtain maximum possible ecosystem services from trees including a high level of \nbiodiversity and ensuring good conditions that are felt safe and enhance identity; iv) develop a biomass \nthat is adapted, resilient and which can be used as a measure to adapt to climate change; and v) obtain \ngood co-existence between the general public and trees, and encourage society to value trees more from \na socio-cultural objective. \n \nNBS measures implemented: NBS measures implemented include the selection, afforestation and \nmanagement of urban trees. The climate adaptation benefits include modifying the urban microclimate \nand tempering the climate conditions by providing cooling through shade and transpiration. In addition, \nthe reflection of sunlight by the leaves lowers the temperature in pedestrian areas and the shade protects \npeople from the sun, especially during the hottest months. Furthermore, urban trees can prevent possible \nlocal flooding by helping to reduce the amount of storm water runoff. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: Barcelona conducts a lot of systematic assessments both on the \ntrees (health, biodiversity, risks, nuisances) and on the impacts of trees on environmental indicators \n(temperature, air quality, water management) over many years. Assessments relating to trees are \nconducted by the Department of Technical Services and Parcs, while the environmental indicators are \nmonitored by the Environment Agency. \nTechnical/physical NBS impact assessments: Barcelona conducts a systematic 2-year cycle of stock-taking \nand accounting, recording the number of trees, the condition of trees, the number of incidents, complaints \nfrom neighbours (indicator of quality), trees collapsing and branches dropping, as well as allergens and \nother nuisances. Evaluation of every single tree is also conducted in a 2-year cycle to assess the health, \nsafety and management needs of the trees. Safety is of utmost importance in this tree dense city. \nIndicators: The Technical/physical assessments take place in the operational phase and include both \nqualitative and quantitative data that is spatially and temporally specific and linked to natural science. \nMethods: The methods are based on in-situ measurements and are risk based. Most of the assessments \nare indicator-based. Tools include mapping, GIS and inventories. The Department is starting to assess the \nvariability of data based on some modelling. Sensors are not used extensively and 3D modelling is not (yet) \nin use in this field. Stakeholder assessments are collated through a registration system of complaints that \ncan point to areas with a problem (even if perceived) and functions as an effective indicator. The \nDepartment explicitly uses a strong narrative-based approach on biodiversity to keep informing people \nabout why biodiversity is good and why it\u2019s good to have birds and insects in the vicinity of where people \nlive. Life-cycle assessments has become part of Spanish Law and the Department is very interested in this. \nMulti-criteria assessments are typically done in SUDS projects in the implementation phase, but not yet \nwith urban tree plans, but is increasingly recognised. Unformalised, long-term knowledge of the people \nworking in the Department is central to assessments, adding critical context and experience to data and \ntools. \nEconomic impact: The City plans to appraise the economic impacts of the urban trees. The tools and \nindicators are not in place yet, but it\u2019s in the plans to evaluate this. \nHuman/social/cultural impacts: This topic is included in the plan, but is not currently followed-up. \nEnvironmental impact: Assessments on the quality of air, including PM10, and temperature are closely \nmonitored by the Environment Agency. Monitoring the urban heat island effect is ongoing. VOCs from \ntrees are not monitored. A study carried out years past found that only few of the species cause this \nproblem. Compared to other sources, trees were found to contribute only negligibly and hence this kind \nof assessment is stopped. \nThe Department of technical services and planning has a strong biodiversity monitoring programme with \nseveral plans of action butterflies, birds, pest insects. The city uses biological control only. \nRecently, an atlas of biodiversity in Barcelona has been launched to check the presence and approximate \nnumbers. This will be used in future to assess whether and how the trees contribute to enhancing \nbiodiversity. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: The main purpose of the NBS assessment relate to the adaptation cycle. The \nentry Steps involve \u201cassessing adaptation options\u201d and \u201cmonitoring and evaluation\u201d. For the \u201cmonitoring \nand evaluation\u201d the City conducts both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.  An emphasis is on \nrisk assessment on the health and safety of the trees related to the management of trees. This is gathered \nin an extensive database that is used in the \u201cassessing adaptation options\u201d Step, where the City conducts \nquantitative regression analysis to understand correlations between tree species and health and risk \nchallenges (allergies, branch falling, pests) to continuously improve on the selection and location of tree \nspecies and keep track of how trees develop. \nBesides CCA, the assessments included following additional purposes: i) water management (results of \ntheir work show an overall declining or constant water consumption for trees despite a significant increase \nin green infrastructure and a need to water individual trees longer. Current water consumption levels are \nconsidered low); ii) green space management; iii) biodiversity enhancement; iv) air quality; v) place \nregeneration (as part of urban design); vi) knowledge and social capacity building for sustainable urban \ntransformation (through consultation with road engineers and architects); viii) health and wellbeing. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\n \nDrivers of assessment (reason for \nchoosing the method) : The reason for \nchoosing this finely meshed, thorough \nand systematic monitoring of all trees in \nthe city is effectiveness in ensuring safety \nfor people. Fatalities are very rare and \nhave serious legal ramifications. The \ncontinued and systematic monitoring of \ntrees helps assure the Department they \nreduce safety risks to a minimum and \nultimately secures the continuation of \nthe Tree Master Plan. \n \nPhoto: Roy, Barcelona Municipality \n\n \nAlthough budgets could be larger to accompany the growing number of trees, the Department has an \noptimal monitoring and assessment in place. \n \nUse of assessment outputs : Monthly reporting is made to higher management. When trends are \nidentified, action is considered, e.g.,less planting of a species or more pruning. Every year, challenges are \nrevisited and updated. This is predominantly for internal use. The knowledge accumulated and active in \nthe Department is frequently demanded by cities in similar climatic zones, but strategic documentation \nfor external use is not developed. The Department is very active presenting in workshops and conferences.  \nThe City assesses the progress and impacts of the Master Plan during the operational phase, which runs \nuntil 2037. The City uses the assessments to improve decision making in relation to urban design, urban \nplanning, to increase resource efficiency and recourse consumption. The assessments keep track of how \nfar the City is from meeting challenges for 2037 (indicators of progress): increase 5% of green coverage in \nthe city; increase the city\u2019s tree cover by 5% to achieve 30% of the city surface covered by tree canopy, at \nleast 40% of species adapted to climate changes (today 30% level adaptation), reduce the presence of a \ngiven tree species to max. 15% of the total population within the urban area to increase biodiversity \n(increases resilience towards pests), and ensure that all children in primary schools appreciate and can \nidentify the trees in their neighbourhood. \nAn inventory of species has been made over several years. All decisions are based on data and experience. \n \nFunding and budget: The funding is public and the tree planting, monitoring and maintenance is part of \nthe general budget of the Department. The budget is renegotiated annually. Despite the ambitious \nimplementation to expand the number of trees and increase the biodiversity and resilience of the tree \nstock in the city, budgets tend to remain constant. \n \nProvisions/structures in place for carrying out long-term assessments: Long term funding is made \navailable for the systematic assessment of trees in Barcelona as well as the monitoring of air quality, \ntemperatures and water management. A tree assessment team working around the clock ensures the \ncontinuous focus \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: Before the Master Tree Plan came into force in 2017, the City \nhad an extensive and thorough consultation and debate with stakeholders. This included citizens, people \nworking in the streets, architects, water managers, staff monitoring and analysing air quality and engineers \nand technical staff responsible for lighting and other urban services \u2013 basically any place with a potential \nfor conflict. \nThe systematic registration of all complaints regarding real or perceived nuisances with trees ensures the \ncity is able to always address and be in contact with residents. \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nBarriers & success factors for the NBS assessments: Barriers: Budgets do not necessarily follow the \nincreased workload with systematically assessing a growing number of trees. One barrier is the inability to \nincrease expenditure and push the budget beyond the current level. Technical knowledge may limit the \npossibility to expand the team, if budgets would allow this. Success factors: Absence of serious incidents \nand not having personal injuries is the main success factor. The general perception among residents is that \nBarcelona has a lot of trees, are general satisfied with the current canopy, but that in general they would \nlike more trees. Having a very compact city with a huge amount of cities is considered an asset both in the \nnews and among architects in Barcelona. Local politicians can see the value of the systematic assessments \nin managing risks and nuisances, which results in fewer hazards, fewer complaints compared to cities \nwithout similar assessment and monitoring. The long-term Barcelona Tree Master Plan 2017-2035 ensures \na continued focus on achieving the objectives with urban trees that is less dependent upon political shortterm cycles. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nName of case: Protective Mountain Forest Management, Switzerland \n \nCountry: Switzerland. \nContact person: Luuk Dorren (Bern University of Applied Science \u2013 BFH). \nClimate impacts: Rockfalls, landslides, avalanches. \n \nBrief about the case: Forests can provide effective protection against natural hazards typical occurring in \nmountains regions (i.e., rockfalls, landslides and avalanches). By preserving and actively managing the \nforest, this function can be maintained, and people are prevented from getting injured or killed, or \ninfrastructures (e.g., roads, buildings) being damaged. The Engadin case is an example of the many ongoing \nprojects of protection forest management in Switzerland. The use of NBS is part of the Swiss integrated \nrisk management (other elements are proper land-use planning (e.g., by use of hazards maps), and \norganization measures (e.g., early warning, evacuation, closing of the road). Technical measures (e.g., nets) \ncan also play a role. \n \nRole of climate change adaptation (CCA) / Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR): The main purpose of the \nprotection forest management is DRR, but CCA is continuously discussed in terms of how the management \nstrategy can be improved to be adaptive to climate change (e.g., re-calculation of mud/water reservoirs, \nselection of tree species). \n \nNBS measures implemented: protection forest management (PFM), which includes silvo-cultural \ninterventions (i.e., practice of controlling the growth, composition/structure, and quality of the forest to \nmeet certain values and needs). \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: technical/physical NBS impact assessment (baseline assessment \n(ex-ante), monitoring (ongoing)): assess state of the forests, defines targets and estimates impacts of \npotential interventions (e.g., removing trees, planting trees, placing nets), and related costs. Main \nmethods include effectiveness assessments (e.g., modelling (e.g., impact with and without NBS), remote \nsensing data (e.g., national hazard map), in-situ measurements (monitoring & example plots)) and \nindicator-based assessments (e.g., very detailed forest check/guidelines). Economic assessment (ex-ante): \nprimarily only done for technical measures, including cost-benefit analysis; benefit-cost ratio for NBS is \nknown to be adequate. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: planning and implementation of NBS; assessments are part of ongoing \nmaintenance and operations, post-disaster evaluation of NBS effectiveness; post-disaster assessment of \nneeds of NBS improvement or additional measures; the primary purpose is DRR but increasing attention \nto also account for additional benefits (wood production, biodiversity, recreation) and to integrate into \nassessment. \n \nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method): national guidelines, practicality (e.g., sample \nplots are selected to represent certain conditions, as not everything can be measured everywhere). \nUse of assessment outputs: support of daily forest management; communication to public; support to redefine regional and national strategies if needed. \n \nFunding and budget: PFM is financed by the region (Canton) and country with 160 million every year. For \neach project, including the actual intervention (i.e., keeping the forest in a healthy state to meet the \nobjectives of PFM) and monitoring and evaluation, 40% of the budget is from the country, 40% from the \nregion and 20% from the local community where the intervention is happening. The owner of the forest \ndoes not have to pay anything. On average, interventions are taking place every 15-20 years after a disaster \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nevent, and every 5 years monitoring. The monitoring is done by local forest managers, paid by the \ncommune, and controlled/checked by region/national agencies. \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: no stakeholder involvement, but when interventions are \ncloser to the city is recognized that there is a need for more communication towards citizens to enhance \nacceptance and raise awareness of SFM. \n \nBarriers/challenges & success factors: challenges: sometimes local forest manager does not apply \nnational guidelines and cut more trees than allowed (to sell the wood). Projects are controlled by \u2018sample \nchecks\u2019 (supervision region); budget (priority where highest risk reduction is needed); success: \ncollaboration, sharing experiences (e.g., regular meeting with representatives from every region (Canton) \nto share experiences and discuss current issues such as climate change and how to improve the forest \nmanagement), teaching and training, history/tradition (long tradition of forest management in Switzerland \nwhere already in the eighties a re-thinking of natural hazards management took place, from \u2018control of \nnature\u2019 towards optimization of natural forest functions), national guidelines and norms. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nName of case: Resilient Forests, Germany, Spain, Portugal https://www.resilientforest.eu/ \n \nCountry: Spain, Germany and Portugal. \nContact person: M\u00e1ria del Carmen Gonz\u00e1lez Sanchis (Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Department of \nHydraulic Egineering and Environment) \nClimate impacts: flood, drought, wildfire. \n \nBrief about the case: The RESILENT FOREST promotes sustainable forest management at the watershed \nscale to improve forests resilience to wildfires, water scarcity, environmental degradation and other \neffects induced by climate change while enhancing biomass production. The project works with different \ncase study sites, facing different climate change challenges. The main output of the project is a Decision \nSupport System (DSS) tool to introduce forest managers to the climate change adaptation process. The \nDSS tool allows forest managers to select their objectives and chose the optimum management approach \nto reach then. \n \nRole of climate change adaptation / disaster risk reduction: Both, CCA and DRR, are the main purposes \nof the project, as \u201cnowadays you cannot think about forest management without thinking about climate \nchange\u201d (M. Gonz\u00e1lez Sanchis). \n \nNBS measures implemented: Sustainable Forest Management (SFM). \n\n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: technical/physical NBS impact assessments (=DSS tool) which \nquantifies the ecosystem services (ES) provided by forests under different management schemes (exante). The tool is based on qualitative (workshops with stakeholders, interviews) and quantitative \nassessment methods (in-situ measurements (e.g., hydrology, soil measurements, monitoring), mechanistic \nmodelling). Modelling is a key method; it quantifies current ES and optimize ES provision based on multiple \ncriteria (multi-criteria modelling). Thereby the model makes use of spatial and temporal quantitative data \n(e.g., satellite data). The project plans to add an economic valuation (e.g., cost-benefits of forest \nmanagement options) to the tool in a later stage of the project. \nPurpose of NBS assessment: identifying and assessing adaptation option (by optimizing forest ES related \nto water, fire, resilience, carbon, energy, timber and biodiversity), planning and implementation of SFM; \nthere are also plans to expand the tool to account for monetarization of benefits, costs (operational), \npotential job creation. \n \n\nhttps://www.resilientforest.eu/\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method: knowledge/research background & motivation \nto apply research; demand/question from the field (forest managers ask researchers for help as they \nstruggled with (expensive) forest management, research brought in the idea of SFM). \n \nUse of assessment outputs. The main purpose of the project is to develop the DSS tool, to be used by \nforest managers; The tool creates GIS-based SF management map (e.g., how to manage, which ES provided \netc.) as a final output. The aim of the tool is to reinforce the need for SFM to face climate change among \nforest managers and (EU) policy makers; The tool is still in development, but already successfully applied \nin varies areas. Especially the quantification of forest ES (first Step in the tool; \u2018to see what is going on in \nthe selected forest site\u2019, and \u2018what is happening with climate change\u2019) seems to be a useful assessment \nmethod to forest managers to recognize the multiple ES (beside timber) and to develop a broader view on \nthe forest. A regional government in Spain generated a funding line based on the results of the \nquantification. \n \n\nFunding and budget: The project is co-funded \nby the European Union\u2019s LIFE programme \n(60%) and (private) partners (40%); Most \nmoney is assigned to the DSS tool and to apply \nit in different case studies. Before the project \nstarted, a budget plan was developed. There \nare plans to use the tool also after the project \nis finished, and to further adapt and expand \n(e.g., focus on other aspects of the landscape) \nthe tool. E.g., a new project evolved from the \nproject and new experimental plots are \ninstalled in a new area. \n \nPhoto: M. Gonz\u00e1lez Sanchis \n\n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: From the start of the project stakeholder involvement \n(through workshops, individual meetings) was key to the development of the DSS tool; stakeholders are \nfrom public administration (e.g., regional government, city hall) and private forest owners. No social \nvulnerability assessments. \n \nBarriers & success factors: Challenge: The COVID situation was/is a challenge to reach out to stakeholders \n(which are essential to develop the tool & to disseminate the work); Another challenge was the working \ntogether (e.g., understanding each other), especially in the beginning, due to different backgrounds (e.g., \nscientific, culture, science vs application, context; \u2018it produces some delay in the project\u2019); and the \nmodelling work (to represent reality within the technical possibilities); Success: the work with the \nstakeholders. It was not only a \u201cgreat learning experience\u201d among project member (e.g., had to learn how \nto deal with a wide spectrum of (unexpected) perspectives), but it also made the tool really useful and \napplicable to the field, stakeholders buy-in the results and get interested in SFM. This is underlined by the \ninterest in the tool by many different stakeholders, also from outside the project. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nName of case: Cloudburst Management Plan, Copenhagen \n \nCountry: Denmark. \nContact person: Jan Rasmussen (Teknik & Milj\u00f8 \u2013 Center for byd\u00e6kkende strategier, Klima og Byrum, \nCopenhagen Municipality). \nClimate impacts: Pluvial flooding, cloudburst. \n \nBrief about the case: After the devastating cloudburst event in 2011 that caused massive private and \npublic asset damages, the Municipality of Copenhagen developed a Cloudburst Management Plan in 2012 \nto combat the impacts of future cloudbursts. The Plan is an extension of the Copenhagen Climate \nAdaptation Plan from 2010 that identifies future climate risks, outlines the priorities and measures \nrecommended for climate adaptation including extreme rainfall. \nThe Cloudburst Management Plan forms a strategy that identifies the optimal level of risk from cloudbursts \nthat the city should adapt to and what measures would be the most cost-effective to achieve that. The \nPlan concludes that a service level at 1:100 year event is the most cost-efficient adaptation level. \nAs part of the Cloudburst Management Plan, the City carried out an overall socio-economic risk assessment \ncomparing traditional grey engineering solutions and NBS adaptation measures in reducing the economic \nloss of assets, loss of property values, working place losses and delays in traffic for a 1:100 year event. The \nanalysis did not include non-market benefits of NBS or avoided damages to cultural values, human lives \nand health. The assessment showed that continuing to focus on traditional sewage systems would result \nin a negative societal gain: despite capital investments, financial damages from flooding would remain high \nand not justify the high investment in implementing grey measures. The chosen combined solution \nconsists of separating rainwater from the sewer network and establish around 300 surface projects, NBS \nand hybrid NBS solutions, focusing on water retention and drainage. Implementation started in 2015 and \nis expected to be finalised by 2035. \nThe Municipality collaborates closely with neighbouring municipalities on addressing cloudburst and flood \nrisks i.a. the comprehensive climate adaptation plan for the stream of Harrestrup is one example of \nsuccessful collaboration across municipalities. \n \nRole of Adaptation / DRR: Main objectives are related to adaptation of climate change \u2013 securing the city \nagainst damages from cloudburst events at a 1:100 year level using NBS and hybrid NBS solutions. \nAdditional objectives include creating an attractive greener city with more recreational opportunities and \nmore biodiversity that also helps attract new citizens and investments to the city. \n \nNBS measures implemented: NBS measures implemented contribute to reduce flood peak reduction, \nincrease infiltration and water storage, reduce the load to the sewer system and reduce run-off. The NBS \nmeasures implemented improve the connectivity and functionality of green and blue infrastructures, \nincrease biodiversity through the increased quality and quantity of green and blue infrastructures. \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: Technical/physical impacts - The city is split up in 7 catchments \nand for each catchment a detailed risk assessment plan was made. Physical impacts are modelled ex ante \nusing detailed coupled-physics based models of hydrology (MIKE-SHE). Resolution is at a very fine scale \n(20x20cm), which allows for a detailed modelling of hydrology and avoids over-dimensioning surface \nsolutions and mis-investments. Models are analysed in spatial and temporal resolution, taking into account \nuncertainty. The technical and physical impacts are revised every 4 years to align with latest scenarios. \nEconomic impacts - Ex-ante social cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the whole of Copenhagen and \nFrederiksberg Municipality for the Cloudburst plan. Economic impacts include traffic delay, loss or damage \nof assets and cost of implementation. The assessment found that by combining traditional grey solutions \n(pipes) with surface solutions, the city would achieve a socio-economic net benefit of 5 billion DKK (670 \nMio. EUR), which is 9 billion DKK (1.2 billion EUR) more than if the Cloudburst Plan were to be realised with \nonly grey solutions. \nEconomic cost-effectiveness impacts of individual projects are made within each of the 7 catchments to \nassess the cost-effectiveness of different alternatives (grey versus NBS). A total of 300 projects in \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nCopenhagen Municipality has been identified, which will be carried out over a period of 20 years (ending \nby 2035). \nAlso, an analysis was made to estimate the costs of the Cloudburst plan for households, who pays for the \nimplementation through the utility bills. Findings show an initial annual cost of 1000kr per year per \nhousehold, and decreasing over time. \nEnvironmental impacts - Environmental impact assessments during the operation phase of the surface \nsolutions are underway as a pilot, especially in relation to impacts of NBS and other surface solutions on \nwater quality under the WFD. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: \u201cAssessing adaptation options\u201d was the main entry Step of the socioeconomic assessment in the adaptation cycle. The Climate Adaptation Plan had already identified the \nadaptation options. The Cloudburst Management Plan assessed the socio-economic performance of the \ndifferent adaptation options at city level, and detailed risk assessment plans including cost-effectiveness \nanalysis are carried out at catchment level within the city.  \u201cMonitoring and evaluation\u201d constitutes the \nsecond entry Step of relevance in the adaptation cycle. Main entry Steps of the assessment in the DRM \ncycle are: (i) planning and implementation of NBS and (ii) assessments as part of ongoing maintenance and \noperations. \nBesides CCA and DRR, the assessment included following additional purposes: i) water management; and \nii) green space management. In relation to biodiversity, the municipality is currently considering applying \nfor fund to monitor biodiversity improvements in areas where de-pavement or rewilding have already \nbeen implemented. \n \nFollowing aspects were considered as secondary/indirect purposes of the assessment: \n\u2022 Place regeneration: The implementation of the Cloudburst Management Plan is integrated with wider \n\nregeneration planning and funding of neighbourhoods in need of improvements. \n\u2022 Knowledge and social capacity building for sustainable urban transformation: Citizen groups in the \n\nneighbourhoods are invited for hearing phases and providing input to how to design the NBS for \nadditional benefits of residents. \n\n\u2022 Social justice and social cohesion: Several of the NBS projects are integrated with city renewal plans \n(Omr\u00e5del\u00f8ft K\u00f8benhavns Kommune) and prove to be a success in generating local ownership. One \nexample include \u2018Sydhavnen\u2019 (South Harbour neighbourhood) where the implementation of seven \nbasins for retaining stormwater was combined with different types of lower-lying gardens and play \ngrounds, developed in co-creation with citizen groups in the design and implementation phase. The \nprocess resulting in a strong sense of ownership, where concerns for garbage filling up the basins didn\u2019t \nmanifest as the residents take real care of the area; and \n\n\u2022 New economic opportunities and green jobs: Copenhagen Municipality also aims for export of new \nmethods and experiences to be part of the Cloudburst Plan. Several international collaborations are in \nplace with cities such as New York, Buenos Aires and Beijing, where Copenhagen provides planning and \nconsultancy services. Also, many delegations have visited Copenhagen since 2012 to learn from \nexperiences of implementation of NBS. \n\n \nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method): The focus in the Cloudburst Plan of including \nNBS and surface solutions was to generate added value, no-regrets and synergies with other urban \nagendas in Copenhagen. NBS for CCA/DRR support the long-time aim of increasing green and recreative \nopportunities in the city. As the cloudburst solutions are not in use very often, it was important for the city \nto design solutions that provide added values. In fact, Copenhagen strive to create solutions where it\u2019s not \nvisually obvious that the implemented solutions are cloudburst solutions. Examples of this can be found \nin Skt Annae square and Skt. Kjelds neighbourhood. \nThe development of the initial assessments after the extreme cloudburst event in 2011 were characterized \nwith very little time to develop the plan. In order to address the inherent uncertainties in such plans, the \ncity carries out cost-effectiveness assessments at 62 smaller catchments to make sure the plans are \nfeasible, cost-effective and optimal. This requires very detailed and robust data of the city. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nThe detailed plans and analyses allows the city to avoid mis-investment and ensure optimal protection. \nThe municipality estimate spending about 2.6 mio. EUR on developing the Cloudburst Plan and detailed \nanalyses, compared to the total investment of implementing the plan of up to 1.6 bio. EUR. \n \nUse of assessment outputs: The Cloudburst Plan aimed at establishing the most cost-effective way to \naddress future cloud bursts and what should be the optimal service level and to provide the basis for \ndecision-making on CCA/DRR. The methodology developed and applied 2011-2015 has fed into the recent \nregulation on socio-economic assessments of adaptation and other municipalities have been inspired to \ncarrying out similar analyses. \nThe plan concludes that a service level at 1:100 year event is the most cost-efficient. Three levels of \nassessments are in place: i) a socio-economic assessment at city-level and ii) cost effectiveness analysis of \nprojects to handle cloudbursts and rain water for 7 catchments (Konkretiseringsplaner); iii) detailed cost \neffectiveness analysis on small catchment level (62 sub-catchments) in order to ensure up-to-date \ncalculations at a more precise level. \ni)  At city level, the Municipality estimated the socio-economic costs and benefits of the Cloudburst Plan. \n\nThe analysis was purely an economic risk analysis that includes loss of assets, loss of property values, \nworking place losses, and delays in traffic. The analysis for instance did not include the avoided \ndamages to cultural values, human lives and health or other multiple benefits from surface solutions \ncompared to grey solutions. The square meter value of property in the municipality does not differ \nsignificantly across the municipality, which is why the Cloudburst Plan concluded the most optimal level \nof protection would be an equal level of protection for all. \n\nii)  A detailed cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out for 7 catchment areas. For each of the identified \nprojects within the 7 catchment areas, the Municipality calculated what would be the concrete costs \nfor ensuring the agreed-upon service level and the operational costs, comparing traditional, grey \nsolutions with NBS. \n\niii)  The detailed cost-effectiveness analysis for the 7 catchment areas are supplemented and revised with \nlocal estimations of cost-effectiveness in 62 catchments shortly before actual implementation. \n\nThe Cloudburst Plan assessment also aimed to enhance collaboration across neighbouring municipalities, \nwhich is of utmost importance. Harrestrup \u00c5 is one example of successful collaboration across \nmunicipalities. Here, a comprehensive plan has been made w.r.t. climate adaptation. \n \nFunding and budget: The Municipality funded the socio-economic assessment, the Cloudburst \nManagement Plan and subsequent concretization of measures at neighbourhood level at its own initiative \nand before any requirements or national guidance was in place. \nThe assessment was budgeted and negotiated in a Step-by-Step approach. First, the administration asked \nfor funds to develop the CCA plan. Then funds were released to develop the strategic cloudburst plan that \ndeals with handling cloudbursts and rainwater. Following this, the administration was granted funds to \nmake the detailed plan at neighbourhood level (7 catchment areas). \nAt implementation level, total investments are estimated to be between 1.6 and 1.8 billion euros (2011 \nprices). Currently, about 20-30% of the plan is implemented. The water utility company is responsible for \nfunding the hydraulic part of the solutions (ca. 92% of investment costs), while the municipality funds the \n\u2018green\u2019 part of the solutions (ca. 8% of the budget). The water utility company covers the costs via the \nutility bills. \nOperational costs of the surface NBS and hybrid NBS solutions are still unknown and need to be based on \nexperience, especially understanding how to split operational costs for managing traditional green \ninfrastructure and operational costs of securing that the CCA part of the green infrastructure functions \noptimally. \nLong-term assessments of the effectiveness of the NBS and hybrid solutions is underway. Physical \nmonitoring is needed to better understand how best to operate the solutions. With more than 300 projects \nacross the city, once the implementation is complete, the city cannot regularly check manually on each \nlocation. Pilot projects are therefore in place to test how best to measure whether the solutions hold \nwater, understand level of water flow, how the ground water level develops, and the quality of the surface \nwater being led to the water courses and the sea. This will be expanded to all 300 projects to allow for \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nonline monitoring and long-term impact assessment of these solutions. Although the solutions are \ndesigned to withstand a 1:100 year event and the full scale of the solutions will occur only rarely, the \nsolutions are designed to also handle everyday rain. In addition to understanding the effectiveness of the \nsolutions, the Municipality also needs to document that the quality of surface water handled in the surface \nsolutions does not reduce water quality in streams, lakes and the sea under the EU Water Quality \nFramework Directive. \n \nProvisions/structures in place for carrying out long-term assessments: Currently, the Municipality is \nrunning a pilot project to monitor the physical effectiveness of the solutions to mainstream maintenance \nof the 300 projects. The pilot tests different types of monitoring and documentation of water flows and \nthe long-term effectiveness of the solutions. The monitoring needs to document the effectiveness of both \neveryday rain and the extreme, and more seldom, events like cloudbursts. The pilot also addresses the \nneed to monitor water quality flowing from surface solutions and NBS to waterways and the sea. \nThe municipality is also considering monitoring of biodiversity on implemented NBS involving depavement and rewilding. \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: Stakeholder involvement - Stakeholders in terms of citizens \nand organisations have been involved in the hearing phase of the Cloudburst plan and local residents are \nsystematically involved in co-creation and co-design processes at neighbourhood level in the \nimplementation phase of NBS and surface solutions. \nSocial vulnerability - The socio-economic assessment does not address aspects of social vulnerability. The \ndata is based on insurance losses per square meter, which is relatively homogenous across the \nmunicipality. However, there are differences in impacts of losses relative to income. This would be good \nto incorporate, especially in areas that are not very homogenous. \n \nBarriers & success factors for the NBS assessments: Barriers - Water Framework Directive - A challenging \naspect of implementing NBS at systemic scale to handle everyday rain and cloudbursts across a large city \nis ensuring that water quality respects the Water Framework Directive. The current legislative set up is \nsuch that if the city were to not implement adaptation options, they would not be liable to ensure water \nquality from an extreme rain event, but when NBS and other surface solutions are implemented to \npercolate and lead rain water directly to the sea, the municipality is required to ensure high water quality. \nThe challenge is finding the best approach to ensure quarter quality in accordance with the WFD, while \naccepting that smart solutions to filter and ensure water quality from NBS in CCA/DDR can only be \ndeveloped over time. The Cloudburst Plan was explicitly prepared without having all solutions developed. \nA lot of future solutions are dependent on business developments. \n \nRegulation introduced retroactively - New legislation has been introduced in Denmark from January 2021, \nrequiring municipalities to carry out socio-economic analysis for handling climate impacts. The legislation \nrequires that socio-economic analyses are made for individual catchment areas and not at city level, \ndespite the legal requirement to ensure an equal level of protection across a municipality. Although this \npushes municipalities who have not yet started socio-economic assessments of adaptation plans, the \nregulation places Copenhagen Municipality in a difficult position. The law is implemented retroactively, \nmeaning the municipality can be forced to conduct new socio-economic analyses at catchment level \nbefore being allowed to continue implementing adaptation measures. Such analyses could potentially lead \nto different service levels, outdating the implementation that started in 2015 and risking delays to the \nremainder part of the investment plan. Investments of billion euros are at stake at the moment. \n \nIdentifying operational costs - separating operational costs of NBS for CCA/DRR compared to NBS for \nrecreational purposes is non-trivial, as NBS are multi-functional, but departments of municipalities are \nresponsible for the different purposes of the NBS have separate budgets. \nRainwater separation and lack of solidarity - Rainwater separation on individual household plots is today \nrequired to be privately paid when the municipality decides to separate rainwater from the sewage \nsystem. This can be a cost of between 20.000-40.000kr per household (EUR 2.700 - 5.400) and can cause \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nvery high levels of conflicts. This should be carried in solidarity rather than on the shoulders of individual \nhousehold owners. \n \nLimitations to elements included in assessment - Assumptions in the socio-economic analysis have \nlimitations, by not including the non-market values of NBS including the value of increasing urban green \nareas, improve biodiversity and recreation opportunities, despite these being aspects demanded by \ncitizens and politicians. The reason why this was not included in the Cloudburst plan was to avoid potential \ncriticism of difficult to assess values. Also, these values are not included in guidance of socio-economic \nassessments of public investments made by the Ministry of Finance. The Municipality would prefer to \ninclude these values to obtain a more correct assessment. \n \nSuccess factors - Insurance value - The implementation of the cloudburst plan on neighbourhood level \nprotects households against a 1:100 extreme rain event. This collective investment, paid by residents via \nthe utility bills and municipal taxes represents an insurance value that could be used to decrease individual \ninsurance costs of households, or at a more generic level to avoid an increase in the re-insurance costs for \ninsurance companies. This can also stabilize property values and improve opportunities for investing in \nCopenhagen. This is going to be a competition factor. \nData availability - Another element considered a success factor was sufficient data available for conducting \nthe socio-economic and cost-effectiveness analyses. Also, the municipality could prove that the flood \nevents they had analysed could material, qua the extreme event in 2011. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nName of case: Tullstorps\u00e5n, Sweden \n \nCountry: Sweden. \nContact person: Christoffer Bonthron (Tullstorps\u00e5n Ekonomisk F\u00f6rening). \nClimate impacts: Drought, flooding. \n \n\nBrief about the case: In recent \nyears, Swedish agriculture has \nexperienced extreme wet and dry \nseasons. To counter the problems \nof drought and associated crop \nlosses, the Tullstorps\u00e5n 2.0 \nproject aims to store water in \nmultifunctional wetlands when \nthere is excess water and to \n'harvest' it from storage and use it \nin a recirculating irrigation \nsystem.  \n \nPhoto: Kartor.eniro.se & \nTulltorps\u00e5n Ekonomisk F\u00f6rening  \n\n \nThe Tullstorps\u00e5n is a 30 km long stream where landowners, organised as the Tullstorps\u00e5n Economic \nAssociation, have worked since 2009 to restore the watercourse in a holistic way to improve biodiversity \nand water quality (Tullstorps\u00e5n 1.0). Between 2009 and 2019, 39 wetlands covering 169 ha and 10 km of \nthe stream were restored. Another 3-4 years of restoration work are left in this first-generation project. \nTulltorps\u00e5n is the single largest project in Sweden encompassing a total of 100 local projects in a single \narea. \nHaving experienced severe dry and wet conditions in recent years, landowners in the Tullstorps\u00e5n 1.0 \nproject expanded the collaboration towards climate proofing local agriculture using NBS. This is carried \nout in Tullstorps\u00e5n 2.0, operating from 2019 to 2025. Even if the main purpose of Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0 was to \nimprove water quality and biodiversity, the NBS measures in place have also proven to have a significant \nimpact on reducing flood risks on agricultural land. \n \nRole of Adaptation / DRR: Main objectives of Tulltorps\u00e5n 2.0 are related to adaptation of climate change \n\u2013 securing agriculture against drought in spring summer and against flooding in winter months. Additional \nobjectives include improving water quality and biodiversity. \n \nNBS measures implemented: During Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0, NBS measures put in place include river meandering \nand wetland restoration/construction at large-scale. Today, 50 wetlands and 25 km river have been \nrestored. The project is the single largest NBS project in Sweden receiving the most funding to date. The \ncatchment measures 6,300 km2. The construction of wetlands and 2 stage ditches has reduced the average \npeak flow from 12m3/sec in 2009 to less than 5m3/sec during 2019 and 2020. Where flooding of fields was \nnormal around bottle necks on the river (e.g., bridges), this has now not happened at all during the past \ntwo winters. Also, the sediment arriving in the 2-stage ditches is recuperated and placed on low areas on \nfields, also there improving on the farmability of the land and reducing risk of water amassing. Because of \nthe two-stage ditches, the outlets of the drainage are now not in the river, which before has frequently let \nto backloading of water to the fields, this has now stopped. \n \nThree NBS measures are planned implemented in Tulltorps\u00e5n 2.0: i) Multifunctional wetland \u2013 using \nexisting ponds to store water from the Tulltorps\u00e5n in autumn/winter months for use in spring and summer, \nwhere dry spells and droughts occur more and more. The added value is that N and P, high in winter \nmonths, is pumped to the ponds and recirculated in summer; ii) Recirculated irrigation from the ponds \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nunder a) to agricultural fields. Traditional crops start suffering from lack of water in the growing season. \nAlso irrigation would allow for expanding the area suitable for vegetable farming \u2013 a priority in Sweden to \nincrease the level of self-sufficiency. Plans are to irrigate half of the farms\u2019 1000ha; and iii) Customised \ndrainage system enabling the soil to take both natural rain and recirculated irrigation at the same time \n(Assessments: detailed pre-study). \nAlthough the 3 NBS measures can exist individually, the combination of the three is expected to provide \nthe optimal pay off for the environment and agricultural production. \nToday, traditional crops (e.g., sugar beets) are grown on the 1000ha, and they require irrigation to grow \noptimally. The long-term idea is to begin production of vegetables to supplement the overused agricultural \nland used for vegetable production, also contributing towards Sweden\u2019s self-sufficiency of vegetables. \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: \nTechnical/physical impacts - Customised drainage system: a pre-study of technical feasibility and \neffectiveness has been carried out on the customised drainage system in collaboration with the Swedish \nAgricultural University (SLU) and a consultancy, both specialists in drainage. The funder (NEFCO) requires \na two-Step approach starting with the pre-study before deciding to move further on to the detailed \ntechnical study and implementation. \nRecirculated Irrigation: pre-study is underway, identifying the most appropriate irrigation techniques. \nMultifunctional wetlands: Idea design is complete. Next Step is to make a technical feasibility assessment \nand to start implementation. This is quite easy as old infrastructure is already in place. The water ponds \nare in green field development extremely costly infrastructure (capacity of 100,000 - 200,000 m3 water), \nthat is already in place, lowering costs significantly. \nEconomic impacts - Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0 carried out an ecosystem service assessment in 2017. 7 different \nservices out of 15 were monetarily evaluated: biodiversity, water regulation, nutrient retention, \nrecreation, and tourism. Results of the Cost Benefit Analysis indicate that implementation costs totalled \n6.4 million EUR while societal benefits amount to 24.5 million EUR, indicating a clear societal gain of the \nproject. Monetary assessment methods included alternative costs, reduced damage costs on housing and \nyield, willingness to pay for recreational fishing, spatially dependent unit recreation values and tourism \nexpenditures. \nTulltorps\u00e5n 2.0 aims to assess the impacts of the combined projects in terms of increased yield assessment \nand economic impact of the measures along with the potential for crop diversification towards vegetable \nfarming. \nEnvironmental impacts - Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0 assesses nitrogen, phosphorous contents and biodiversity impacts \nof NBS measures ex post as well as water flow at the river mouth. \nAn ecosystem services assessment was carried out in 2017, assessing 15 different regulating, provisioning \nand cultural ecosystem services. \nTulltorps\u00e5n 2.0 will assess NBS effectiveness to control drought and flood. \nOther assessments - Assessments to investigate the success of the Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0 include: i) an evaluation \nof why the renaturing of the Tulltorps\u00e5n and another four large-scale projects have proven successful. This \nwas an evaluation carried out by the National Sea and Water Agency; ii) a method description and \nevaluation, investigated by Lund University, investigating the success factors regarding the methods; iii) a \nfourth major evaluation report is underway to evaluate the success factors and lessons learned of the \nwhole project. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: Recirculated irrigation: \u201cIdentifying adaptation options\u201d was the main entry \nStep of the technical assessment in the adaptation cycle. Multipurpose wetland and customized drainage: \n\u201cMonitoring and evaluation\u201d was the main entry Step of the technical assessment in the adaptation cycle. \nBesides CCA, the assessments included following additional purposes: i) water management; and ii) \nbiodiversity enhancement. Following aspects were considered as secondary/indirect purposes of the \nassessment: the multifunctional wetland could become a large area for recreation, bird watchers and \nhunting. Access is already ensured to the ponds with bird watchers already there. The project includes \nplanting trees both for birds and creating shadow to decrease evapotranspiration of the pond. \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method): The assessment methods applied in Tulltorps\u00e5n \n1.0 and 2.0 vary, but common for them is a desire to understand the feasibility and effectiveness of the \nNBS measures for project partners. Also external funding bodies have either requested assessments or \nundertaken comparative assessments of the Tulltorps\u00e5n compare to other national large-scale projects to \nbetter understand success factors and lessons learned. \n \nUse of assessment outputs: There are 3 major evaluation reports and a number of smaller evaluations \nand investigations: i) The ecosystem service report was interesting for the farmers to see the CBA situation \nand also for funders to assess whether the project funding is well spent; ii) the report from the National \nSea and Water Agency was to understand success factors of large-scale projects; and iii) the method report \nwas based on own interest to review methods of why the project is successful and what obstacles have \noccurred over time. \nThe 4th major report will be a total evaluation of Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0 on success factors and lessons learned, \nhighlights for municipality and for the region and the country why this was so successful and what could \nbe done for the stakeholders. This report is a requirement from the county board with funding made \navailable for the evaluation of the project, The evaluation will be conducted by external universities. \nThe type of output and methods applied are a result of the funder requirements, farmer community and \nwider stakeholders involved in the project. For instance, farmers are very interested in quantitative \nmeasures of effectiveness and impacts (e.g., total N and P, the cost-benefit analysis). As choice of method \nis such an important part of the project, it was also decided to evaluate specifically the different methods \nand the constraints involved, in addition to assessment of effectiveness. The project was not limited by \nmeans or funding to conduct the assessments. They have made adjustment of approaches to save on costs, \nbut not on ambition of evaluation, e.g., by stop paying a consultancy company to carry out weekly water \nsampling, they trained a local farmer to do the same activity (who has done this for 7 years now). \nThe output has been used for internal reasons and to disseminate the project in Sweden. \n \nFunding and budget: Funding for the multifunctional wetland and recirculated irrigation is part of \nautonomous adaptation efforts of one individual farmer, interested in adapting to drought and flood risks \nin the future. \nThe multifunctional wetland is based on the existing of natural and artificial water ponds that would be \nrecovered to store water in large scale. As then new Rural Development Programme from 2023 can \nprovide potential funding for water magazines and specialised drainage systems, the project hopes to \nobtain funding for the multifunctional wetland NBS. At the moment, the project takes one pond per year. \nThe adjustable drainage system NBS has received funding from NEFCO and WWF. \n \nProvisions/structures in place for carrying out long-term assessments: Customised drainage: part of the \npre-study is to describe what kind of evaluation and assessment system will be built in parallel with the \nimplementation of the drainage system. This will be carried out by SLU. \nRecirculated irrigation and multi-functional wetlands: no long-term assessments have been decided upon \nyet, but the project partners are in discussions on securing funding to enable SLU to undertake \nassessments on several strands, e.g., how much P and N can you take from the river to the ponds and \nfields and what are the impacts on agricultural productivity from recirculated irrigation compared to no \nirrigation. \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: The economic association consists of 90 farmers and also \npeople living in the villages close to the river, a total of 500 people are members. A lot of the people enjoy \nthe recreational opportunities of the project. \nAnnual major meetings take place for all along with different events, social media, newsletters and \nwebsite. \nDaily challenge to combine different interests. Ambition to provide a hiking path along the entire river \nfrom the sea over the 30 km. The problem with some land owners is that they don\u2019t want people on the \nfields with horses. Others are interested in hunting, and don\u2019t want people to come in and out of the area. \nNot reached ambition. As a consequence, the pathway is broken up and implemented where possible. \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nIn the beginning activities were funded 100% by external funding, later on, only 75% were external project \nfunding, but the association was able to cover the remaining 25% with funding from the rural development \nprogramme, having several projects running simultaneous to cover the needed funding. \nIn the beginning, not all were positive of the project, but now seeing the effect on flood protection, \nbiodiversity and water quality. Several farmers where no physical actions done, and now they want it on \ntheir land, but unfortunately Tolltursps\u00e5n 1.0 is closing down. Last wetland is being made now. \nWhen the Tulltorps\u00e5n 2.0 idea was proposed to the farmers in the association in 2019, with the 2018 \ndrought event in fresh memory, all farmers wanted to have the measures implemented on their property. \n \nBarriers & success factors for the NBS assessments: \nBarriers -The largest barrier is the economy, although the project obtained all the funding it needed.  \nThe amount of efforts to obtain funding and to report on activities costs a lot of time and effort. Convincing \nfarmers of the idea of NBS to leave a part of their land for wetland and remeandering of the river was not \neasy in the beginning, but as farmers could see the impacts of the projects, they are all interested in having \nNBS implemented on their land. The lessons from the project can help farmers in other areas and projects \nto replicate the way of involving farmers and obtaining accept. \nFarmers need a long-term perspective in a project, which requires dedicated project manager and \naccountant in the association. \nIn the beginning, the project did not get the support from the municipality. The funding system was not \nopen for the economic association. Some people on the county administrative board found it so successful \nand interesting that they opened the programme for economic association to apply for funding. \nSuccess factors - The project started with a few farmers who started to discuss how to improve water \nquality and over time organized themselves in the economic association that to day covers the entire \ncatchment. The project is managed locally by a professional project manager and they have managed to \nget all land owners along the river to opt in the project (Tulltorps\u00e5n 1.0) and all farmers were interested \nin partaking in Tulltorps\u00e5n 2.0). \nThe project has worked systematically with documenting and quantifying impacts of NBS and also on \ninvestigating methods for assessing NBS. The evidence serves internally to inform farmers and consolidate \nthe emerging understanding of what NBS can do and externally to inspire and inform other projects and \nregional authorities. \nFarmers do not want to invest money and they don\u2019t want to get involved in paper work. A dedicated \nproject manager was therefore engaged to take care of external funding, contacts and reporting. Also, \nfarmers need long-term perspectives in a project, hence projects that run over longer time periods with a \nseamless project management in place. \nThe response from nature has been very fast, which has helped convince farmers of the win-win \npossibilities. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nCase name: Camargue Saltworks Restoration, France \n \nCountry: France. \nContact person: Brigitte Poulin (Tour du Valat Research Institute) \nClimate impacts: Coastal erosion, coastal flooding, sea level rise. \n \nBrief about the case: A large restoration project started in 2011 in the former saltworks of Salin-de Giraud, \nlocated in the southeast of the Rh\u00f4ne delta, within the Camargue Regional Natural Park and the UNESCO\u2018s \nMan and Biosphere Reserve. This site represents a vast coastal area of 6,500 ha, partially transformed and \nused for industrial salt production from 1950 to 2008. It was characterised by a strong artificialisation, with \nseafront dykes and disconnection among different water bodies used as ponds for salt extraction. After \nthe acquisition of the area by the French Coastal Authority (Conservatoire du Littoral; in 2008-2012), a \nfundamental shift in the vocation of the site from salt production to wetland restoration guided the new \nmanagement strategy, turning the former saltworks into a buffer zone to mitigate impacts of storms and \nsea level rise. The main purpose of the project was to restore the natural hydrology, in particular by \nallowing natural water exchanges among the lagoons part of the wetland and between the wetland and \nthe neighbouring hydro-systems (Rh\u00f4ne River, Vaccar\u00e8s lagoon and Sea). The decision not to rebuild a \ncollapsing sea-front dike gave an opportunity to restore the coastal dynamics in areas submitted to high \nerosion. Another dike built in 1859 to protect people and property, located further inland, will be adapted \nto ensure proper flooding protection in the Rh\u00f4ne delta. \nPositive effects have been already detected, from an environmental, social and economic point of view. A \nprotecting natural sandbar is building up behind the collapsed dike. Restoration works have also created \na new space for recreational activities and provided opportunity for knowledge development in the field \nof coastal dynamics and management. \n \nRole of Adaptation / DRR: Main objectives are related to the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems and \nrelated services, including in particular habitat and biodiversity conservation. Climate change adaptation \nand DRR are however important components of the restoration project. The restoration of coastal \necosystems and dynamics contributes to providing a buffer zone to better cope with coastal erosion, \ncoastal flooding and sea level rise. The maintenance and strengthening of the inner dike has important \nDRR implications, aiming to protect goods and people from flooding. \n \nNBS measures implemented: Restoration of coastal habitats. \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: The assessment covered the following main NBS impacts. \nTechnical/physical impacts - The assessment focused on hydrological aspects and ground elevation (DTM \n\u2013 Digital Terrain Model through Lidar data), also to evaluate alternative interventions and different SLR \nscenarios. These aspects have been considered during all the phases (ex-ante, operational, and ex-post). \n \nTechnical feasibility and effectiveness assessment was based on in-situ measurement (e.g., coastline \nlocation, water level, etc.), remote sensing (e.g., evolution of the coastline, sand bar formation), and \nhydrological modelling to define pathways for natural water flow and needed hydraulics measures as well \nas evolution of water level and salinity depending upon different management and SLR scenarios. The \nresult of this assessment showed that there is a very variable coastal dynamic in the area; there are places \nexperiencing erosion and others where accretion prevails. According to monitoring, the whole net balance \nis positive with an increase of habitats (about 9 ha). \nEconomic impacts - Economic aspects were only partially assessed, mainly focusing on the implication of \nthe possible reconstruction of the seafront dike. Economic aspects have been in particular considered \nduring the ex-ante (qualitatively) and operational (quantitatively) phases. \nCosts for re-building the 9 km seafront dike (which collapsed) with reinforcing groynes (13-17 million Euros \nfor the seafront dike + 7-24 million Euros for the groynes + 800,000 \u20ac/year for maintenance) were \ncompared with cost for reinforcing the 16 km inner protection (7-13 million Euros + 80,000 \u2013 140,000 \n\u20ac/year for maintenance). \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nHowever, a proper evaluation of NBS impacts on economic activities was not performed. Besides cost \nevaluation and comparison, the decision to not rebuild the seafront dike was mainly based on a qualitative \ncoast-effectiveness assessment, which also considered the potential value of the restored wetland \necosystem. From a pure economic perspective, it must be considered that salt production provided jobs \nand revenues for local communities, which were greater than those provided by current economic \nactivities. The French Littoral Conservatory and the other co-managers of the area aim to support \nsustainable economic activities (e.g., sustainable tourism, recreational activities, traditional fisheries, \ntraditional waterfowl hunting, electric bike rental, etc.) also to improve socio-economic benefits for the \nlocal population. Qualitative evaluation of the effects of the renatulisation project on some specific \nactivities was performed: e.g., these have been considered very good on local, traditional fisheries, while \nseveral conflicts shall be solved with hunters. \nEnvironmental impacts - Environmental impacts have been considered during all the phases (ex-ante, \noperational, and ex-post), focusing on monitoring the changes in water flow, water level, salinity, saltmarshes accretion and extension, and distribution of aquatic plants, benthic macroinvertebrates, fish of \nthe lagoons and water birds. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: \u201cIdentifying adaptation options\u201d has been considered the main entry Step of \nthe assessment in the adaptation cycle, in particular to support the decision to maintain and restore or \nnot the collapsed seafront dike. \u201cMonitoring and evaluation\u201d constitutes the second entry Step for \nrelevance. DRR implications are specifically related to the inner protection dike; main entry Steps of the \nassessment in the DRM cycle are: (i) planning and implementation of NBS; and (ii) assessments as part of \nongoing maintenance and operations. \nBesides CCA and DRR, the assessment included following additional purposes: (i) water management, (ii) \ngreen space management; specifically \u201cblue\u201d space management (rehabilitation and management of \naquatic habitats, such as salt marshes and mud flats); (iii) biodiversity enhancement. Following aspects \nwere considered as secondary/indirect purposes of the assessment: \n\u2022 Wellbeing; the site is freely open to any people (it is very famous in the Camargue for providing large, \n\nopen and free natural space). There are several recreational uses of the beach, like kite surfing, bathing, \nand other coastal and marine sports. Uses have been mapped and plans defined for specific activities. \n\n\u2022 New economic opportunities and green jobs; a diagnostic study on current socio-economic activities \nand future potentiality is available, focusing on small activities providing some income to local \ncommunities (traditional fisheries, sustainable tourism, recreational activities). \n\n \nDrivers of assessment - reason for choosing the method: Major drivers for the assessment were \nconsidered: relevance for the overall project objectives, expectations from funding bodies (assessment \nwas required by some of the used funding mechanisms), data and knowledge availability, availability of \nskills and technical competences. No major constraints have been encountered. Initially, not all expertise \nwas internally available; however missing skills were found promptly. \n \nUse of assessment outputs: The site is located within a regional natural park. The French Coastal \nConservancy designated three co-managers of the coastal area: the Regional nature park, the National \nSociety for the Protection of Nature, and the Tour de Valat Research Institute. The most important \nelements the assessment aim to support are: \n\u2022 The free evolution of the coastline, involving coastal retreat with the natural formation of a sand bar \n\nbehind the dike, and use of coastal wetlands behind the sandbar to serve as buffer zone against sea \nstorms effects (erosion and flooding). \n\n\u2022 The restoration of natural water flows between the land and the sea across lagoons to provide nursery \nareas for marine fish and habitats to migratory fish and birds. \n\nMain assessment output include: annual reports, targeted recommendations, data, models (e.g., about \ncoastal and hydraulic processes), videos and newsletters. The site managers are currently working on a \ndedicated web-site, which will also include assessment results. Communication through social media is \nquite controversial. It is considered relevant, but also very time consuming and risky (e.g., due to \u201cfake \nnews\u201d). Some of the outputs (e.g., annual reports) provide essential information for pursuing adaptive \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nmanagement/restoration of the site according to the management plan framework. Some others (e.g., \nvideos) are more targeted to the general public, aiming to raise awareness. \nAssessment results have been used for adaptive management during and after the project \nimplementation. Gathered results feed the on-going updating of the management plan of the site. \nMoreover, the gathered experience in the implementation and assessment phases can be shared and \ncapitalized in other similar areas (coastal wetlands), e.g., through videos, workshops, scientific congresses, \nbrochures, fact sheets. \n \nFunding and budget: The restoration project has benefitted from public funds at EU (Life+, Interreg  \nMediterranean), national (Water Agency, Ministry of Ecology), and subnational levels (R\u00e9gion Sud, \nD\u00e9partement Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne), as well as from private funds (WWF, Total Foundation, Coca-Cola \nFoundation, MAVA Foundation). \nIn 2013 a management plan was developed for the restored and protected area: the plan is currently under \nrevision (it is expected to be reviewed every ten years). The plan sets several objectives and for each \nobjective it defines implementing actions (surveys, hydraulic works, etc.) with associated costs. The plan \nalso foresees assessment/monitoring activities and related costs for each of the objectives. When the first \nplan was developed, data and knowledge was not available for all aspects; this improved during the \nimplementation phase, thus contributing to the plan refinement also as far as assessment is concerned. \nThe management plan responds to five main orientations: (1) Restore a more natural hydrological \nfunctioning of the wetland ecosystem, by connecting the site to the neighbouring hydro-systems (Rh\u00f4ne \nRiver, Vaccar\u00e8s lagoon and Sea); (2) Restore the natural ecosystems characteristic of coastal lagoons and \nsandy coastlines, including dunes, salt Steppes and saltmarshes; (3) Maintain or increase the carrying \ncapacity for breeding colonial waterbirds; (4) Implement adaptive management to sea-level rise, including \ncontrolled coastal retreat in areas affected by erosion; (5) Contribute to sustainable development, \nincluding green tourism and recreational activities. \nLong-term monitoring/assessments are implemented by the owner (the French Coastal Conservatory) and \nco-managers of the site, as part of the management plan and according to an adaptive approach. The latter \nimplies that they manage the site adaptively through continuous learning derived from monitored data. \nThe assessment is defined in the management plan; part of the funds is secured, while another part needs \nto be funded through project proposals. A steering committee has been put in place for the management \nplan; it includes officials, scientists and other experts. The committee is regularly informed about the \nprogress in the design and implementation of the management plan, including the assessment \ncomponents (monitoring and survey). \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: Stakeholders have been partially involved. The project \nplanning and design was made by the French Coastal Conservancy and the representatives of the three \nco-managing bodies (Regional nature park, National Society for the Protection of Nature, and Tour du \nValat) with limited consultation of elected officials and the local population. The French Coastal \nConservancy and the site co-managers are working to significantly improve stakeholder engagement. The \nnew management plan includes several engaging activities to understand people's perception on the \nperformed re-naturalisation works, address remaining critical issues (e.g., related to human uses of the \narea) and improve communication. In 2020, a survey about how communication and people engagement \ncan be improved was conducted. \nIn past years, stakeholder involvement was mainly based on sharing of data and available diagnostic \nstudies on hydrology, flora, fauna, and socio-economic potentialities. Traditional users (e.g., fishermen \nand hunters) were invited to share their knowledge on the site. \n \nBarriers & success factors: During the implementation phase, unexpected incomprehension from the local \npopulation was encountered (apart from that linked to loss of economic activities related to salt \nproduction, which was expected). Unexpected opposition was due to the perception that the \nrehabilitation project negatively transformed the ecosystem and its landscape, in particular increasing the \nrisks of sea submersion (i.e. in winter) and letting wetland dry in summer. However, these are exactly the \nnatural dynamic of several Mediterranean coastal wetlands. Due to the intervention, the coast is retreating \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nin some areas, but it is accreting in others; a protecting natural sand bar has been forming behind the \ncollapsed dike, while the naturalised wetland offers a protecting buffer zone. \nNo major barriers in the assessment have been reported. The French Littoral Conservatory designed a \ngovernance scheme involving three other institutions, some also providing the needed political support to \nthe project implementation. \nActually, a clear mandate and objectives and related political support have been indicated as major success \nfactors for the initiative. Extensive communication/consultation, also about assessment results, is \nconsidered very important as well, and therefore will be strengthened. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nName of case: Dijle River Restoration, Belgium \n \nCountry: Belgium. \nContact person: Francis Turkelboom (Institute for Nature and Forest Research - INBO). \nClimate impacts: Flood. \n \nBrief about the case: After a long decision-making process (lasting about 25 years), a plan to implement a \ntechnical solution (construction of storm basins) was largely abandoned in favour of a NBS that is based \non the restoration of the natural floodplains of the Dijle river to protect the city of Leuven (Belgium) from \nflooding, while also maintaining habitats and biodiversity in the valley. The implementation of the NBS \ntook 5 years (2000 \u2013 2005). In 2012-2013 a comparative social cost benefit assessment (sCBA) was carried \nout to evaluate the project against a grey alternative (see also see publication \nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-021-01548-4). \n \nRole of climate change adaptation (CCA) / disaster risk reduction (DRR): When the project was initiated \n(2000) the main purpose was DRR, particular flood management. The issue of CCA only recently come up \n(within the policy agencies responsible for the water management), and current strategies are reconsidered (e.g., as 100-year flood events now seem to become 30-years flood events). \n \nNBS measures implemented: floodplain restoration (bring back natural flooding regime, restore alluvial \nfloodplain ecosystem, reconnection rivers with their floodplains). \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: 1) environmental impact assessment (EIA) (ex-ante); 2) economic \nassessment (comparative social cost-benefit (sCBA) assessment, accounting for all costs and benefits \nwhich will be affected differently by the grey and green intervention) (ex-post). The sCBA made use of \nqualitative (interviews, survey with key stakeholders, expert knowledge) and quantitative methods (apply \nexisting models (i.e., Nature Value Explorer), data from existing literature, and a choice experiment). There \nare many more assessments carried out in the area, focusing mainly on hydrology and biodiversity, as the \narea is also the \u2018backyards of the university (of Leuven)\u2019. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: environmental impact assessment: planning and implementation of grey \ninfrastructure; sCBA: evaluation of green (in place) vs grey (hypothetical) solutions by assessing multiple \nbenefits (flood control, water quality, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, air quality, recreation and \nlandscape experience) and costs in monetary terms. \n \nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method): 1) EIA: policy driven assessment: they suggested \na comparison study in cooperation with the water management agency; 2) sCBA: requested by the forest \nand nature agency to document Flemish example of NBS; specific assessment type/methods evolved \nthroughout the project (depending on data availability, time, stakeholders and steering committee \ninput/needs). \n \nUse of assessment outputs: demonstration and awareness raising NBS (how nature and water \nmanagement and other functions can go together; case is used by the Nature and Forest Agency and Water \nmanagement Agency to showcase a successful NBS example; illustration of the differences in costs of both \noptions (grey/green) and the multiple benefits helped to support the argumentation of the client to \nuse/invest in nature); good illustration of how to improve collaboration/cooperation among different \nstakeholders in water management. \n \nFunding and budget: the NBS project (i.e., restoring floodplains) was primarily funded by the Flanders \nenvironmental agency (i.e., VMM, who is responsible for the water infrastructure); the comparative sCBA \nwas fully funded by INBO (research institute); VMM is measuring/monitoring the river, other organization \n(e.g., local NGO, INBO) monitor other aspects (e.g., biodiversity) in the valley (which is a Natura2000 site). \n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-021-01548-4\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: stakeholder involvement (throughout the assessment) was \nan important part of the comparative sCBA, especially for data collection; stakeholders include major \npolicy representatives, recreationist/tourists, local stakeholders (land owners, municipalities). For data \ncollection, stakeholders were involved by interview, survey (among recreationist) at the start of the \nassessment. Moreover, a multi-disciplinary expert group (steering committee) was established including \nexperts from various national agencies and research institute. Throughout the 1-year project, there have \nbeen 3 meetings with the steering committee to discuss, refine and validate assessment results. \n \nBarriers & success factors: Challenges: working in a multi-disciplinary team (to understand each other and \nbring all different points of view together) which was at the same time also the added value to the project; \nmethodological challenge e.g., lack of data, not everything is measurable, uncertainties, outdated data. \nSuccesses: policy-driven assessment (clear demand); actuality (recent flooding issues); access to different \nknowledge and background data. \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nCase name: Elbe Dyke Relocation (Lenzen) \n \nCountry: Germany. \nContact person: Christian Damm, Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie (KIT). \nClimate impacts: River flooding. \n \nBrief about the case: \u201cIn the framework of the large-scale nature conservation project \"Lenzener \nElbtalaue\", a dyke along the river Elbe has been relocated. This [project reconnected a former naturally \nflooded] area with a diverse floodplain, re-establishing alluvial forests, half-open pasture landscapes and \nother typical habitats of lowland floodplains. With 420 ha it [was] the biggest application of this type of \nmeasure in Germany [at that time]. The project successfully combines flood protection and nature \nconservation objectives. Since the cutting of the old dyke in 2009, the measure could prove its \neffectiveness during several high-water events.\u201d Source: NWRM  \nhttp://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf \n \nRole of Adaptation / DRR: Nature conservation (re-establishing floodplain forest) was the first motivation \nof the project with flood protection becoming increasingly important after the 2002 Elbe-Flood. At the \ntime when the project was developed climate change and the need for climate change adaptation was not \npart of the discussion. However, today the implemented dyke relocation is an important contribution to \nclimate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. \n \nNBS measures implemented: \u201cThe specific measures applied include: Construction of a new, 6.1 km long \ndyke which has been shifted backward up to 1.3 km; Opening of the old, 7.2 km long dyke, situated close \nto the river, in Sections of 200-500 m length; Planting of 160 ha of alluvial forest, with further 130 ha of \nsuccession areas for alluvial forests; Establishment of half-open pasture landscapes on 85 ha; Profiling of \n45 ha of flood channels in the area [contained] by the relocated dyke; Implementation of a land \n[consolidation scheme] in order to make areas available for the project.\u201d Source: NWRM \nhttp://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: \nTechnical/physical NBS impact: Before the project, the Biosphere Reserve Middle Elbe conducted an \nassessment of opportunities and limits of dyke relocation which provided important data. Originally, the \nmain purpose of the project was biodiversity conservation. After a major flood event in 2002 the floodalleviating role of the dyke relocation became of increasing importance for the project. The project \nassessment involved also intensive biodiversity monitoring (birds, fish, amphibians, soils and vegetation). \nSome of the monitoring related to birds and amphibians continues until today. As this was one of the first \npilot sites for the implementation of large-scale dike relocation, the Federal Waterways Engineering and \nResearch Institute (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Wasserbau) had an interest in particular in the detailed assessments \nof the effect of dyke relocation on flood reduction. Detailed hydrological modeling (two-dimensional, \nhydro-dynamic numerical model) was done before (ex-ante) the implementation in order to assess the \npotential effectiveness of the dyke removal and increase in water retention area on reducing the flood \npeak upstream and downstream. The effectiveness of the dyke relocation was also monitored in detail \nafter the implementation during subsequent flood events. Depending on the importance of the flood \nevent, the effect of the measure on reducing the peak flow has been calculated (compared to the previous \nstatus prior to dyke relocation) (Table 12). \n \nTable 12: Effect of dyke relocation on increasing the floodplain and reducing the peak flow during flood events. \nSource: NWRM http://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf. \nRecurring flood events (discharge) Share of the flow taking place in the newly created floodplain Reduction in peak  flow \n\nEvery 1-2 years (1500 m3/s) 8.6% 9.2 cm \n\nEvery 3-5 years (2300 m3/s) 27.5% 28 cm \n\nEvery 20-25 years (3250 m3/s)  36% 38.9 cm \n\nhttp://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nThis effect has been observed during flood events occurring after the implementation of the dyke \nrelocation. The reduction of (extreme) flood peaks is locally at least between 25 to 35 cm depending on \nthe flood flow rate. The impact of the measures with regards to flood protection could be directly observed \nduring the extreme flood events in January 2011 and June 2013. \n \nEconomic impact: Economic benefits have not been assessed in particular. However, the following benefits \ncould be identified: \n\u2022 Flood protection (water retention) and reduction of flood risk (e.g. in upstream areas). \n\u2022 Reduction in the costs of maintaining the old dyke: flood protection up to the level given today was \n\nonly possible through creating an enlarged floodplain and the restoration of the old dyke would not \nhave been the better alternative. \n\n\u2022 Biodiversity benefits: the strategy of local community involvement and participatory planning with \nfocus on the benefits for biodiversity conservation were critical for creating acceptance and support \nfor the project among local stakeholders. \n\n\u2022 Nutrient retention effects for nitrogen and phosphorous are reported. \n\u2022 Benefits for the regional development: The project area got quickly established as a regional tourist \n\nattraction along the international Elbe bike trail due to the beauty of the restored landscape. Related \nto an environmental education centre and the biosphere reserve\u2019s visitor centre a sustainable increase \nof the number of visitors occurred.  \n\n\u2022 During the construction period there had been some socio-economic effects in terms of local \nemployment and local consumption. For example, thousands of trees used for restoring the floodplains \nwere locally produced in cooperation with local stakeholders. \n\n \nHuman/social/cultural impact: \n\u2022 Enhanced awareness of local community for local biodiversity and the benefits of ecosystems for flood \n\nprotection. \n\u2022 The increase in visitors and tourism enhanced the appreciation of local communities for the landscape. \n\u2022 Employment in local tourism and related services. \n \nEnvironmental impact: \n\u2022 Enhanced biodiversity with value for resident and migratory bird species as well as a number of \n\nfloodplain related plant communities. \n\u2022 Floodplains provide nutrient retention in particular during flood events. \n\u2022 Hydrological restoration of the floodplain area. \n \nPurpose of NBS assessment: The main purpose of the hydrological modeling and assessments were to \nidentify the potential effectiveness of opening the old dyke and the relocation of the new dyke for reducing \nthe peak flow during flood events (Step 3 and 4 of the adaptation cycle related to identifying and assessing \nadaptation options). During and after the implementation, intensive monitoring of the hydrology and \nbiodiversity were conducted in order to assess the effectiveness of the measures (Step 6 of the adaptation \ncycle on monitoring and evaluation). With regards to the disaster risk reduction (DRR) cycle the \nassessments and monitoring relates to: (i) planning and implementation of NBS; (ii) showing clear benefits \nof the measures for DRR during the flood event; and (iii) as pilot site the experience contributes to \nassessing DRR mitigation options in similar sites. However, the original starting point for the project was \nthe motivation to implement dyke relocation for habitat restoration and biodiversity conservation. \nBesides CCA and DRR, the assessment contributed additional purposes including: (i) benefits for water \nmanagement related to water quality and nutrient retention, (ii) green space management related to local \ncommunity involvement and tourism; (iii) biodiversity enhancement through habitat restoration; (v) \nhabitat regeneration through restoration of the riparian habitats and their natural hydrology; (vi) \nknowledge and social capacity building through community involvement and environmental education; \n(vii) social justice and social cohesion as the project contributed significantly to local development and \nincome (e.g. tourism) in one of the poorest regions of Germany; (viii) health and wellbeing as the project \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nimproved opportunities for recreation; (ix) new economic opportunities and green jobs during and after \nthe implementation of the project (in particular in tourism and environmental education) in an area of \nGermany with little employment opportunities. \n \nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method): As this was one of the first pilot sites for a dyke \nrelocation in Germany, the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr \nWasserbau) had a particular interest in conducting detailed assessments and monitoring of the effect of \ndyke relocation on flood reduction. For the biodiversity monitoring typical indicators and habitat \ncharacteristics have been assessed and monitored (birds, fish, amphibians, soils and vegetation), being \ninitiated partly by the project supporting agencies (mainly the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation) \nrequesting specific monitoring, partly by the state biosphere reserve\u2019s regular and FFH-related monitoring \nactivities. \n \nUse of assessment outputs: The NBS project was a pilot project on dyke relocation for flood mitigation \nand biodiversity conservation. Hence there was a particular interest from the different agencies involved \nfrom local to the federal level and the project had support from the highest political level within the federal \nstate. This was important for moving the project forward. In particular the Federal Waterways Engineering \nand Research Institute (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Wasserbau) had an interest in assessing and demonstrating the \neffect of dyke relocation on flood reduction. As a follow-up of this successful project there are about 10 \nsimilar projects in implementation stage and further projects in a planning stage. \n \nFunding and budget: \n1. Construction costs of the new dyke: 11.5 million \u20ac. \n2. Costs for opening the old dyke: 1.5 million \u20ac. \n3. Unknown amount for the compensation to farmers for abandoning farmland (444.5 ha) that has been \n\nturned into a floodplain. \n \n\u201cThe new dyke has been financed by the Land Brandenburg, supported by national and European means \n(funding from the German Joint Task program of the Federal government and the federal States for the \nimprovement of the agrarian structures and coast protection; GAK). [The opening of the old dyke as well \nas the restoration measures have been 75% financed by the German government from a federal budget \nfor \u201clarge-scale conservation projects\u201d with 18 % contribution by the State of Brandenburg.] The remaining \n7% came from the [project executing] organization Burg Lenzen e.V., in alliance with different nature \nconservation NGOs. [\u2026] Thanks to the multifunctionality of the measures applied (nature conservation, \nflood protection), [a combination of different financial resources was possible]. Furthermore, to benefit \nfrom all financing sources, a private body was needed as applicant, and an association (Tr\u00e4gerverbund \nBurg Lenzen e.V.) has been created with different stakeholders for this purpose.\u201d Source: NWRM \nhttp://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: Local stakeholders include local farmers (mainly one largescale holding company that evolved from a former GDR enterprise (\u201cLPG\u201d)), municipality, mayor, local \nstakeholders involved in tourism (private accommodation and hotels). They were consulted and involved \nbefore and after the implementation. \nBarriers & success factors: Barriers: \u201cReflections on a dyke relocation for purely hydraulic reasons had \nstarted in the 1960s but had not been further followed up mainly due to financial reasons as well as the \nfrontier status of the area (between Eastern and Western Germany). The issues of hunting and fishing as \nwell as the accessibility of the area had been the main controversial issues coming up in the public \nparticipation process but they could be solved to a large extent. Financing had been a problem at some \npoint, but could be resolved.\u201d \nSource: NWRM http://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbefinal_version.pdf \nFactors of success: As pilot the project had the political support up to the highest level within the federal \nstate. This helped to ensure the support from public agencies as well as some local stakeholders. \n\nhttp://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nStakeholder consultations and facilitation at the beginning about the value of dyke relocation for flood \nmitigation and nature conservation helped to gain support among local stakeholders. After \nimplementation the benefits (flood mitigation, conservation and an increase in tourism) were well \nperceived and helped increasing the acceptability notably. \u201cThe project shows a successful combination \nof nature conservation, flood protection and other objectives (agricultural, regional development, and \nothers). The continuous [efforts on persuasion of a few local players over several years] is highlighted as \none key factor for the successful implementation of the project. The prior implementation of research \nprojects ensured the effectiveness of the measure design, but was also very useful for providing support \nfor public discussion. The measures are suitable to be applied also elsewhere. However, areas [largely] \nfree of settlement are needed.\u201d Source: NWRM \nhttp://nwrm.eu/sites/default/files/case_studies_ressources/cs-de-01-elbe-final_version.pdf \n  \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nName of case: Green roofs: Combining mitigation and adaptation measures \n \nCountry: Switzerland. \nContact person: Stephan Brenneisen (Institute for Environment and Natural Resources Zurich \nUniversity of Applied Sciences ZHAW). \nClimate impacts: Storm water management, energy savings. \n \n\nBrief about the case: The Green Roof \n(GR) programme started in 1996 with \na campaign, including financial \nsupport, for GRs on flat roofs in Basel. \nThe campaign was motivated by \nenergy savings, although other \nbenefits, e.g., storm water \nmanagement was also recognized. \nThe campaign lead to the \nestablishment of approximately \n80.000m2 of GRs. A couple of years \nlater, a second campaign with cofunding was made available. \n \n \nPhoto: Stephan Brenneisen \n\n \nIn 2000, GRs became part of the building code, making GRs mandatory on flat roofs in Basel, and today \nGR requirements also apply in relation to retrofitting of flat roofs. GRs are no longer supported \nfinancially. In 2006, around 23% of flat roofs in Basel were green, today the share is estimated to have \nincreased to around 40%. It is expected that the city will gain renewed interest in GR as a climate \nadaptation measure. \n \nRole of climate change adaptation (CCA) / DRR: The main purpose of the project was not specifically \nCCA/DRR, but storm water management and energy savings. \n \nNBS measures implemented: Green roofs. \n \nType of NBS assessment implemented: \nTechnical/physical NBS impact assessments: In 2007 an inventory was made of the number/extent of \nGRs in Basel. It is hoped, that city authorities can be convinced to update the inventory, perhaps even \nmake updates mandatory. There has not been any studies on the effects of the roofs on storm water \nmitigation. \nEconomic impact: Following the 1st GR campaign it was estimated that the 1 million Swiss Franc made \navailable to support private installation of GRs released 9 million Swiss Francs of private investments, \nand lead to the establishment of 120 GRs (around 80.000m2). An assessment was also made by the \ncity of how much energy was saved from the measure. \nEnvironmental impact: Long term monitoring of species living on green roofs in Basel. Monitoring \nbased on ex-post (after the GRs are established) and on-going in-situ measurements related to \nquantitative indicators (species), accounting for spatial and temporal variation. Indicator species are \nsnails, butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers, spiders. The assessment has revealed a fair share of redlisted species present on the roofs. In total 25 roofs are monitored, varying in size, substrate depth, \ndirection etc. The monitoring has taken place since 2013, and is performed every two weeks in the \nperiod April-October. No modelling is performed. \n \n\f\n \n\nETC/CCA Technical Paper -2021/3 Annex 4 \n\nPurpose of NBS assessment: Assess the benefit of GRs for biodiversity and investigate how different \nfactors affect the benefits (e.g.,size, substrate thickness). \n \nDrivers of assessment (reason for choosing the method): Primary driver was scientific interest and \nknowledge (personal). Ideal situation: money, knowledge, time and people were available. \n \nUse of assessment outputs: Results used for scientific publications and reports aimed at collegial \nexchange of knowledge and at providing input for planners and architects. Videos have also been \ncreated, e.g., showing how to implement monitoring in practice, thereby allowing others to replicate \nthe methods and creating a basis for conducting comparative analyses. Results also used as input to \nbuilding code, and for establishing a framework that can be used by other cantons. The interview \nperson is a member of the Swiss norm committee on GRs; once the long term monitoring data has \nbeen analysed in full, he expects it will provide sufficient proof of the benefit of GRs for biodiversity \nsuch that GRs become included in the building code for flat buildings in all of Switzerland. In 2005 the \nfirst World Conference on GRs were held in Basel, showing what had been done; another World \nConference on GRs is planned to be held in Basel in 2024. Dialogue with industry on how to make it as \neasy and good as possible; industry tends to complicate. Excursions arranged where people can come \nand see GRs with their own eyes; makes it easier to understand the idea behind GRs and which factors \nshould be considered when establishing GRs. \n \nFunding and budget: The funding for the two GR campaigns came from an energy fund in Basel. 5% of \nenergy bills go to this fund, which purpose is to support measures of energy savings. Initial monitoring \nof species in GRs was also financed by this fund. Since GRs have become part of the building code, \nfunding from the fund has ceased. The city pays for consulting services and development of guidelines \nrelated to the establishment of GRs. Funding for the ongoing monitoring of biodiversity on GRs is \nprovided by the Federal Ministry of Environment. \n \nProvisions/structures in place for carrying out long-term assessments: Monitoring has taken place \nsince 2013 and continues until 2023; the Federal Ministry of Environment finances this long term \nmonitoring. \n \nVulnerability and stakeholder involvement: Permissions for making assessments, e.g., in relation to \naccess to GRs, are required, but they are granted via standard procedures. Otherwise no real \ninvolvement of stakeholders. Good cooperation with the city. \n \nBarriers & success factors for the NBS assessments: Barriers: Since GR requirements have become \npart of the building code in Basel, in many cases the establishment/design tends to follow the specified \nminimum requirements rather that focus on optimising the design. When making excursions to GRs it \nis always the same people that comes (i.e. those interested in nature) \u2013 challenge to attract other \nrelevant stakeholders. Success factors: Money, knowledge, time and people for making the \nassessments. \n\n \n \n\f\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEuropean Topic Centre on Climate Change  \nimpacts, vulnerability and Adaptation  \n(ETC/CCA) \nc/o Fondazione CMCC - Centro Euro- \nMediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici \nV.le Berti Pichat 6/2  \n40127 Bologna, Italy \nWeb: http://cca.eionet.europa.eu/  \nEmail: silvia.medri@cmcc.it \n\nThe European Topic Centre on Climate Change \nimpacts, vulnerability and Adaptation (ETC/CCA) \nis a consortium of European institutes under \ncontract of the European Environment Agency.", "Indicators play a critical role to monitor a city\u2019s progress and learn from the results. Measurable indicators are also attractive to policy and decision makers as they provide quantifiable \"evidence\" of impacts, progress and performance.\nThis section helps local authorities to define a framework for monitoring indicators.\nDefining and putting in place the most appropriate and practicable indicators can be a challenge, due to factors such as data availability but also because of the difficulty of measuring actual progress towards increased resilience. For example, if only the number of trees planted are measured, it may not be accounted for the fact that planting young trees will not immediately lead to improved thermal comfort on a square or a street.\nIt is crucial to choose indicators which reflect as closely as possible the adaptation objectives that the city has set for itself (see Step 2.6). When identifying appropriate indicators both for monitoring and evaluating the process of adaptation and its outcomes, the following may be considered:\nThe baselines for indicators should include the effects of future climate change, particularly for projects with long-term implications, such as investments in infrastructure.\nThere is no need to reinvent the wheel - many adaptation processes may already be measured through existing indicators and existing M&E systems can be adjusted to better account for adaptation.\nRecognise that M&E systems are dependent on proxy indicators that are also subject to a range of other influences, i.e. achievements often cannot solely be attributed to sound adaptation practice but can be a result of other influencing factors.\nDevelop a combination of process and outcome indicators, recognising that in some cases adaptation outcomes cannot be determined for many years.\nIndicators must serve a clear purpose and should be relevant. Another important factor in choosing indicators is whether data can be collected effectively and efficiently; collecting data should not be more costly than the value of the information they provide.\nThe total set of indicators should allow to consider all aspects that affect the adaptation objectives.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

In fact, the two are closely entwined, as climate change \naccelerates biodiversity loss and healthy ecosystems are a vital ally in the fight against \nclimate change.\n\nEurope continues to lose biodiversity at an \nalarming rate, with many species, habitats \nand ecosystems in Europe threatened \nby intensive agriculture, urban sprawl, \npollution, unsustainable forestry, invasive \nalien species and climate change. Recent \nassessments by the European Environment \nAgency show that most protected species \nand habitats do not currently have a good \nconservation status.\n\nThese losses are not limited to Europe \neither. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem \ndegradation are a global phenomenon. So, \nas we observe this loss, and work to slow, \nstop and eventually reverse it, we are faced \nwith the challenge of understanding and \neven quantifying nature\u2032s value. This will \nhelp not only to make the right personal, \nbusiness and policy decisions but also to \nbetter understand our place as humans \nwithin nature. What is the value of nature?\n\nAs human beings, nature is priceless to us. \nAfter all, it was nature that provided the \nbuilding blocks of life and the surroundings \nnecessary to allow Homo sapiens to evolve \nat least 300 000 years ago. Fast-forward to \ntoday and we still cannot live without nature. \nIn fact, we might be more dependent than \n\never on healthy and resilient ecosystems \nto guarantee long-term wellbeing for a (still) \ngrowing number of global citizens.\n\nOur atmosphere, forests, rivers, oceans and \nsoils continue to provide us with the air we \nbreathe, the food we eat, the water we drink \nand the raw materials we consume, as well \nas spaces for recreation and recovery. This is \noften described as nature\u2032s use value.\n\nIn this context, efforts have been made \nto put a monetary value on this \u2032natural \ncapital\u2032, so that we can frame the \n\u2032ecosystem services\u2032 it provides within our \nexisting economic models. Indeed, the EU \nbiodiversity strategy for 2030 states that \nmore than half of global gross domestic \nproduct \u2014 some EUR 40 trillion \u2014 depends \non nature.\n\nThe picture is complex, however. Some \necosystem services are more tangible and \nrelatively easy to quantify, such as crops, \nfisheries and timber; other services, less \nso. How does one accurately account for \nthe value of pollination for agriculture or \nflood protection by wetlands? Properly \nunderstanding and accounting for less \nvisible ecosystem services is crucial.\n\f\n6 \u00a9 Mateusz Piesiak, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\f\n7\n\nBut the value of nature goes beyond the \ndirect services it provides to us. Nature has \ncultural value too, forming the backdrop to \nour existence as humans and providing the \nconditions necessary for good physical and \nmental health, as well as for emotional and \nspiritual well-being.\n\nEven this is not the end of the story. \nAcknowledging nature\u2032s use value and \ncultural value, we sound very egocentric, \nin danger of focusing exclusively on the \nbenefits to us as human beings in the here \nand now. Nature has intrinsic value in its \nown right, in which human involvement \nis limited to the role of custodian, with an \nethical responsibility towards nature itself, \nour own society and particularly that of \nfuture generations.\n\nThis three-pronged approach is one way to \nunderstand the value of nature: use value, \ncultural value and intrinsic value.\n\nYet we tend to take nature for granted, \nseeing it as a \u2032free\u2032 resource from which we \ncan take not only what we need but also \nwhat we want. This makes understanding \nand acknowledging the true value of \nnature more important than ever. As \ncounter-intuitive as it may seem to put a \nmonetary value on nature, measurement \nand accounting is one way to appreciate \nthe direct and indirect benefits we derive \nfrom nature. It may also help us choose the \nbest approaches to tackling degradation, \nunderstanding, for example, that it is much \ncheaper to protect nature in the first place \nthan to restore it later \u2014 if restoration is \neven an option.\n\nAs we become more acutely aware of the \nfinite nature of natural resources, and \nthe increasing demands we are placing \non the natural world, we must find ways \nto live within the means of our planet. \nTechnological advances and population \ngrowth, particularly over the last 100\u00a0years, \nmean that Homo sapiens has come to \ndominate the food chain and nature\u2032s \nresources. The damage we have caused \nalong the way is starting to dominate our \nprospects for future wellbeing.\n\nRestoring nature \u2014 and more \nfundamentally, restoring and re-imagining \nour own relationship to it \u2014 are \ncentral and urgent challenges for the \nnext\u00a0decades.\n\nHans Bruyninckx\nEEA Executive Director\n\f\nWhat are ecosystem services?\nNature provides us with many valuable services.

In the wake of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic restrictions many of us headed outside to our nearest green \nspaces for respite and solace \u2014 necessary breaks from our lockdown existence. It once \nagain reminded us of the vital and valued role that our nature plays in our mental and \nphysical\u00a0well-being.\n\nUnfortunately, centuries of exploitation \nhave taken a massive toll on Europe\u2032s \nbiodiversity. Our nature is in a poor \nstate, with the majority of Europe\u2032s many \nanimal species, such as the saker falcon \nand the Danube salmon, and habitats \nfrom grasslands to dunes across Europe \nfacing an uncertain future unless urgent \naction is taken to reverse the situation.\n\nThis is the dire conclusion of the EEA\u2032s \nlatest State of nature in the EU1 report, \nwhich is the most comprehensive health \ncheck ever conducted by the EU.\n\nThe good news is that awareness of the \nimportance of nature and biodiversity \nis growing and steps to remedy the \nsituation are already in motion. The EEA\u2032s \nState of nature report does show positive \ndevelopments in conservation\u00a0efforts.\n\nBoth the number and area of sites \nprotected under the EU\u2032s Natura 2000 \nnetwork have increased over the last \n6\u00a0years, and the EU met the global \ntargets, with around 18 % of its land \narea and nearly 10 % of its marine \narea\u00a0protected.\n\nHowever, overall progress has not been \nenough to achieve the aims of the old EU \nbiodiversity strategy to 2020. Most protected \nhabitats and species have either a poor \nor a bad conservation status and many \nof them continue to decline. Of the three \nmain groups studied, habitats and birds lag \nparticularly far behind, while the group of \nnon-bird species nearly met its target.\n\nPollinators in decline, marine \nenvironment threatened...\n\nInsects, and especially bees, are also \nin decline, according to EEA and other \nresearch. What is certain is that about 9 % of \nbees are threatened with extinction within \nthe EU, according to the European Red List2. \nHowever, for most bee species, there is not \nenough scientific information to evaluate \ntheir risk of extinction.\n\nThe EEA\u2032s State of nature in the EU report \nidentified that pollinators\u2032 most important \nhabitats \u2014 grasslands, scrublands, bogs, \nmires, fens and forests \u2014 often have poor \nconservation status. The main reason for this \nsituation is the abandonment of grassland, \nfarmland expansion and the use of fertilisers.\n\f\n12\n\nThe situation in Europe\u2032s coastal waters \u2014\nfrom the Baltic to the Mediterranean \u2014 is \njust as alarming. Urgent action is needed \nto bring Europe\u2032s marine ecosystems back \nto good condition, after years of severe \noverexploitation and neglect, according to \nthe latest EEA report looking into Europe\u2032s \nmarine environment3.\n\nThe impact of human activities on land \nand use of our seas has resulted in changes \nin the number and distribution of marine \nspecies and habitats and changes in the \noverall physical and chemical make-up \nof seas. Adding to this, problems caused \nby climate change are worsening the \nimpacts of the other threats, and are set \nto change marine ecosystems irreversibly. \nHowever, there are signs of recovery in \nsome areas because of ongoing efforts \nto reduce certain impacts, such as those \ncaused by contaminants, eutrophication \nand\u00a0overfishing.\n\nMeasures to tackle challenges\n\nOverall, there are now more ambitious plans \nin place to address the challenges, including \nthe new EU biodiversity strategy for 20304, \nthe farm to fork strategy5 and the EU \nstrategy on adaptation to climate change6, \nwhich are all core elements of the European \nGreen\u00a0Deal7.\n\nThe biodiversity strategy is meant to reverse \nthe decline in biodiversity over the next \ndecade. It aims to strengthen and enlarge \nthe network of protected areas, set up a \nrestoration plan and ensure that ecosystems \nare healthy, resilient to climate change and \n\nrich in biodiversity, and deliver the range \nof services essential for citizens\u2032 prosperity \nand\u00a0well-being.\n\nExtra efforts will also be needed to improve \nmonitoring capacities in Member States \nto support the EU targets. More data are \nalso needed to better evaluate the role \nof the Natura 2000 network, and the \nimplementation of EU legislation must be \nsignificantly improved.\n\nAre we facing a sixth \nmass\u00a0extinction?\n\nDespite these efforts, concerns remain over \nwhether this action comes too late. Is our \nnature in Europe and elsewhere around the \nworld already facing a new, so-called sixth \nmass extinction wave that will threaten our \nown human existence as well?\n\nWhile scientists and experts are divided, \nconcerns are growing that such a mass event \nhas been under way for some years already. \nThe loss of the West African black rhinoceros \nin the wild received global headlines a decade \nago, but many more species, including in \nEurope8, have mostly disappeared.\n\nThese include the houting, a freshwater \nwhitefish, which used to be found in \nBelgium, Denmark, France, Germany and the \nNetherlands, and which those countries are \nnow trying to reintroduce. A further six bird \nspecies, including the desert warbler and the \nnorthern bald ibis, are considered regionally \nor totally extinct. Europe\u2032s Red List of species \nbelieved to be extinct also includes several \nspecies of butterflies, mollusks and plants.\n\f\n13\u00a9 Carlo Gabrielli, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nThe EEA\u2032s European environment \u2014\u00a0state \nand outlook 20209 report (SOER 2020) \nnotes that decades of accelerated social \nand economic activity have transformed \nhumanity\u2032s relationship with the \nenvironment. While delivering many \nbenefits, including alleviating suffering and \npoverty, they have also caused widespread \ndamage to ecosystems.\n\nSimilarly, leading United Nations experts \nhave already sounded the alarm bell \nthat our exploitation of nature, air and \nwater pollution at the hands of a growing \nglobal human population is having a \ndisastrous impact on our biodiversity, as is \nclimate\u00a0change.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Science-Policy \nPlatform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem \nServices (IPBES) latest Global Assessment, \npublished in 201910, estimated that 1 million \nanimal and plant species are threatened \nwith extinction worldwide, many of them \nthought to be insects. The report notes that \nit is not too late to reverse the situation if \nwe move quickly to cut greenhouse gas \nemissions, which fuel climate change, and \nstop the exploitation of natural resources.\n\f\nState of nature in the EU\nThe EEA's latest 'State of nature in the EU' report shows alarming results from the 2013-2018 reporting \nperiod.

Three quarters of \nnew and emerging infectious diseases are transmitted to humans from animals11, and \nthe emergence of such pathogens, especially outside Europe, is linked to intensified \nagriculture, environmental degradation and human interaction with animals in the \nfood\u00a0system.\n\nBeyond the causes of the pandemic, the resulting lockdowns have given us a rare \nglimpse into a world with significantly decreased economic activity and mobility. In \nEurope, many anecdotal stories were shared about the apparently changing behavior \nand distribution of wildlife, reinforcing our knowledge of nature\u2032s ability to return and \nrecover quickly in the absence of human influence. What have been clearly quantified \nare significant improvements in air and water quality, which may have a positive impact \non animals and ecosystems.\n\nAn increased desire to spend time in nature during the pandemic has also been \nreported in studies. During lockdowns, people sought refuge and recreation in forests, \nparks, beaches and other open areas, sometimes discovering amazing nature close to \ntheir homes. This may help people appreciate nature better, but it may also increase \npressure on protected areas. What is certain is that we must take this opportunity to \nstudy and learn from the causes, effects and impacts of the pandemic on us and also \non\u00a0nature.\n\f\n\u00a9 Juan Miguel, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 17\n\f\n18\n\nIn\nte\n\nrv\nie\n\nw\n\nPetr Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161ek\nMember of the coordination \nteam of the European Breeding \nBird Atlas 2, Czech Society \nfor\u00a0Ornithology\n\n\u00a9 Jorge Ruiz del Olmo, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\f\n19\n\nVital role of bird monitors\nMonitoring wildlife and habitats plays a key role in expert assessments. We spoke with \nPetr Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161ek, member of the coordination team of the European Breeding Bird Atlas 2 at \nthe Czech Society for Ornithology, about how such information and data are put together \non a European scale and what challenges bird populations face today.\n\nWhat work do you do specifically?\n\nI am involved in two international initiatives \nin bird monitoring: the second European \nBreeding Bird Atlas (EBBA2) and the \nPan-European Common Bird Monitoring \nScheme (PECBMS), both organised within the \nEuropean Bird Census Council (EBCC). My \nposition is hosted by the Czech Society for \nOrnithology (CSO).\n\nThe European Atlas was published as a book \nin December 2020, but the work is not over. \nWe are busy with an online version, making \nthe outputs available to research and \nconservation and building capacity for bird \nmonitoring in European countries where it \nis needed. The latter is closely linked to the \nPECBMS, but setting up a representative \nand sustainable bird monitoring scheme is \na challenge, and we need more monitoring \nsystems, especially in southern and eastern \nparts of Europe.\n\nHow does your work contribute \nto the assessments done by \nthe\u00a0EEA?\n\nThe wild bird indicators produced by \nPECBMS are directly used by the EEA. \nTogether with the population index of \ngrassland butterflies, the population index \nof common birds in Europe contributes to \nthe EEA\u2032s set for the indicator \u2032Abundance \nand distribution of selected species \nin\u00a0Europe\u203212.  \n\nThe outputs of our work have been used \nin the State of nature in the EU report \nand other publications. We have been \nin regular contact with colleagues in \nthe EEA and coordinate our efforts and \nthe feedback from the EEA is extremely \nimportant. Recently, we started \nexploring how the atlas data (EBBA2) \ncan contribute to the work of bodies like \nthe\u00a0EEA.\n\f\n20\n\nHow did you get interested in this \narea of work?\n\nProbably as many other ornithologists, \nsince my childhood I have been interested \nin birds, nature and conservation. I studied \nzoology at the Charles University in Prague \nwhere I did my Master\u2032s degree and PhD \non buzzards. Then I took an opportunity to \nwork for the CSO as a director, where I was \nthe only paid employee at the time.\n\nThe link between scientific knowledge and \npolicy is the main issue that keeps me \ninterested in large-scale bird monitoring and \natlas work. Working with diverse people, \nvarious methodological approaches and \ncultural differences make this kind of work \nexciting too. I also appreciate fieldwork, \nwhich, although not automatically part of the \njob, is the key issue that helps to understand \nthe data and the needs of the fieldworkers \nand makes one happy.\n\nHow do you assess a species\u2032 \nhealth?\n\nThe main output of our work is collecting \ninformation about the changes in the \nabundance of birds and their distribution. \nIn other words, where the birds are, \nhow many there are and how these two \nparameters change. It is a long process that \nstarts with standard fieldwork following a \nstrict methodology.  \n\nIt is not possible to cover Europe with \nprofessional fieldworkers only. But \nornithology takes advantage of a crowd of \namateur ornithologists or birdwatchers, \n\nwho know birds and are keen to follow the \nmethodology. Thanks to them, we can get \nthe data from all of Europe in EBBA2 and \nfrom 28 countries in PECBMS.  \n\nThe fieldworkers have to survey birds at \nprescribed sites, which are often selected \nin a randomised manner in order to ensure \nthat the sample is representative. The \nobserver counts all birds seen or heard at \ntheir site and records other characteristics, \nhelping better assessment of the data at \nspecific day times and dates.\n\nRecordings for the distribution atlas also \nrequire information about the probability \nof breeding. Most of the surveys are done \nin early morning hours, when many birds \nare most active in spring, but some species \nare surveyed in the evenings, too. Then, \nthe fieldworkers send the data to the \nnational coordinators, who perform data \nquality checks and submit the data to the \nEuropean\u00a0coordinators.\n\nHow does this monitoring help \ngovernments in taking action?\n\nInformation about bird distribution and \nabundance helps decision-makers to \nprioritise management and conservation \nactions. The information about population \ntrends and changes in the distribution \nserves as a signal of the health of bird \npopulations and of the wider environment.  \n\nMonitoring outputs are regularly used in \nan assessment of a conservation status of \nspecies, including the European Red List \ncategorisation. Changes in abundance and \n\f\n\u00a9 Antonio Piris, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 21\n\f\n22\n\ndistribution of groups of species, such as \nfarmland birds, provide signals about the \nhealth of a particular habitat type or the \nimpact of a large-scale phenomenon like \nclimate change.  \n\nLinking the monitoring data with \nenvironmental or other variables can tell us \nmore about forces driving the trends; it can \nhelp to shape management practices\u00a0too.\n\nHow do environmental \ndegradation and climate change \nimpact bird life?\n\nThe changes in European landscapes and \nclimate are sometimes dramatic and they \naffect bird populations. However, the \nimpact is not uniform: some species benefit \nfrom the changes, others do not. Overall, \nhowever, it appears that there are more \nlosers than winners.\n\nIntensive land use is leaving less resource \nfor birds \u2014 this is the main human pressure. \nThis is particularly evident for farmland and \nbirds using this type of habitat. Intensive \nagricultural practices, including excessive \nuse of pesticides and fertilisers, heavy \nmachinery or removal of fallow land, makes \nmodern farmland less and less suitable for \nbirds and other wildlife.  \n\nOverall, the homogenisation of agricultural \nfields has a negative effect on biodiversity. \nThe farmland bird index in Europe declined \nby 57 % between 1980 and 201813 and the \ndistribution range of the farmland birds as \n\na group shrunk in the last 30 years in \nEurope (EBBA2). Regionally, we also see \na negative effect of intensive forestry, \nland abandonment or intensive use of \ninland\u00a0wetlands.\n\nBreeding ranges are moving north. We \nobserve a 28 km shift of the centres of \nthe distribution range northwards on \naverage. Although not all these changes \nare caused by climate change, the effect \nis obvious. We also detect the impact \nof climate change on bird populations: \nspecies with a preference for colder \nclimates are declining and those that \nprefer warmer climates are increasing.\n\nCan we still turn things around \nfor the better?\n\nWe have documented positive trends in \ndistribution of several protected species \nfor which conservation measures have \ntaken place (for instance white-tailed sea \neagle or white stork). Also, in PECBMS we \nhave shown that conservation can work, \nand especially Natura 2000 sites can be \nbeneficial, also for non-target species. \nThis suggests that conservation can \nreverse negative trends.  \n\nThe problem is that we still don\u2032t do \nenough, partly because of limited \nresources and partly because traditional \nconservation approaches (especially \nprotected species, nature reserves) are \nnot sufficient to help biodiversity in the \nwider\u00a0countryside.  \n\f\n23\n\nWhat can citizens or even hobby \nbird watchers do to help protect \nbirds and their habitats?\n\nBirdwatchers are key factors for a \nknowledge-based conservation of birds \nand biodiversity. They help as volunteer \nfieldworkers taking part in atlases and \nbird monitoring: in EBBA2, some 120 000 \nfieldworkers contributed data, 35 000 \nproviding highly standardised survey data. \nIn PECBMS, around 15 000 fieldworkers take \npart in bird counts.  \n\nWe would not have had such knowledge \nwithout these skilled people \u2014 they \nare absolutely essential. In principle, \neverybody can help \u2014 even observations \nof single species, including those easily \nidentified (like the white stork), can help \ninformed decision-making. With the recent \ndevelopment of online portals organised \nwithin the EBCC initiative EuroBirdPortal14 \nand the development of mobile apps \nenhancing recording and submitting the \nobservations, it is easier than ever before.  \n\nMany birdwatchers participating in bird \nmonitoring schemes and atlases are also \nactive at a local level in conservation. As \nthey know sites where they survey birds, \nthey often serve as guardians of the sites \nand initiate interventions if the sites \nbecome threatened. Their local knowledge \nis a big asset for conservation at the local \nlevel too.\n\n\u00a9 Daiva Vilkelyte, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\f\nConservation status and short-term trends in bird populations\nLess than half of all bird species have a good population status in the EU.\n\nfor more than a half of species.\n\n40 % have poor or bad status.\n\ndue to the lack of information about their \npopulation size and trends.\n\nSeabirds are also among the \ngroups with the most\n\nStorks, herons and pelicans, grebes, loons, \npigeons and doves, and owls each have a \ngood status\n\nLess than a half of all bird \nspecies have a good population\nstatus in the EU,\n\n14 % of all bird species have \nan unknown status\n\nunknown short-term trends.\n\nPopulation status of EU bird species\nand subspecies, by taxonomic order (%)\n\nNote : The total number of all species is 463.

What are the human activities that harm nature the most and how \ncan we stop and reverse current biodiversity loss?\n\nWe humans are the species that has changed \nthe Earth like no other species. We have had \na major impact on almost all other species \nthat share the planet with us and on their \nhabitats. Europe, as one of the most densely \npopulated areas on Earth, is no exception.\n\nAgriculture puts the biggest \npressure on nature\n\nAlmost 40 % of the EU\u2032s land is used for \ngrowing food, according to Eurostat15. While \ntraditional agriculture allowed a diverse \nrange of animals and plants to coexist with \ncrops, changes in agricultural practices since \n1950, in the direction of intensification and \nspecialisation, have contributed to a high \ndegree of biodiversity loss. According to the \nEEA\u2032s State of nature in the EU report16, the \n\nincreased use of fertilisers, irrigation and \npesticides and the intense modification of \nthe land are key pressures on local animals \nand plants, and especially on birds.\n\nPollution by pesticides used in agriculture \nis the main cause of the worrying decline \nin the number of insect-eating birds and \nfarmland \u00a0birds.\n\nOne of the most important pressures \nis the ceasing of traditional grassland \nmanagement. Pollinators, such as bees, \nbumblebees and butterflies, are highly \naffected by it. Fragmentation of the land \nand drainage, for agricultural purposes, \ndestroy the habitats where birds, reptiles and \nsmall mammals used to feed, find shelter \nand breed.\n\f\n28 \u00a9 Marika Frapiccini, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nEurope\u2032s ecological footprint \nin\u00a0the world\n\nEuropeans\u2032 ecological footprint far \nexceeds what Europe\u2032s ecosystems \ncan supply. This has negative \nconsequences for the environment \nwithin and outside Europe.\n\nEuropean production and \nconsumption, which is higher than \nthe global average, contribute to \nenvironmental degradation in other \nparts of the world. For example, more \nthan half of Europeans\u2032 land and water \nconsumption footprints occur outside \nEurope17, including those due to goods \nimported into the EU and consumed by \nEuropeans.\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental \nPlatform for Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services (IPBES)18, about \n75\u00a0% of the terrestrial environment and \n40 % of the marine environment are \nseverely altered globally.\n\nAs the world\u2032s biodiversity is declining, \nand the global ecological footprint \nis already exceeding biocapacity, \nEurope\u2032s ecological deficit may result \nin the depletion of natural capital, \nbiodiversity loss and ecosystem \ncollapse in other parts of the world.\n\nHowever, as the EEA\u2032s European \nenvironment \u2014 state and outlook \n2020 report19 notes, the EU can \nplay a positive role in responding to \nthese global challenges through its \neconomic, diplomatic and trade links \nand its leadership in environmental \ngovernance. Moreover, European \nproduct standards and business \npractices can have positive effects well \nbeyond Europe\u2032s borders.\n\f\n29\n\nFragmenting and \ndamaging\u00a0habitats\n\nUrbanisation is another serious pressure \non nature, but, perhaps surprisingly, \nmost of the damage no longer comes \nfrom converting nature areas to urban \nterritory (11 % of the pressures in this field, \naccording to the EEA\u2032s State of nature in \nthe EU21) but instead from sports, tourism \nand leisure activities (25 % of urban \npressures). However, construction and \nmodification within urban areas also affect \nmany species that are used to living in \nurban habitats (accounting for about 10 % \nof urban pressures).\n\nMoreover, roads, railways, dams and other \ninfrastructure also fragment habitats and \ndestroy landscapes. Traffic disturbs and \nkills wildlife. Soils, as important reservoirs \nof biodiversity, are damaged when \nthey are sealed with buildings, asphalt \nor\u00a0concrete.\n\nMuch of the European coastline is \nmodified for tourism, leaving little space \nfor intact marine and coastal habitats. \nWater birds, such as ducks, geese, herons \nand grebes, and threatened raptors, such \nas the Egyptian vulture and the bearded \nvulture, are severely affected when their \nnesting areas are destroyed. \n\nPollution of water, air and soil\n\nWe often link pollution to industry, \ntransport and energy production, which \nare important sources, but almost 50\u00a0% \nof the pressures on nature related \nto pollution come from agricultural \nemissions to air, water and soil. Pollution \nby pesticides used in agriculture is the \nmain cause of the worrying decline in \nthe number of insect-eating birds and \nfarmland birds. Pesticide pollution also \naffects amphibians, such as frogs, toads \nand salamanders, insects and small \nmammals, including bats, hamsters and \nthe European ground squirrel.\n\nSimilarly, pesticides and fertilisers \nhave negatively affected about 80\u00a0% \nof the 576 butterfly species that \nlive in Europe20. Agriculture is also a \nmajor source of pollution for surface \nwater and for groundwaters, affecting \nmany\u00a0ecosystems.\n\nPollution from agriculture is one of the \nmain problems to be tackled by the EU \nbiodiversity strategy for 2030 and the \nEU\u2032s farm to fork strategy, which aims \nto reduce the use of chemical pesticides \nby half and to promote less intensive \nfarming practices, including at least a \n20\u00a0% reduction in fertiliser use.\n\f\n30\n\nUnsustainable forestry, hunting \nand overfishing\n\nAlmost all of Europe\u2032s forests have been \ntransformed by human interventions. \nEven after reforestation, the nature \nof\u00a0human-managed forests is different. \nFor example, the habitat can be negatively \naffected if there are fewer trees of different \nspecies and ages.\n\nThe removal of dead and old trees and the \nreduction in old-growth forests affects many \nspecies of insects, birds, amphibians, reptiles, \nbats and small mammals, such as the \nwestern barbastelle, the Caucasian squirrel \nand the forest dormouse.\n\nDespite all the protection measures, we still \nsee local deforestation and clearcutting22 \nwithout new trees being planted in Europe.\n\nAt least 52 million wild birds are hunted by \nhumans every year in Europe, according \nto research that covers 26 European \ncountries23. Moreover, illegal killing is \nthreatening many species, particularly birds \nand mammals, while feral and free-ranging \ncats and dogs present an additional threat.\n\nFish are affected by harvesting, as are \nmarine mammals, such as the short-beaked \ncommon dolphin and the harbour porpoise, \nwhich sometimes fall prey to bycatch.\n\nEven when we try to enjoy nature, we may \nunwillingly harm habitats and species \naround us. Many recreational activities, such \nas outdoor sports, leisure aircraft, drones, \nhuman trampling and unregulated wildlife \nwatching, can be very damaging to nature.\n\nAliens are taking over\n\nSometimes intentionally, sometimes by \naccident, Europeans have brought new \nplants and animal species to the continent. \nThese new species are sometimes taking \nover habitats and disturbing ecosystems, \nwhich is why they are called invasive alien \nspecies.\n\nSome of the most damaging invasive aliens \nare American mink, coypu and raccoon, \nwhich have become predators of European \nbirds, and Reeves\u2032s muntjac, which browses \nunderstory habitats. The comb jellyfish, first \nintroduced into the Black Sea through ships\u2032 \nballast water, has devastated certain fish \npopulations.\n\nThere are also alien species of plants that \nare taking over from local ones. False \nindigo-bush, Japanese knotweed and \nHimalayan balsam are just some examples.\n\nClimate change \u2014 the main \nemerging threat to nature\n\nClimate change is already affecting life \nin Europe, with increased temperatures, \ndroughts, changes in rain patterns, wildfires \nand less snow. It is seen as an emerging \nthreat to European species, and it will affect \nmore and more animals and plants.\n\nWe are witnessing local and regional \nextinctions of species, as well as a move \nof the species northwards and uphill. \nAmphibians, birds and bats are the most \naffected species by droughts and changes in \nrain patterns.\n\f\n31\n\nThe EEA\u2032s European environment \u2014\u00a0state \nand outlook 2020 report24 warned \nthat ocean warming, acidification and \ndeoxygenation continue to worsen, \nendangering marine\u00a0habitats.\n\nTo mitigate climate change, we need to \nproduce energy in a sustainable way. \nEurope is leading the efforts towards \ndecarbonisation, aiming to be carbon \nneutral by 2050. This is a critical goal but, \nin some cases, development of renewable \nenergy can harm habitats and species. For \nexample, wind turbines can create a threat \nto bats and birds, which can collide with the \nblades, and dams can block the passage of \nsediments and migratory fish.\n\nIt is crucial, therefore, that all measures \ntowards decarbonisation are taken in a \ncoordinated manner with biodiversity \npolicies, to minimise the impacts on animals \nand habitats. There are many good solutions \nthat benefit both climate and nature, such as \nimproving the state of soils.\n\nThe factors described above are the most \nserious pressures on nature, in Europe, but \nthey are not the only ones. Noise and light \npollution coming from human activity also \nharm many species. There are many issues to \ntackle, but what is clear is that humans must \nlearn again how to give space for nature to \nthrive. Failing to do so urgently could have \nconsequences we cannot reverse.\n\f\nWhat are the main pressures on Europe's nature?\nEurope's biodiversity continues to be shaped by human activity.

We asked Professor \nDr\u00a0Beate Jessel, President of the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, about \nthe links between biodiversity and climate change and what could be done to boost \nnature\u2032s resilience in a changing climate.\n\nHow does climate change \nimpact\u00a0nature?\n\nClimate change is introducing major changes \nto the living conditions of many species \nthrough rising temperatures, changes in \nprecipitation distribution and more frequent \nextreme weather events such as heavy \nrain, storms, heat waves and droughts. \nThis results in a shift in the ranges of many \nspecies and changes in their seasonality and \nthe composition of species communities. As \na result of the lower climatic water balance \nin summer, species in wetlands and water \nbodies are particularly endangered. Even \ndeciduous trees were severely damaged or \naffected by the summer droughts of 2018 \nand 2019 in Germany.\n\nFor some species that previously occurred \ntogether in the same habitat, such as the \nbutterfly scarce large blue (Phengaris teleius) \nand the prey species of its caterpillars, the \ngreat burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), their \nrespective climatically suitable habitats are \nshifting to different locations. This leads to \n\na\u00a0spatial decoupling and thus to a decline in \nthe butterfly population. Similarly, temporal \ndecoupling also occurs, for example when \ninsects start to fly earlier before the flowers \nthey feed on are in blossom, or in the case of \nthe cuckoo, whose host birds start breeding \nearlier than the cuckoo\u2032s return from its \nwinter quarters. Furthermore, species \nfrom warmer regions, including those \nwith invasive potential, can immigrate and \nchange the relationship structure between \nthe species.\n\nCan nature provide us with \nsolutions to address some of \nthese impacts?\n\nNature has a great potential to counteract \nthe impacts of climate change. And there \nare plentiful \u2032nature-based solutions\u2032 that \nnot only support climate adaptation but \nalso provide multiple synergies. Floodplain \nrestoration projects, for example, effectively \ndecrease water levels in rivers in extreme \nflood events and moreover contribute to \nnutrient retention.\n\f\n36\n\nThe restoration of salt marshes helps to \nprotect coasts in temperate zones, while \nin tropical coastal regions flooding impacts \ncan be massively reduced through the \nrestoration of mangroves. Similarly, the \nrewetting of peatlands can lessen drought \neffects. If such nature-based solutions are \napplied thoughtfully, they can combine \nsignificant socio-economic benefits with a \nnet gain for nature and biodiversity.\n\nGlobally, nature-based solutions are \nalready an important component to \naddress climate change impacts. We have \nknowledge, data and tools on hand for \ntheir\u00a0implementation.\n\nWhat is needed to boost nature\u2032s \nresilience to climate change?\n\nTo enhance nature\u2032s resilience to climate \nchange, a coherent and well-connected \nnetwork of protected areas is needed. \nThe European Natura 2000 network \nof protected areas is an important \nbackbone for the conservation of species \nand\u00a0habitats.\n\nThese protected areas must be made \n\u2032fit for climate change\u2032, so that they can \ncontinue to fulfil their function. This means \nthat existing pressures, for example due \nto intensive land use, such as high nutrient \nand pesticide inputs and disturbances \nof the water balance, must be reduced \nboth inside and outside protected areas. \nHowever, the resilience of protected areas \nmust also be enhanced through additional \n\npreventive measures, such as improved \nwater management within the area and at \nlandscape level.\n\nIn order to provide alternative habitats \nwith suitable (micro)climatic conditions \nfor sensitive species and to enable these \nspecies to reach these habitats, protected \nareas need to be enlarged to include a \nwider range of altitudes and exposures, \nand their connectivity needs to be \nimproved. Besides, protected areas must \nbe subject to adaptive management in \norder to be able to adjust protection goals \nto match the timing of climate changeinduced changes.\n\nIt is equally important to consider land \nuse as a whole. Forestry and agriculture \nhave to adjust their management concepts \nto mitigate the adverse effects of climate \nchange. For example, current silvicultural \nmanagement concepts, control instruments \nand planning approaches need to be \nrevised so that they can better meet \nthe challenges of climate change. More \nemphasis has to be put on enhancing the \nself-organising capacity of ecosystems, for \nexample by preventing the introduction \nof invasive alien species, using native \ntree species or applying close-to-nature \nmanagement concepts.\n\nLast but not least, there is need for a \nstronger focus on urban nature, for \nexample by building up networks of \nblue-green infrastructure to adapt to a \nchanging\u00a0climate.\n\f\n37\n\nBased on your experience, what \nkind of challenges do you see?\n\nAlthough climate protection currently is \ngaining political importance, we must not \nforget that climate mitigation, adaptation \nand biodiversity conservation issues must \nnot be set against each other.\n\nThe energy transition in Germany is a good \nexample of the opportunities but also the \nchallenges of simultaneously reducing \nenergy demand, developing renewable \nenergy sources and considering nature \nconservation aspects. We need to exploit \nthe synergies that arise from combined \nactions against climate change and \nbiodiversity loss.\n\nFor example, the protection and sustainable \nmanagement of forests and grassland \noffers both: ecosystem services such as \ncarbon storage and biomass for material \nand energetic production. If we focus \nunilaterally on short-term climate mitigation \nmeasures, such as maximising biomass \noutput for fossil energy substitution, we may \njeopardise the biodiversity of our forests \nand thereby probably reduce their capability \nto adapt to climate change.\n\nNature conservation and sustainable \nmanagement strategies need to better \ntake into account the dynamics and \nunpredictability of climate change and the \ncomplex responses of ecological systems \nto such changes. This means that nature \nconservation needs to move away from \n\nits traditional focus on the preservation \nand protection of rigid objects and must \nincreasingly allow dynamic processes and \npromote the resilience of ecosystems. In \nthe case of forestry, this entails moving \naway from the traditional, anticipatory \nmanagement paradigm towards a more \nprocess-oriented gradual and adaptive \nnature paradigm.\n\nAre there initiatives that \nhave succeeded in boosting \nnature\u2032s\u00a0resilience?\n\nVarious floodplain restoration projects \nhave been very successful in terms of \nstrengthening the resilience of ecosystems \nto the consequences of climate change, \nsuch as the large-scale nature conservation \nproject \u2032Mittlere Elbe\u2032 and the floodplain \nrestoration project on the Elbe in the area \n\u2032Hohe Garbe\u2032. Large floodplain areas were \nreconnected to the Elbe through a dyke \nrelocation or a dyke slit, and today they \nare once again subject to a near-natural \nflooding regime.\n\nNot only have these measures increased the \nflooding area and thus the retention area \nof the Elbe, which leads to a lowering of the \nwater head during flood events, but these \nhabitats have also become more resilient to \ndroughts and dry periods.\n\f\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 900 100\n\nRomania (173)\n\nGood Poor Bad Unknown\n\nState of nature in Europe: Habitats\n\nNote : The figure shows the conservation status of habitats at EU level.

From protected areas and green and \nblue infrastructure to restoration, rewilding and using nature-based solutions to climate \nchange, much needs to be done to reverse the deterioration in the health of nature.\n\nProtecting nature is the first step. Biodiversity \nin Europe continues to decline but there \nhave recently been positive developments \nfor forests, mammals and birds, which are \nbenefiting from conservation measures.\n\nCurrently, conservation efforts for more \nthan 2 000 species25 are covered by EU \nlegislation such as the Birds and the \nHabitats Directives26. At the heart of these \ndirectives is the EU\u2032s Natura 2000 network27 \nof protected areas, the largest of its kind in \nthe world. It makes up 18 % of the EU\u2032s land \narea and 8 % of its marine territory.\n\nSome of the most valuable and threatened \nspecies and habitats in Europe are protected \nby Natura 2000. Protected sites contain \nbreeding and resting places for rare and \nthreatened species, while some rare habitats \nare designated as sites in themselves.\n\nThe target of the new EU biodiversity \nstrategy28 is to increase the protected \narea to at least 30 % of EU land and 30\u00a0% \nof surrounding seas by 2030. Primary \nand old-growth forests and other \ncarbon-rich ecosystems, such as peatlands \nand grasslands, will be the focus of \nconservation\u00a0efforts.\n\nMoreover, the strategy calls for \nplanting at least 3 billion trees by \n2030 to support biodiversity and \necosystem restoration. More forests \nwill also be managed to promote \nbiodiversity-friendly practices.\n\nJoining the dots\n\nDeveloping the Trans-European Nature \nNetwork by enlarging protected areas \nto meet the 30 % target is part of the \nbiodiversity strategy. Many Natura 2000 \nprotected areas are already connected29 \nby natural and semi-natural landscapes \nthat provide ecosystem services, such \nas pollination, soil fertility, flood control \nand recreation, and are essential for \nclimate change mitigation and disaster \nrisk. The Emerald Network of Areas \nof Special Interest30, to which the EU \ncontributes via Natura 2000, also \nsupports the same efforts. Together, \nthese areas form a green infrastructure \nnetwork across Europe. Studies \nsuggest that nature is better protected \ninside this network, which contains a \ngreater area providing the required \nservices and experiencing fewer \necosystem\u00a0pressures.\n\f\n42\n\nHowever, barriers such as roads, railways, \nurban areas and agricultural land fragment \nthe landscape, limiting the movement \nof species and hindering the network\u2032s \ndevelopment. Increasing the connectivity \nof the network helps ensure that habitat \nconditions are improved, biodiversity decline \nis prevented and ecosystem service delivery \nis boosted.\n\nFree-flowing water\n\nBarriers hinder the health of Europe\u2032s water \nbodies. There are over 1 million barriers \non European rivers, including dams, weirs \nand sluices. Most are small and obsolete. \nThey contribute greatly to the poor state \nof nature in our rivers, as many species \nrequire rivers to be free-flowing to thrive \nand currently the movement downstream of \nsediment is prevented, causing blockages and \naltering\u00a0habitats.\n\nThe biodiversity strategy aims to restore at \nleast 25 000 km of free-flowing rivers by 2030 \nby removing barriers, constructing bypasses \nfor migrating fish and re-establishing the \nflow of sediment31. By October 2020, almost \n5 000 dam removals had been recorded in \nEurope, based on data from 11 countries32. \nRestoring floodplains and wetlands is also an \nimportant element of this work.\n\nCall of the wild\n\nWhile the above solutions require intensively \nmanaged processes to restore nature, \nrewilding is a newer, more natural approach. \nBy identifying spaces where natural \n\nprocesses are encouraged, it allows nature \nto heal so that it can start to manage on \nits own again. Initiatives such as Rewilding \nEurope33 are working to increase Europe\u2032s \nbiodiversity in this way.\n\nToday there are eight large rewilding \nareas in Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, \nPoland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden. \nThese are home to various rewilding \nprojects including the re-establishment \nof free-roaming populations of European \nbison34 in Romania\u2032s Southern Carpathians \nand the protection of the black and \ngriffon vultures35 in the Rhodope \nmountains in Bulgaria.\n\nChanging human-made systems\n\nThe EEA\u2032s landmark assessment of the \nstate of Europe\u2032s environment36 showed \nthat, in addition to conservation measures, \nwe need to fundamentally change the \nway we produce and consume food and \nenergy, how we develop and experience \nthe cities we live in and how we move \npeople and goods around.\n\nAgricultural activities and other land \nmanagement practices exert the \ngreatest pressure on nature, with the \nabandonment of grasslands having a \nparticularly big impact on pollinators, \nfarmland birds and semi-natural habitats. \nBy increasing organic farming by a quarter, \nreducing pesticide use by half by 2030 \nand restoring some agricultural land to \nhigh-diversity landscapes, we will help \nrestore\u00a0biodiversity.\n\f\n43\n\nUrban green spaces have been used more \nthan ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nProtection of such spaces is increasing, but \ngrey infrastructure still often dominates as \nurban populations grow. The biodiversity \nstrategy calls on citizens to develop urban \ngreening plans, and to create and connect \nurban parks, gardens, meadows and farms, \nas well as install green roofs and walls, and \nline streets with trees and hedges to allow \nbiodiversity to return. Plans should also aim \nto eliminate pesticides and, for example, \nestablish pollinator-friendly areas in cities.\n\nFinally, the European Commission has \npresented a zero pollution action plan37, \nTowards zero pollution for air, water \nand soil. Goals include a 50 % reduction \nin nutrient loss by reducing the run-off of \nnitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers, \nwhile protecting soil fertility. In addition, \nthe farm to fork strategy38 for a fair, \nhealthy and environmentally friendly \nfood system will also reduce the use \nof\u00a0pesticides.\n\nEurope\u2032s nature overseas\n\nThe EU\u2032s outermost regions and overseas countries and territories cover about the \nsame land area as the EU and the world\u2032s largest marine territories.\n\nThe EU\u2032s more than 150 overseas islands host more than 20 % of the world\u2032s coral reefs \nand lagoons and have a very rich biodiversity. However, these island ecosystems are \nalso highly vulnerable to invasive species, human activities and climate change impacts.\n\nThe BEST initiative39 \u2014 biodiversity and ecosystem services in territories of European \noverseas \u2014 aims to support the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of \necosystem services in the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories. \nCurrently, BEST projects support conservation efforts in EU territories around the world, \nfrom the Amazonia and Caribbean regions to the Macaronesia and Polar regions.\n\f\nEurope's Natura 2000 sites\n\nSource : NATURA 2000 - DG ENV, compiled from databases from the Member States.

We talked to James Vause, the \nlead economist at the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation \nMonitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), who contributed to the Dasgupta review on the \neconomics of biodiversity, especially to the chapter focused on trade and the biosphere.\n\nWhat would it take to halt \nbiodiversity loss \u2014 putting the \n\u2032right\u2032 economic value on nature?\n\nA cross-cutting understanding is essential \nfor effective action. This could be on \nunderstanding the role of nature in enabling \neconomic activity, the impact of economic \nactivity on biodiversity, the costs and \nbenefits of policy options to address those \nimpacts or assessing the multiple benefits \nof investments in nature. This is what we \ntry to do at UNEP-WCMC. Our work looks \nat, among other things, protected areas, \nagriculture, sustainable finance, tourism, \ntrade, infrastructure and the blue economy.\n\nWe recently published a paper40 looking \nat an enormous quantity of work that has \nbeen produced over the last few years. It all \npoints to the need to address the underlying \ndrivers of biodiversity loss outside the \nconservation sector.\u00a0We have to change the \nway we meet human needs and desires, to \nensure the world economy operates within \nthe constraints of the planet.\n\nThis might require making the economic \nvalue of nature much more visible and \nensuring that it is taken into account. But \nthis is just a part of it. As the Dasgupta \nreview highlighted, a big part of the problem \nis linked to an institutional failure\u00a0\u2014 how \nwe regulate economic and financial activity \nand also how we measure progress. \n\nWhat are the points you would \nlike to highlight from the \nDasgupta review?\n\nThe Dasgupta review41 does not shy away \nfrom the scale of the challenge we face. \nIt highlights that, if we are to increase the \nsupply of natural capital and reduce our \ndemands on the biosphere, large-scale \nchanges will be needed. These changes \nneed to be underpinned by levels of \nambition, coordination and political will \nat least as great as those of the Marshall \nplan launched after the Second World \nWar. It shows that we need engagement \nboth across governments and across \ninternational\u00a0boundaries.\n\f\n48\n\nIt flags the importance of education and \nmaking sure that we appreciate our place \nin nature, so that we are willing to take \nand sustain the action we need to. It also \nflags the role of the individual. We all \nmake decisions that impact on nature, so \nwe can be part of the change. I have, for \nexample, recently changed my bank and \npension plan. \n\nWhat kind of governance \nstructures do we \nneed to overcome this \n\u2032institutional\u00a0failure\u2032?\n\nWith our Cambridge Conservation \nInitiative partners, we are looking at \nthe type of governance that is needed \nto manage landscapes for multiple \nbenefits, including biodiversity. We can \nsee that there are different organisations \nwith different mandates and interests \nworking within different but overlapping \nadministrative boundaries, none of \nwhich tend to match up with ecological \nboundaries. There can even be an \ninternational dimension, for example \nif there are international trade and \ninvestment interests. How do we balance \ninternational interests with local people\u2032s \ngoals and national-level biodiversity \ntargets? It is a governance challenge.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum\u2032s \nNew Nature Economy42 work programme, \naround half of the world\u2032s gross \ndomestic product (GDP) is moderately \nor highly dependent upon nature, and \nthis dependency is not concentrated in \nthe world\u2032s big agricultural producing \ncountries because of global trade links.\n\n\u00a9 Chiara Bonvento, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\f\n49\n\nChanging how our economies relate to \nbiodiversity is not just about agreeing a good \npost-2020 framework in the Convention \non Biological Diversity but also about its \nuptake by other international institutions\u00a0\u2014 \nthe World Trade Organization in this case. \nFortunately, some progress is being made \nthere. For example, the Agreement on \nClimate Change, Trade and Sustainability \nis trying to establish how trade rules can \nsupport climate and sustainability goals.\n\nLike in all governance structures, it \nis essential to have an enforcement \nmechanism. Ultimately, this depends on \ncountries\u2032 and their leaders\u2032 commitment \nto allocating sufficient resources to address \nbiodiversity loss. Here, too, there are some \nencouraging developments, such as the \nEuropean Green Deal and the Leaders\u2032 \nPledge for Nature43 from the UN Biodiversity \nSummit 2020. However, as the Dasgupta \nreview highlights, we need coordinated \naction at an enormous scale. \n\nWhat kind of social inequalities \nare linked to biodiversity loss?\n\nFirst, there is impact inequality among \ncountries. Trade allows us to have places \nwhere the footprint of humankind outstrips \nthe local capacity of nature to supply \nthat footprint. Looking at this globally, it \nmeans that, through trade, richer countries \nare driving biodiversity loss around the \nworld. If we plot how countries perform \non the human development index against \ntheir ecological footprints, only very few \ncountries with high human development \nindex scores operate within an equal share \nof the world\u2032s biocapacity.\n\nThen there are differences within society. \nBuilding on the trade example above, if \nwe consider that the benefits of engaging \nin trade aren\u2032t necessarily captured by \nthe poorest in society, it paints a worrying \npicture. This is because the poorest in \nsociety are also likely to bear the greatest \ncosts of any biodiversity loss associated with \ntrade, as they rely most heavily on nature in \ntheir day-to-day lives.\n\nLastly, there is intergenerational inequality. \nHaving recently read David Attenborough\u2032s \n'A life on our planet', the intergenerational \npoint terrifies me. Our world is changing \nvery fast. An analysis done for the Dasgupta \nreview by the Natural History Museum and \nVivid Economics44 also highlighted that, if we \ndelay action on biodiversity by a decade, the \ncosts of stabilising biodiversity loss double \nand the chance of maintaining levels of \nbiodiversity similar to those we enjoy today \ndisappears. So the urgency of acting now is \nalso clearer than ever. \n\f\n50\n\nCan the UN\u2032s new accounting \nsystem be a game changer in the \nway we value nature?\n\nThe Dasgupta review suggests that we \nneed to move to measuring our wealth as \na measure of economic progress, rather \nthan our income or levels of activity as \ncaptured by GDP. It proposes that we \nmeasure our progress based on inclusive \nwealth, which includes natural capital. This \nidea is embedded in the UN\u2032s new system \nof environmental economic accounting\u00a0\u2014 \necosystem accounting (SEEA-EA), as a \ncrucial part of the natural capital stock are \nour ecosystems.\n\nWe are already seeing the impacts of \nthe new system in our work. The SEEAEA guidance has extended the reach of \nbiodiversity data. Rather than being of \ninterest to the environment ministry, data \nare now being collated and disseminated \nby offices of national statistics, which \nare then scrutinised by economic \nplanning departments, who are then \nadvocating policies to protect nature but \nfrom the perspective of socio-economic \nprogress.\u00a0It\u00a0is quite exciting and promising. \n\nAre you optimistic about our \nability to change the way we \nvalue and interact with nature?\n\nI think people do want change and do \nwant more from governments than words. \nI\u00a0also think COVID-19 has given us a bit of a \nwake-up call.\n\nIn the Dasgupta review, too, there is a \nfocus on the idea of socially embedded \npreferences, meaning that a person\u2032s \nbehaviour and practices are influenced by \nthe behaviour and practices of others. This \noffers hope that widespread behaviour \nchange could be possible, and at lower \ncost than we might expect if people \nlike to conform. The current fashion for \nmore plant-dominated diets could be a \ngood\u00a0example.\n\n\u00a9 Gabriella Motta, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA \n\f\n\u00a9 Gabriella Motta, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA 51\n\f\nGood Poor Bad UnknownGood Poor Bad Unknown\n\n5\n\nRomania (621)\n\nState of nature in Europe: Other species\n\nNote : Statistics are based on the number of EU species assessments (2 825).

To this day, the nature directives \u2014 the Birds Directive \nand the Habitats Directive, first adopted in 1979 and 1992, respectively\u00a0\u2014\u00a0constitute the \ncornerstone of the EU\u2032s efforts to protect and preserve biodiversity.\n\nThe two directives put many species and \nhabitats under a common protection \nscheme with regular monitoring \nand reporting requirements. The \ndegradation documented thanks to these \ndirectives calls for more extensive and \ncoordinated action across many policy \ndomains in Europe and\u00a0globally.\n\nToday, the EU has one of the most \ncomprehensive sets of environment and \nclimate legislation in the world. Some \nEU laws tackle pollutant or greenhouse \ngas emissions, pollution levels in the \nair or water, or emissions from specific \nsources, such as industry or transport.\n\nSome EU nature legislation, such as \nthe EU Pollinators Initiative45, call for \ntargeted action. Others, the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD)46 and the \nMarine Strategy Framework Directive \n(MSFD)47 in particular, play a central \nrole in protecting nature through \necosystem-based management. The \nWFD requires Member States to achieve \n\u2032good status\u2032 for all water bodies (lakes, \n\nrivers and groundwater) through sustainable \nand coordinated management of entire \nriver\u00a0basins.\n\nSimilarly, the MSFD calls for good \nenvironmental status in the marine \nenvironment, tackling pressures and \npollution. Nature-related legislation is \nsupported by, among other things, circular \neconomy legislation aimed at reducing \nwaste and contamination risks, for example \nthrough better waste management, \nimproved eco-design and limiting \nsingle-use\u00a0plastics.\n\nThese laws help EU Member States enjoy \ncleaner air, shift towards cleaner energy, \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nplace an increasing share of their land and \nmarine areas under protection, including \nthrough the Natura 2000 network48. The \nEU green infrastructure connects more \nand more natural spaces, allowing wildlife \nto move between them. Cities are planning \ngreen and blue spaces as a way to prepare \nfor climate change impacts and help \npreserve\u00a0biodiversity.\n\f\n56 \u00a9 Michaela Vinterov\u00e1, REDISCOVER Nature/EEA\n\nThe European Green Deal49 outlines the EU\u2032s \nlong-term ambition of becoming the first \nclimate-neutral continent with a sustainable \neconomy by 2050 and is implemented \nthrough key policy instruments such as the \nEU biodiversity strategy for 203050, the \nfarm to fork strategy51, the EU strategy \non adaptation to climate change52 and \nthe new EU forest strategy for 203053. \nIt is also supported by others, including \nthe circular economy action plan54, the \nchemicals strategy55 and the zero pollution \naction\u00a0plan56.\n\nTo reduce pressures on nature, halt the \ndecline and restore biodiversity, Europe \nwill need to act on all fronts, transform its \nenergy, food and mobility systems, and do \nso with global partners. \n\nEEA\u2032s information systems on \nnature\n\nBISE \u2014 Biodiversity Information \nSystem for Europe57: the key source \nof data and information about \nbiodiversity in Europe.\n\nFISE \u2014 Forest Information System for \nEurope58: an entry point for sharing \ninformation with the forest community \non Europe\u2032s forest environment, its \nstate and development.\n\nWISE \u2014 Water Information System for \nEurope59: the European information \ngateway to water issues.

Still, we regret the lack of \n\nadjustment applied to the core budget, to fully reflect the increased costs, which limit the future \n\nopportunities, for example in relation to the European Topic Centres. The Scientific Committee \n\nfully endorses the requests made for additional resources for any new tasks delegated to the \n\nAgency. The current situation still undercuts the Agency\u2019s capacity to engage in numerous \n\nimportant activities, including engaging sufficiently with the wider global community on global \n\nenvironmental concerns and challenges. \n\nFollowing the adoption of the novel EEA/EIONET strategy by the EEA Management Board in \n\nDecember 2020, there are now five distinct work areas; Biodiversity and ecosystems; Climate \n\nchange mitigation and adaptation; Human health and the environment; Circular economy and \n\nresource use; Sustainability trends, prospects and responses.   \n\nWhile each of these work areas will be reflected in the new European Topic Centres that will \n\nbecome operational from 2022, the SPD could provide more substantial insights into how the \n\nvisions described in the strategy are being operationalized into short term objectives and \n\noutputs, and what is to be considered the responsibilities of the new Topic Centres vis-\u00e0-vis \n\nthe EEA itself. As a major shortcoming of the draft SPD, many AWP-2022 activities of the work \n\nareas are described in rather generic terms, so that frequently it remains unclear what \n\nspecifically is the aim for the coming year. Some work areas are described better than others. \n\nMoreover, the Scientific Committee would have liked \u2013 under activity area 5 on \u2018sustainability \n\ntrends, prospects and response\u2019 \u2013 to see more Agency efforts devoted to behavioral aspects, \n\f\nbeyond SOER and beyond simply providing support to the Commission. Activity area 1 on \n\nbiodiversity deserves more operational clarity in relation to the strategy. Finally, we miss \n\ncoverage of the European Topic Centres in the SPD. \n\nThe Scientific Committee recommends highlighting the key reports or comparable outputs that \n\nwill be produced during the coming year, as is done now only in a few instances. It also seems \n\nthat all \u2018activity areas\u2019 (why not \u2018work areas\u2019 as in the strategy?) should relate to all five \n\nstrategic objectives of the strategy, and should indicate how they will be operationalized into \n\nactivities during the coming year. It is suggested that the sections \u2018activity description\u2019 could \n\nmore logically follow the \u2018changing strategic context\u2019 sections, which is more than an editorial \n\ncomment, since we consider it to be rather essential that the EEA places its activities in \n\ncontext.  \n\nOverall, the Scientific Committee encourages the EEA to reflect a higher level of ambition in \n\nthe programming of activities. Although the EEA obviously has tied many resources and efforts \n\ninto routine activities of monitoring and reporting, there are emerging demands from the \n\nchanging contexts that cannot be ignored. We find it important that the EEA dedicates some \n\nresources and attention to these purposes, to enable qualified and timely input.  \n\nOne example relates to the emerging demands in the context of the European Commission\u2019s \n\nFarm-to-fork strategy and the next phase of the Common Agricultural Policy, both of which will \n\nrequire the use and availability of robust environmental indicators of environmental pressures \n\nand the protection of biodiversity for the future allocation and spending of EU funds. We \n\nencourage the EEA, as part of its activities, to begin identifying what data and assessments \n\nare available and what would be needed. Another example relates to the implementation of \n\nthe EU\u2019s research and innovation missions, where the Agency is well placed to contribute. The \n\ninvolvement of the EEA in drafting the EU\u2019s sustainable finance taxonomy serves as an \n\nexcellent example of what can be accomplished by a timely and proactive response to \n\nemerging demands. \n\nWe congratulate the EEA for the PD2022-2024 with AWP2022 and look forward to supporting \n\nthe EEA during its implementation.  \n\n \n\nCopenhagen, 27 May 2021 \n\nSIGNED \n\nProf. Per Mickwitz, Chair of EEA Scientific Committee"]}
