{"query": "How many people are exposed to air pollution?", "texts": ["Almost all Europeans who live in cities are exposed to air pollution that exceeds the levels set in the\r\nWorld Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) guidelines for clean air. Air pollution is the greatest environmental\r\nhealth hazard in Europe and globally.", "Urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above selected EU air quality standards, EU-27 and the UK. Source: EEA, Exceedance of air quality standards in Europe\nAir pollution emissions have been generally decreasing in Europe. However, exposure to air pollution is seen as the most important environmental risk to human health of the European population (WHO, 2016). Europe\u2019s most serious pollutants, in terms of harm to human health, are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3).\nExposure to air pollutants leads to a wide range of diseases, including stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, aggravated asthma and lower respiratory infections. There is also evidence of links between exposure to air pollution and type 2 diabetes, obesity, systemic inflammation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. For more information see: Air pollution: how it affects our health.\nAlthough air pollution affects the whole population, certain groups are more likely to suffer from exposure to it. This includes children, elderly, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing health problems. In large parts of Europe, lower-income groups are more likely to face higher exposure to air pollution live next to busy roads or industrial areas (EEA, 2018).\nIn 2019, approximately 307 000 premature deaths in EU-27 were attributable to long-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM2.5). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was linked to 40 400 premature deaths, and ground-level ozone (O3) to 16 800 premature deaths (EEA, 2021).\nIn recent years, the share of the urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above EU limit values, and the resulting health impact, has been decreasing for PM2.5 and NO2 (see figure above). For ground-level ozone, the northern hemispheric background concentration is increasing in Europe, while global peak values are decreasing (Andersson et al., 2017; Orru et al., 2019; Paoletti et al., 2014).\nThere is increasing evidence that negative health effects of air pollution occur also below the EU ambient air quality directive levels, and this is reflected in the new WHO global air quality guidelines (WHO, 2021). As the updated WHO guidelines are stricter for most pollutants, the share of the urban population exposed to unhealthy air pollutant concentrations and the associated health impact will be larger than previous estimates.\nChanges in temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, or solar radiation associated with climate change affect air quality, potentially worsening it (Fu and Tian, 2019). This happens via altered emissions from natural sources (such as wildfires, mineral dust, sea salt, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC)); emissions from human sources (such as ammonia from agriculture); rates of chemical reactions in the atmosphere; and transport, dispersion and deposition processes of air pollutants (Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017; Geels et al., 2015).\nIn relation to human health, the combination of heat stress and air pollution is particularly damaging. Simultanous exposure of population to high temperatures and air pollution (PM, NO2 or O3) has been linked to increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes (EEA, 2020). The ongoing and projected demographic changes, such as an aging population with increasing prevalence of underlying health problems, will also contribute to an increase of the burden of disease related to air pollution.\nParticulate matter concentrations in the air are projected to increase slightly in the future, albeit with some uncertainty (Doherty et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020). This is because climate change has an impact on the emissions of the precursors of PM: the number and severity of naturally occurring wildfires is expected to increase, as are sea salt emissions. Further, higher temperatures increase biogenic and agricultural ammonia emissions (Geels et al., 2015). Also, the chemical reactions leading to the production of secondary PM are intensified by temperature and humidity changes (Megaritis et al., 2014). Finally, decreases in wind speed, for example projected for parts of the Mediterranean region (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), and decreasing precipitation will reduce the dilution and deposition of PM, resulting in higher air concentration levels (Doherty et al., 2017).\nUnder the changing climate, higher ground-level O3 concentrations are projected during summer, with the largest increase predicted for the warmest scenarios and for Southern and Central Europe (Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017; Colette et al., 2015). The peak concentrations are projected to increase, which is relevant for health impacts, as short-term exposure to high peak concentrations of ground-level ozone is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular health problems (Doherty et al., 2017). Up to an 11% increase in ground-level ozone-associated mortality is expected in some countries in Central and Southern Europe in 2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario (Orru et al., 2019).\nGround-level ozone is formed in the atmosphere by photochemical reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. Under climate change, BVOC emissions are likely to increase due to a higher number of hot days; increasing atmospheric CO2 levels may also influence the production of BVOC (Fu and Tian, 2019). Increased global methane concentrations and higher temperatures also accelerate ground-level O3 production. Further, the expected greater influx of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere is projected to raise the ground-level ozone levels further across Europe (Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017).\nNO2 concentration levels are not expected to be influenced by climate change.\nHigh levels of humidity and flooding of buildings can support the growth of moulds and increase the prevalence of respiratory diseases (D\u2019Amato et al., 2020). Further, in urban areas air pollution (in particular long-term high NO2 levels) may increase the allergenicity of pollen (Gisler, 2021; Plaza et al., 2020), the concentration and seasonality of which is affected itself by the changing climate.\nThe revised WHO global air quality guidelines form a solid scientific evidence base for making decisions on clean air policy worldwide. Within the framework of the European Green Deal, the European Union is revising its Ambient Air Directives to align them more closely with the new WHO guidelines. Mitigation measures for reducing CO2 emissions often have a positive effect on the emissions of air pollutants from traffic, energy production, domestic heating, etc., creating a win-win situation.\nAir quality assessments, including health impact, are performed at an annual basis by different authorities. Forecast and early warning systems for air pollution, together with medical advice, can reduce the health risks. They can also be used by healthcare systems to prepare for higher numbers of patients in emergency departments. Forecast and early warning systems are operational at the local level as well as at regional scales, such as e.g. the EEA\u2019s European Air Quality Index. In several European countries ozone concentration levels are included in heat-health action plans.\nCitizen science projects on air quality provide evidence-based information and create awareness amongst citizens.\nAndersson, C. et al.

You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.\nIn the EEA\u2019s new city air quality viewer, cities are ranked from the cleanest city to the most polluted, on the basis of average levels of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, over the past two calendar years.\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the top three cleanest cities in Europe in terms of air quality were Ume\u00e5 in Sweden, Tampere in Finland and Funchal in Portugal. The three most polluted were Nowy Sacz in Poland, Cremona in Italy and Slavonski Brod in Croatia.\nOf the 323 cities included in the viewer, air quality in 127 cities is categorised as good, meaning that it falls below the health-based guideline for long-term exposure to PM2.5 of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 \u03bcg/m3) established by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe European Union has set an annual limit value for PM2.5 of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe. The viewer rates the long-term air quality as very poor when PM2.5 levels are at or above this threshold, with five cities in Poland, Croatia and Italy falling in this category.\nFine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. The viewer provides information on long term air quality in each city. Long term exposure to PM2.5 causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\nWhile there has been a marked improvement in Europe's air quality over the past decade, the EEA\u2019s latest annual air quality assessment found that exposure to fine particulate mater caused about 417,000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2018.\nWhile air quality has improved markedly over the past years, air pollution remains stubbornly high in many cities across Europe. This city air quality viewer allows citizens to see for themselves in an easy-to-use way how their city is doing compared to others on air pollution.\nIt provides concrete and local information which can empower citizens towards their local authorities to address the issues. This will help all of us in achieving the EU\u2019s zero pollution goals.\nHans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director\nThe viewer provides data on the levels of fine particulate matter in over 300 cities across EEA member countries. It uses data reported to the EEA by its member countries under the EU\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Directives. Data comes from ground measurements of PM2.5 taken by over 400 monitoring stations taken in urban and suburban areas within cities. These stations provide a robust picture of the exposure of the population to air pollution.\nReadings and rankings are based on a the annual mean PM2.5 concentration over the past two calendar years, using up-to-date data for the most recent year and validated air quality data for the year before last. The table ranks European cities according to their average levels of fine particulate matter over the past two full calendar years. The EEA will in the future investigate incorporating other important air pollutants into the new tool.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has established a health-based guideline for long-term exposure to fine particulate matter of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 \u03bcg/m3). The European Union has set an annual limit value for fine particulate matter of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe.\nThe viewer rates levels of air quality as:\nPlease note that not all cities are included. The data set includes cities that are part of the European Commission\u2019s Urban Audit and that have a population of over 50,000 inhabitants. Cities that do not have urban or suburban monitoring stations are not included, nor are those for which data from these monitoring stations covers less than 75% of days within a calendar year.\nIf you want to know what the air quality is in your city right now, please visit the European Air Quality Index. The index presents information on air quality over the past two days and a 24-hour forecast, together with health-based recommendations for short term exposure to air pollution. It also covers a broader range of air pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone.\nMore information on the health impacts of air pollution in Europe is available here.\nSee here for the European Environment Agency\u2019s latest annual report on air quality in Europe.\n2019-2020\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-european-city-air-quality or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 01:27 PM\nFiled under: environment and health urban air quality air quality air pollution\nFiled under: environment and health, urban air quality, air quality, air pollution\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Exposure to these concentrations can lead to major health problems.\nUpdated information on Europe's air quality and air pollutant emissions\nAccording to the European Environment Agency\u2019s 2019 Air Quality Report, cities regularly exceed the European air quality standards for PM2.5 levels prescribed by the Air Quality Directives and by the Air Quality Guidelines recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nKey messages:\n- A total of 8 % of the EU-28 urban population are exposed to PM2.5 concentrations that exceed the EU limit value. Moreover, 77 % of the EU-28 urban population is exposed to PM2.5 concentrations above the WHO Air Quality Guidelines value.\n- The European cities with the highest levels of PM2.5 air pollution are in Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Poland, Croatia and Czechia.\n- PM2.5 is mostly generated through the combustion of fossil fuels and by agricultural activities.\nPM2.5 concentrations are partly created by chemical reactions involving NOx emissions. It is estimated that, in 2017, about 8 % of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to concentrations that exceeded the EU annual average limit value (25 \u00b5g/m3) and 77% were exposed to concentrations that exceeded the equivalent and more stringent WHO Air Quality Guidelines (10 \u00b5g/m3).\nSource: Air quality in Europe 2019\nIn the EEA\u2019s 2019 Annual Air Quality Report, the information provided on urban air pollution is based on the average of the urban and suburban background concentrations of PM2.5 measured. Initially, stations in the EEA air-quality database are spatially joined with Urban Audit greater cities in a geographical information system, in order to select those monitoring stations that fall within the boundaries of the cities included in the Urban Audit collection. The analysis is based on annual statistics of the 2017 measurement data reported by EEA Member countries in 2019 and stored in the EEA Air Quality e-reporting database.\nThe above Figure 1 shows the level of air pollution in terms of the concentrations of PM2.5 in the most polluted, least polluted and most populated cities. Data are given for each country, as well as the average concentration for all cities in each country. For each city, all the urban and suburban background stations for which more than 75 % of data are valid for the relevant pollutant have been considered. Countries are ranked by the average increasing value of the cities. The figure in brackets after the country indicates the number of cities considered.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/urban-air-quality/urban-air-quality or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 01:43 PM\nFiled under: urban\nFiled under: urban\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Air pollution experts from the UK modelled which types of green infrastructure can help reduce temperatures in many of Europe's cities and towns.

A briefing by the European Environment Agency, published today, presents an overview of these chemicals, which continue to accumulate in people and the environment.\nThe EEA briefing \u2018Emerging chemical risks in Europe \u2014 PFAS\u2019 presents an overview of the known and potential risks to human health and the environment in Europe posed by per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). These extremely persistent and man-made chemicals are used in a variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique properties, for example, to increase oil and water repellence, reduce surface tension, or resist high temperatures and chemicals. Currently more than 4 700 different PFAS exist, which, due to their extreme persistence, accumulate in people and the environment.\nAlthough there is a lack of systematic mapping and monitoring of potentially polluted sites in Europe, national monitoring activities have detected PFAS in the environment across Europe, and the production and use of PFAS have also resulted in the contamination of drinking water supplies in several European countries. Human biomonitoring has also detected a range of PFAS in the blood of European citizens.\nThe EEA briefing warns that, due to the large number of PFAS, it is a difficult and time-consuming task to assess and manage risks for these substances individually, which may lead to widespread and irreversible pollution. The costs to society due to harm to human health and remediation in Europe have been estimated to be tens of billions of EUR annually. People are mainly exposed to PFAS through drinking water, food and food packaging, dust, creams and cosmetics, PFAS-coated textiles or other consumer products. Taking precautionary actions to limit non-essential uses and promoting the use of chemicals that are \u2018safe-and-circular-by-design\u2019 could help limit future pollution, the briefing notes.\nThe European Commission published yesterday its communication on the European Green Deal, which includes a zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment. The Commission\u2019s communication foresees a chemicals strategy for sustainability that \u201cwill both help to protect citizens and the environment better against hazardous chemicals and encourage innovation for the development of safe and sustainable alternatives.\u201d The communication also states that \u201cthe regulatory framework will need to rapidly reflect scientific evidence on the risk posed by endocrine disruptors, hazardous chemicals in products including imports, combination effects of different chemicals and very persistent chemicals.\u201d\n2019\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/pfas-pollution-is-widespread-in or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 01:35 PM\nFiled under: environment and health chemicals chemical pollution pfas\nFiled under: environment and health, chemicals, chemical pollution, pfas\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Exceedance of air quality standards in Europe\nEU legislation has led to improvements in air quality, with the percentage of urban citizens exposed to pollutant levels above standards set to protect human health falling between 2000 and 2019. However, poor air quality remains a problem: in 2019, 21 % of citizens were exposed to O3 and 10 % to PM10 levels above EU standards. This is mainly because of emissions from transport and buildings, but also from agriculture and industry. Without radical changes to mobility, energy and food systems and industry, it is unlikely that air quality targets will be met in the near future.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||PM2.5||PM10||O3||NO2||BaP||SO2|\n|2000||52.6||25||25.8|\n|2001||38.9||42.1||21|\n|2002||40||26.9||22.5|\n|2003||46.9||63.9||31.9|\n|2004||33.3||22.9||19.2|\n|2005||40.6||28.3||20.1|\n|2006||20.4||45.3||54.9||16|\n|2007||13.7||33.2||26.1||19.8|\n|2008||15.1||26||18.4||11.3|\n|2009||11.5||26.7||19.8||12.9|\n|2010||13.3||27.9||21.3||9.6|\n|2011||17.6||33.5||19.8||10.3|\n|2012||13.8||25||18.9||7.5|\n|2013||8.7||21.5||17.4||9.4|\n|2014||8.2||16.4||7.3||8.1|\n|2015||7.2||22.7||29.4||8.4|\n|2016||5.5||12.9||12||7.1|\n|2017||7.8||16.8||16.5||6.4|\n|2018||3.8||14.8||34.2||3.5|\n|2019||1||9.8||20.6||3.3|\nMore than 70 % of EU citizens live in urban areas, where high population densities and economic activities cause high levels of air pollution. Such exposure is linked to adverse health effects, such as respiratory and heart problems, and cancer. Particulate matter (PM), O3, NO2 and SO2 are associated with serious health problems. The EU Air Quality Directive aims to protect health, vegetation and natural ecosystems by setting limit and target values for air pollutants (and long-term objectives for O3). The Clean Air Programme, published in 2013, aims to comply with this legislation by the time 2020 data are available.\nFor most pollutants, there is progress, with the percentage of people exposed to levels above EU standards decreasing since 2000. However, potentially harmful levels are still recorded in many areas. For instance, although substantially lower than the 47 % peak in 2003, in 2019, 10 % of urban citizens were still exposed to PM with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m or less (PM10) above the EU daily limit value.\nExposure to harmful levels of fine PM (PM2.5) and NO2 is less common, but 3 % of the urban population lived in zones exceeding the EU limit values for NO2 and only 1% in urban areas exceeding the EU limit values for PM2.5 in 2019. For SO2, the percentage exposed to levels above the limit value decreased between 2000 and 2019, to less than 0.1 % in the last 10 years (with a maximum of 3% in 2006). Therefore, these values are also not exhibited in Figure 1.\nO3 is a secondary pollutant formed from other pollutants in the presence of solar light. Its levels are determined by emissions and climatic conditions. The proportion of the population exposed to O3 above EU target levels has fluctuated from a 64 % peak in 2003 to 7 % in 2014. Since this low value, however, Europe has seen the two warmest years on record \u2014 2015 and 2018 \u2014 resulting in 30 % or more of the population being exposed to O3 above the target value. However, in 2019, this ratio decreased to 21%.\nAs there are relatively few reported measurements of BaP and these were not considered to be homogeneous across Europe until 2008, the values are not presented in the Figure 1. Considering data reported after that year, the portion of the urban population exposed to concentrations above the BaP target value has shown little variation within the range of 14-17 % in 2017-2019.\nDespite progress driven by EU policies to reduce emissions and protect citizens from pollutants, addressing the causes of poor air quality remains a challenge. Given the widespread exceedance of EU limit and target values in urban areas, the EU is not on track to meet air quality standards by 2020. Substantial efforts in relation to agriculture and energy use for transport and in buildings are needed to improve air quality and advance EU progress towards meeting climate change policy objectives.\n|Year||PM2.5||PM10||O3||NO2||BaP||SO2|\n|2000||86.8||95.5||25.8|\n|2001||83.2||97||21|\n|2002||80.8||99.7||22.5|\n|2003||89.8||95||31.9|\n|2004||77.5||99.7||19.2|\n|2005||81.7||97.9||20.1|\n|2006||96.9||84||99.8||16|\n|2007||89.1||87.3||98.7||19.8|\n|2008||85.3||78.1||98.3||11.3|\n|2009||89.7||84.1||99.4||12.9|\n|2010||89.8||83.9||98.9||9.6|\n|2011||92.3||86.5||97||10.3|\n|2012||89.9||72.5||97.8||7.5|\n|2013||86.3||62.1||98||9.4|\n|2014||86.5||50.3||95.9||8.1|\n|2015||81.5||53.6||95.9||8.4|\n|2016||74.6||42.1||98||7.1|\n|2017||77.3||45||96.3||6.4|\n|2018||73.5||48||99||3.5|\n|2019||60.9||35.8||98.3||3.3|\nThe EU Clean Air Programme set the long-term objective of complying with WHO air quality guidelines, which are much stricter than the standards set by the EU Air Quality Directive and are based on what is considered necessary to ensure the protection of human health. The European Green Dealproposes to revise the EU air quality standards to align them more closely with the World Health Organization recommendations. The WHO published new air quality guidelines in 2021, nevertheless the analysis in this indicator considers still the 2005 version.\nAs there are relatively few reported measurements of BaP and these were not considered to be homogeneous across Europe until 2008, the values are not presented in the Figure 2. When considering the estimated 'reference level' for BaP, the portion of the population exposed is much higher (84-91 % for 2008-2016 and 71-83 % for 2017-2019) and almost constant over the period.\nThe results for SO2 show that the portion of the urban population exposed to concentrations above daily WHO guidelines \u2013 which decreased steadily from a maximum of 84 % in 2000 \u2013 reached a minimum of 10% in 2015 and remained within the range of 17-30% for the period 2017-2019. Therefore, these values are also not displayed in Figure 2.\nOverall, progress has been made, with the proportion of the EU urban population exposed to PM, NO2 and SO2 above 2005 WHO guideline values decreasing since 2000. However, the EU is a long way from reaching its goal of complete compliance with the WHO\u2019s air quality guidelines. In 2019, 36 % of the EU urban population was estimated to be exposed to PM10 above the WHO guideline value, 61% to PM2.5, 3% to NO2 and 17% to SO2. The situation is even worse for O3: the proportion of the population exposed to O3 above the 2005 WHO guideline value fluctuated between 95 % and 100 % in the period 2000-2019, with no decreasing trend over time.\nFor the urban population exposed to concentrations both above EU standards and 2005 WHO air quality guidelines at country level, please see the EEA data viewer."]}
