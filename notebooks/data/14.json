Between 2010 and 2019, emission intensity decreased by 4.3%, mostly due to the increased use of biofuels. Finland and Sweden are the only Member States whose emission intensities decreased by more than 6%, with the Netherlands reporting a 5.8% reduction in 2019. If the indirect land use change (ILUC) effects of biofuel production are considered, the emission intensity of fuels sold in the EU also decreased between 2018 and 2019, due to the limited substitution of oil crops as feedstocks by sugars.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\nTransport is responsible for more than 25 % of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a major contributor to climate change. Cutting emissions from transport is pivotal to achieving the EU target of becoming climate neutral by 2050.\nTo support a reduction in GHG emissions from transport, the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) sets the target that fuel suppliers should reduce the emission intensity of fuels sold in the EU by 6 % by 2020, compared with 2010. In 2017, the average emission intensity of fuels in the EU was 3.4 % lower than in 2010, thus failing to meet the indicative target of a 4 % reduction by 2017. In 2018, the average emission intensity of fuels in the EU was 3.7% lower than in 2010, and in 2019, a 4.3% reduction had been achieved. Despite the improvement, as of 2019, the EU was not on track to meet its 2020 target.\nThe decrease in emission intensity of road transport fuels between 2018 and 2019 can be attributed mainly to an increase (from 5.2% to 5.6%) in the proportion of biofuels used, as biofuels have a lower emission intensity than fossil fuels. Also, there was a decrease in the emission intensity of the biofuels used between 2018 and 2019, because of a small decrease in the use of oil crops, which generally have a higher emission intensity than other feedstocks in biofuel production.\nBiofuel use has contributed to a reduction in the GHG emission intensity of road transport in the EU. However, it is important to ensure that rising demand for biofuels does not have a negative impact on land use by displacing the production of food and feed crops and driving the conversion of land \u2014 such as forests and wetlands \u2014 to agricultural land, leading indirectly to increased GHG emissions. This phenomenon is known as indirect land us change (ILUC). The FQD requires that Member States identify the feedstock from which their biofuels originate and estimate emissions resulting from ILUC for certain feedstocks.\nHowever, emissions from ILUC are not considered for assessing compliance with the 6% 2020 reduction target. If ILUC is taken into account, the average GHG emission intensity of fuels consumed in 2019 is only 2.6% lower than in 2010; it decreased between 2018 and 2019 because of the decreased use of oils crops substituted by sugars.\n|Countries||2010-2019 GHG intensity reduction (excl. indirect land use change)||2010-2019 GHG intensity reduction (incl. indirect land use change)||2020 target|\n|Austria||3.2||0.1||6|\n|Belgium||3||0.6||6|\n|Bulgaria||3.7||1.4||6|\n|Croatia||2.5||1.6||6|\n|Cyprus||1.3||1.3||6|\n|Czechia||3.8||1.9||6|\n|Denmark||2.7||0.6||6|\n|Estonia||1.8||1.3||6|\n|Finland||7.7||7.5||6|\n|France||4.5||1||6|\n|Germany||3.8||2.3||6|\n|Greece||3.5||2.2||6|\n|Hungary||3||2.5||6|\n|Ireland||3.5||3.4||6|\n|Italy||3.8||3.3||6|\n|Latvia||1.8||0.5||6|\n|Lithuania||2.2||0.5||6|\n|Luxembourg||3.4||1.1||6|\n|Malta||4.3||4.2||6|\n|Netherlands||5.8||5.6||6|\n|Poland||4.2||1.6||6|\n|Portugal||3.1||2.1||6|\n|Romania||2.8||0.5||6|\n|Slovakia||4||1.7||6|\n|Slovenia||2.9||1.7||6|\n|Spain||3.4||1.2||6|\n|Sweden||18.6||15.2||6|\n|United Kingdom||4.4||4.2||6|\n|EU-27 + UK||4.3||2.6||6|\nProgress towards meeting the 6% reduction target by 2020 varies widely across Member States. In 2019, Finland and Sweden had exceeded this target and the Netherlands was close to reaching it (5.8% reduction). This is because their road transport fuel mixes have relatively high proportions of biofuels (9% in Finland, 7% in the Netherlands and 22% in Sweden) and, on average, the biofuels used have relatively low emission intensities (10.4 g CO2e/MJ, 15.2 g CO2e/MJ and 14.1 g CO2e/MJ, respectively).\nThe three Member States that reduced their emission intensities the least between 2010 and 2019, namely Cyprus (1.4%), Latvia (1.8%) and Estonia (1.8%), use fuel mixes with much lower proportions of biofuels (1.7% in Cyprus, 2.6% in Latvia and 2.8% in Estonia) and, in the case of Latvia, the biofuels used have much higher emission intensities (32 gCO2e/MJ).\nThe effect that ILUC has on reductions in Member States\u2019 emission intensities largely depends on the feedstocks used to produce biofuels. Oil crops are used extensively in several Member States, such as Austria (89%) and Lithuania (83%) and, if ILUC effects are considered, the GHG emission intensity of these biofuels increases and is therefore getting closer to the GHG emission intensity of diesel produced from fossil fuels (i.e. for Austria from 32 gCO2e/MJ excluding ILUC to 83 gCO2e/MJ including ILUC).", "Greenhouse gas emission intensity of fuels and biofuels for road transport in Europe\nIn 2019, the EU was not on track to meet its target to reduce the greenhouse gas emission intensity of fuels sold for road transport to 6% below 2010 levels by 2020.

This overshoot was propelled by steep emission cuts in 2019 and 2020. While the cut in 2019 was strongly driven by fossil fuel price effects and policy measures, the decline in 2020 was additionally related to the Covid-19 pandemic. EU greenhouse gas emissions are expected to further decline until 2030. Member States have not yet realigned their ambitions to the new net 55% reduction target for 2030, and the further implementation of impactful policies and measures will be important to bring the new 2030 target within reach.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\nThe EU markedly surpassed its 2020 emissions reduction target of 20%. According to recent estimates, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU Member States were 31% lower in 2020 than they were in 1990, exceeding the EU\u2019s climate target by 11 percentage points. With one exception in 2017, the EU\u2019s GHG emissions were below the 2020 reduction target for the past 7 years, with the rapid decline in emissions observed in the last 2 years contributing significantly to this overshoot. These achievements include emissions from international aviation and do not account for land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) contributions.\nThe emissions decrease in 2020 compared with the previous year was 10% \u2014 making it the second year in a row with the steepest annual reduction seen in the last decade. The remarkable reduction of 4% achieved in 2019 was strongly driven by policy measures such as the substitution of coal by gas and renewable energy sources for power generation. The circumstances in 2020 were much different from 2019 and decreasing emissions caused by reduced energy use from economic activities and transport were largely related to the effects of the measures addressing the Covid-19 pandemic. The extent to which climate change mitigation measures also contributed to the decline in 2020 is currently unclear.\nLooking towards climate mitigation targets for 2030, the EU\u2019s total GHG emissions[1] are expected to continue declining to a net emissions reduction of 41%. Most Member States have not yet realigned their ambitions to the new net 55% reduction target for 2030, and the further introduction of more impactful policies and measures across Europe will be necessary to bring the new 2030 target within reach.\nThe EU\u2019s aim to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 will require a realistic and resilient emissions pathway into the future. The agreement and subsequent implementation of the EU policy proposals addressing the EU's ambitious 2030 and 2050 targets (compared with 1990 and including removals) is therefore fundamental to keep bending the emission trend while recovering from the pandemic.\n[1] Greenhouse gas projections submitted by Germany are preliminary.\nThree key EU policies address GHG emissions and removals: the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS); the Effort Sharing legislation; and the legislation on emissions and removals from LULUCF.\nThe ETS covers large power stations, large industrial plants, large district heating plants and aviation, representing about 40% of total EU emissions. Emissions have decreased by 41% since 2005, driven by the decarbonisation of the EU power sector. A particularly significant annual emissions reduction of 12% took place in 2020, strongly related to measures curbing the Covid-19 pandemic.\nNational GHG reduction targets are governed by the Effort Sharing legislation. The national targets cover sectors such as transport, buildings, non-ETS industry, agriculture and waste. Emissions have fallen by 15% since 2005, much less than the reductions seen in ETS emissions, reflecting higher abatement costs. There was a strong decrease of 6% between 2019 and 2020, which can be largely ascribed to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBy 2030, EU projections submitted by Member States point to a 29% reduction in Effort Sharing emissions compared with 2005 levels and a 47% reduction for ETS emissions compared with 2005 levels (not taking into account the new targets for 2030 and 2050 and the EU\u2019s \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 policy proposals to address them).\nThe LULUCF sector at EU level represents a net carbon sink of about 249 Mt CO2e in 2019, corresponding to the absorption of 7% of total GHG emissions.", "Total greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe\nGreenhouse gas emissions in the EU decreased by 31% between 1990 and 2020 \u2014 exceeding the EU\u2019s 2020 target by 11 percentage points.
