{"query": "How much of europe's population is exposed to fine particulate matter?", "texts": ["Urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above selected EU air quality standards, EU-27 and the UK. Source: EEA, Exceedance of air quality standards in Europe\nAir pollution emissions have been generally decreasing in Europe. However, exposure to air pollution is seen as the most important environmental risk to human health of the European population (WHO, 2016). Europe\u2019s most serious pollutants, in terms of harm to human health, are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3).\nExposure to air pollutants leads to a wide range of diseases, including stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, aggravated asthma and lower respiratory infections. There is also evidence of links between exposure to air pollution and type 2 diabetes, obesity, systemic inflammation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. For more information see: Air pollution: how it affects our health.\nAlthough air pollution affects the whole population, certain groups are more likely to suffer from exposure to it. This includes children, elderly, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing health problems. In large parts of Europe, lower-income groups are more likely to face higher exposure to air pollution live next to busy roads or industrial areas (EEA, 2018).\nIn 2019, approximately 307 000 premature deaths in EU-27 were attributable to long-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM2.5). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was linked to 40 400 premature deaths, and ground-level ozone (O3) to 16 800 premature deaths (EEA, 2021).\nIn recent years, the share of the urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above EU limit values, and the resulting health impact, has been decreasing for PM2.5 and NO2 (see figure above). For ground-level ozone, the northern hemispheric background concentration is increasing in Europe, while global peak values are decreasing (Andersson et al., 2017; Orru et al., 2019; Paoletti et al., 2014).\nThere is increasing evidence that negative health effects of air pollution occur also below the EU ambient air quality directive levels, and this is reflected in the new WHO global air quality guidelines (WHO, 2021). As the updated WHO guidelines are stricter for most pollutants, the share of the urban population exposed to unhealthy air pollutant concentrations and the associated health impact will be larger than previous estimates.\nChanges in temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, or solar radiation associated with climate change affect air quality, potentially worsening it (Fu and Tian, 2019). This happens via altered emissions from natural sources (such as wildfires, mineral dust, sea salt, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC)); emissions from human sources (such as ammonia from agriculture); rates of chemical reactions in the atmosphere; and transport, dispersion and deposition processes of air pollutants (Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017; Geels et al., 2015).\nIn relation to human health, the combination of heat stress and air pollution is particularly damaging. Simultanous exposure of population to high temperatures and air pollution (PM, NO2 or O3) has been linked to increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes (EEA, 2020). The ongoing and projected demographic changes, such as an aging population with increasing prevalence of underlying health problems, will also contribute to an increase of the burden of disease related to air pollution.\nParticulate matter concentrations in the air are projected to increase slightly in the future, albeit with some uncertainty (Doherty et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020). This is because climate change has an impact on the emissions of the precursors of PM: the number and severity of naturally occurring wildfires is expected to increase, as are sea salt emissions. Further, higher temperatures increase biogenic and agricultural ammonia emissions (Geels et al., 2015). Also, the chemical reactions leading to the production of secondary PM are intensified by temperature and humidity changes (Megaritis et al., 2014). Finally, decreases in wind speed, for example projected for parts of the Mediterranean region (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), and decreasing precipitation will reduce the dilution and deposition of PM, resulting in higher air concentration levels (Doherty et al., 2017).\nUnder the changing climate, higher ground-level O3 concentrations are projected during summer, with the largest increase predicted for the warmest scenarios and for Southern and Central Europe (Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017; Colette et al., 2015). The peak concentrations are projected to increase, which is relevant for health impacts, as short-term exposure to high peak concentrations of ground-level ozone is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular health problems (Doherty et al., 2017). Up to an 11% increase in ground-level ozone-associated mortality is expected in some countries in Central and Southern Europe in 2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario (Orru et al., 2019).\nGround-level ozone is formed in the atmosphere by photochemical reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. Under climate change, BVOC emissions are likely to increase due to a higher number of hot days; increasing atmospheric CO2 levels may also influence the production of BVOC (Fu and Tian, 2019). Increased global methane concentrations and higher temperatures also accelerate ground-level O3 production. Further, the expected greater influx of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere is projected to raise the ground-level ozone levels further across Europe (Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017).\nNO2 concentration levels are not expected to be influenced by climate change.\nHigh levels of humidity and flooding of buildings can support the growth of moulds and increase the prevalence of respiratory diseases (D\u2019Amato et al., 2020). Further, in urban areas air pollution (in particular long-term high NO2 levels) may increase the allergenicity of pollen (Gisler, 2021; Plaza et al., 2020), the concentration and seasonality of which is affected itself by the changing climate.\nThe revised WHO global air quality guidelines form a solid scientific evidence base for making decisions on clean air policy worldwide. Within the framework of the European Green Deal, the European Union is revising its Ambient Air Directives to align them more closely with the new WHO guidelines. Mitigation measures for reducing CO2 emissions often have a positive effect on the emissions of air pollutants from traffic, energy production, domestic heating, etc., creating a win-win situation.\nAir quality assessments, including health impact, are performed at an annual basis by different authorities. Forecast and early warning systems for air pollution, together with medical advice, can reduce the health risks. They can also be used by healthcare systems to prepare for higher numbers of patients in emergency departments. Forecast and early warning systems are operational at the local level as well as at regional scales, such as e.g. the EEA\u2019s European Air Quality Index. In several European countries ozone concentration levels are included in heat-health action plans.\nCitizen science projects on air quality provide evidence-based information and create awareness amongst citizens.\nAndersson, C. et al.

It finds that the majority of Europeans are exposed to levels of air pollutants known to damage health.report updates and expands on an by comparing pollutant concentrations in ambient air across Europe against the\nThe report finds that human activities are the key driver behind the dangerous levels of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in urban air. Overall emissions of all key air pollutants across the EU declined in 2019, maintaining the trend seen since 2005. Nevertheless, delivering clean and safe air for Europe will require ongoing and additional reductions in emissions. Looking ahead, the report says more action is required by all Member States if they are to meet future emission reduction commitments under the EU\u2019s National Emissions reduction Commitments Directive (NEC Directive).\nThe EU has also set standards for key air pollutants in the EU\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Directives. Under the European Green Deal\u2019s Zero Pollution Action Plan, the European Commission set the 2030 goal of reducing the number of premature deaths caused by PM2.5 by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels.\nTo this end, the European Commission initiated a revision of the Ambient Air Quality Directives, which includes a revision of EU air quality standards to align them more closely with WHO recommendations. Citizens and stakeholders are invited to express their views through a public consultation run by the European Commission until 16 December 2021.\nIn 2019, air pollution continued to drive a significant burden of premature death and disease in Europe. In the EU, 307,000 premature deaths were linked to exposure to fine particulate matter in 2019, a decrease of 33% on 2005.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europes-urban-population-remains-at or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:08 AM\nFiled under: air quality directive particulate matter air quality health and environment air pollution\nFiled under: air quality directive, particulate matter, air quality, health and environment, air pollution\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

However, in some European cities air pollution still poses risks to health. You can use the European city air viewer to check how the air quality was in your city over the past two years and to compare it with air quality in other cities across Europe.\nCities are ranked from the cleanest city to the most polluted, on the basis of average levels of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, over the past two calendar years.\nFine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. This tool is focused on long term air quality, with long term exposure to air pollution causing serious health effects.\nThe World Health Organization has established a health-based guideline for long term exposure to fine particulate matter of 10 \u03bcg/m3. The European Union has set an annual limit value for fine particulate matter of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe.\nThe viewer presents air quality as:\nIn Europe, we benefit from the most comprehensive air quality monitoring network in the world. Here we present levels of fine particulate matter in over 300 cities from across EEA member countries. Data comes from on the ground measurements of fine particulate matter, taken by over 400 monitoring stations.\nIf the dot representing a city in the map and the city name in the table are grey, then the city could not be included in the viewer for one of the three reasons below.\nClick on a city to see:\nThe table ranks European cities according to their average levels of fine particulate matter over the past two full calendar years.\nYou can click on the air quality categories, good, moderate, poor and very poor, to display the cities with air quality in that category.\nThe viewer presents cities as defined by the European Commission\u2019s Urban Audit. This geospatial dataset includes cities with a population over 50,000 inhabitants. A similar dataset is available for download from the Eurostat website (note that the European City Air Quality Viewer uses a processed 2014 version of that dataset with population numbers from 2011).\nWe use data on concentration of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, reported to the EEA by our member countries under the European Union Ambient Air Quality Directives. Two types of data are used.\nFine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. Long term exposure to air pollution is associated with the most serious health outcomes, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\nTo produce this tool, we use data from urban background and suburban background air quality monitoring stations that are situated within the boundaries of the cities, as defined by the Urban Audit, and for which countries report data to the EEA. These stations provide a robust picture of the exposure of the population to air pollution in cities.\nAir quality is also measured at traffic stations and industrial stations. Data from these stations are not used for this tool, as they are used to measure levels in more polluted areas, such as around industrial sites and near motorways and major roads with dense traffic. As such, they measure the exposure of populations around major roads and do not measure the exposure of the general population. In addition, traffic stations are unevenly distributed in cities across Europe, which might introduce bias when making comparisons.\nAir quality is also monitoring in rural areas, with the aim of understanding impacts on crops and natural ecosystem. Rural stations tend to be located away from the cities and are not included in this tool.\nFor some cities, we do not have data for either step 1 or step 2. In such cases, we use the annual mean for the available year.\nFor data from a station to be included, then a minimum of 75% temporal data coverage is required. This means that for an individual station, we consider those with more than 274 valid daily values per calendar year (or 275 days in a leap year).\nWe display four categories of air quality, including good, moderate, poor and very poor. These are defined by bandwidths of concentrations of fine particulate matter, as shown below.\nIn their guidelines for air quality, the World Health Organization established a lower annual air quality guideline for PM2.5 exposure of 10 \u03bcg/m3, as well as several interim targets. These values have been used to define the bandwidths for the four categories of air quality.\nPM2.5 (\u03bcg/m3)\nBasis for the selected level\nInterim target 1\n35\nThese levels are associated with about a 15% higher long-term mortality risk relative to the air quality guideline\nInterim target 2\n25\nIn addition to other health benefits, these levels lower the risk of premature mortality by approximately 6 % (2-11%) relative to interim target 1.\nInterim target 3\n15\nIn addition to other health benefits, these levels lower the risk of premature mortality by approximately 6 % (2-11%) relative to interim target 2.\nAir quality guideline\n10\nThese are the lowest levels at which total, cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality have been shown o increase with more than 95% confidence in response to long-term exposure to PM2.5.\nSource: Adapted from WHO, 2005\nAll measurement methods used have a degree of error. In particular, the up-to-date data (dataflow E2a) is not checked for outlying datapoints, which may be errors, and validated by the countries. This may introduce a limited number of more extreme values to the dataset.\nIn reporting the characteristics of monitoring stations to the EEA, countries may interpret the definitions of station types different. This can reduce comparability between cities.\nIt is assumed that all the urban and suburban monitoring stations in a single city represent background environments equally. The methodology does not account for the distribution of the urban population across the city. Treating stations equally may lead to an underestimate of the average concentration that the general population is exposed to, in the case where the area around a pollution hotspot is densely populated.\nIn large cities with dense urban centres where large parts of the population reside, stations in the city centre are likely to be traffic stations. Such stations are not included in the methodology and this may lead to an underestimation of concentrations of fine particulate matter.\nOnly measurements from urban and suburban stations that are in the urban audit geometries are considered in the calculations.\nIf you want to know what the air quality is in your city today, please visit the European Air Quality Index. The index presents information on air quality over the past two days and a 24-hour forecast, together with health-based recommendations for short term exposure to air pollution.

However, poor air quality remains a problem: in 2019, 21 % of citizens were exposed to O3 and 10 % to PM10 levels above EU standards. This is mainly because of emissions from transport and buildings, but also from agriculture and industry. Without radical changes to mobility, energy and food systems and industry, it is unlikely that air quality targets will be met in the near future.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||PM2.5||PM10||O3||NO2||BaP||SO2|\n|2000||52.6||25||25.8|\n|2001||38.9||42.1||21|\n|2002||40||26.9||22.5|\n|2003||46.9||63.9||31.9|\n|2004||33.3||22.9||19.2|\n|2005||40.6||28.3||20.1|\n|2006||20.4||45.3||54.9||16|\n|2007||13.7||33.2||26.1||19.8|\n|2008||15.1||26||18.4||11.3|\n|2009||11.5||26.7||19.8||12.9|\n|2010||13.3||27.9||21.3||9.6|\n|2011||17.6||33.5||19.8||10.3|\n|2012||13.8||25||18.9||7.5|\n|2013||8.7||21.5||17.4||9.4|\n|2014||8.2||16.4||7.3||8.1|\n|2015||7.2||22.7||29.4||8.4|\n|2016||5.5||12.9||12||7.1|\n|2017||7.8||16.8||16.5||6.4|\n|2018||3.8||14.8||34.2||3.5|\n|2019||1||9.8||20.6||3.3|\nMore than 70 % of EU citizens live in urban areas, where high population densities and economic activities cause high levels of air pollution. Such exposure is linked to adverse health effects, such as respiratory and heart problems, and cancer. Particulate matter (PM), O3, NO2 and SO2 are associated with serious health problems. The EU Air Quality Directive aims to protect health, vegetation and natural ecosystems by setting limit and target values for air pollutants (and long-term objectives for O3). The Clean Air Programme, published in 2013, aims to comply with this legislation by the time 2020 data are available.\nFor most pollutants, there is progress, with the percentage of people exposed to levels above EU standards decreasing since 2000. However, potentially harmful levels are still recorded in many areas. For instance, although substantially lower than the 47 % peak in 2003, in 2019, 10 % of urban citizens were still exposed to PM with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m or less (PM10) above the EU daily limit value.\nExposure to harmful levels of fine PM (PM2.5) and NO2 is less common, but 3 % of the urban population lived in zones exceeding the EU limit values for NO2 and only 1% in urban areas exceeding the EU limit values for PM2.5 in 2019. For SO2, the percentage exposed to levels above the limit value decreased between 2000 and 2019, to less than 0.1 % in the last 10 years (with a maximum of 3% in 2006). Therefore, these values are also not exhibited in Figure 1.\nO3 is a secondary pollutant formed from other pollutants in the presence of solar light. Its levels are determined by emissions and climatic conditions. The proportion of the population exposed to O3 above EU target levels has fluctuated from a 64 % peak in 2003 to 7 % in 2014. Since this low value, however, Europe has seen the two warmest years on record \u2014 2015 and 2018 \u2014 resulting in 30 % or more of the population being exposed to O3 above the target value. However, in 2019, this ratio decreased to 21%.\nAs there are relatively few reported measurements of BaP and these were not considered to be homogeneous across Europe until 2008, the values are not presented in the Figure 1. Considering data reported after that year, the portion of the urban population exposed to concentrations above the BaP target value has shown little variation within the range of 14-17 % in 2017-2019.\nDespite progress driven by EU policies to reduce emissions and protect citizens from pollutants, addressing the causes of poor air quality remains a challenge. Given the widespread exceedance of EU limit and target values in urban areas, the EU is not on track to meet air quality standards by 2020. Substantial efforts in relation to agriculture and energy use for transport and in buildings are needed to improve air quality and advance EU progress towards meeting climate change policy objectives.\n|Year||PM2.5||PM10||O3||NO2||BaP||SO2|\n|2000||86.8||95.5||25.8|\n|2001||83.2||97||21|\n|2002||80.8||99.7||22.5|\n|2003||89.8||95||31.9|\n|2004||77.5||99.7||19.2|\n|2005||81.7||97.9||20.1|\n|2006||96.9||84||99.8||16|\n|2007||89.1||87.3||98.7||19.8|\n|2008||85.3||78.1||98.3||11.3|\n|2009||89.7||84.1||99.4||12.9|\n|2010||89.8||83.9||98.9||9.6|\n|2011||92.3||86.5||97||10.3|\n|2012||89.9||72.5||97.8||7.5|\n|2013||86.3||62.1||98||9.4|\n|2014||86.5||50.3||95.9||8.1|\n|2015||81.5||53.6||95.9||8.4|\n|2016||74.6||42.1||98||7.1|\n|2017||77.3||45||96.3||6.4|\n|2018||73.5||48||99||3.5|\n|2019||60.9||35.8||98.3||3.3|\nThe EU Clean Air Programme set the long-term objective of complying with WHO air quality guidelines, which are much stricter than the standards set by the EU Air Quality Directive and are based on what is considered necessary to ensure the protection of human health.

Without radical changes to mobility, energy and food systems and industry, it is unlikely that air quality targets will be met in the near future.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||PM2.5||PM10||O3||NO2||BaP||SO2|\n|2000||52.6||25||25.8|\n|2001||38.9||42.1||21|\n|2002||40||26.9||22.5|\n|2003||46.9||63.9||31.9|\n|2004||33.3||22.9||19.2|\n|2005||40.6||28.3||20.1|\n|2006||20.4||45.3||54.9||16|\n|2007||13.7||33.2||26.1||19.8|\n|2008||15.1||26||18.4||11.3|\n|2009||11.5||26.7||19.8||12.9|\n|2010||13.3||27.9||21.3||9.6|\n|2011||17.6||33.5||19.8||10.3|\n|2012||13.8||25||18.9||7.5|\n|2013||8.7||21.5||17.4||9.4|\n|2014||8.2||16.4||7.3||8.1|\n|2015||7.2||22.7||29.4||8.4|\n|2016||5.5||12.9||12||7.1|\n|2017||7.8||16.8||16.5||6.4|\n|2018||3.8||14.8||34.2||3.5|\n|2019||1||9.8||20.6||3.3|\nMore than 70 % of EU citizens live in urban areas, where high population densities and economic activities cause high levels of air pollution. Such exposure is linked to adverse health effects, such as respiratory and heart problems, and cancer. Particulate matter (PM), O3, NO2 and SO2 are associated with serious health problems. The EU Air Quality Directive aims to protect health, vegetation and natural ecosystems by setting limit and target values for air pollutants (and long-term objectives for O3). The Clean Air Programme, published in 2013, aims to comply with this legislation by the time 2020 data are available.\nFor most pollutants, there is progress, with the percentage of people exposed to levels above EU standards decreasing since 2000. However, potentially harmful levels are still recorded in many areas. For instance, although substantially lower than the 47 % peak in 2003, in 2019, 10 % of urban citizens were still exposed to PM with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m or less (PM10) above the EU daily limit value.\nExposure to harmful levels of fine PM (PM2.5) and NO2 is less common, but 3 % of the urban population lived in zones exceeding the EU limit values for NO2 and only 1% in urban areas exceeding the EU limit values for PM2.5 in 2019. For SO2, the percentage exposed to levels above the limit value decreased between 2000 and 2019, to less than 0.1 % in the last 10 years (with a maximum of 3% in 2006). Therefore, these values are also not exhibited in Figure 1.\nO3 is a secondary pollutant formed from other pollutants in the presence of solar light. Its levels are determined by emissions and climatic conditions. The proportion of the population exposed to O3 above EU target levels has fluctuated from a 64 % peak in 2003 to 7 % in 2014. Since this low value, however, Europe has seen the two warmest years on record \u2014 2015 and 2018 \u2014 resulting in 30 % or more of the population being exposed to O3 above the target value. However, in 2019, this ratio decreased to 21%.\nAs there are relatively few reported measurements of BaP and these were not considered to be homogeneous across Europe until 2008, the values are not presented in the Figure 1. Considering data reported after that year, the portion of the urban population exposed to concentrations above the BaP target value has shown little variation within the range of 14-17 % in 2017-2019.\nDespite progress driven by EU policies to reduce emissions and protect citizens from pollutants, addressing the causes of poor air quality remains a challenge. Given the widespread exceedance of EU limit and target values in urban areas, the EU is not on track to meet air quality standards by 2020. Substantial efforts in relation to agriculture and energy use for transport and in buildings are needed to improve air quality and advance EU progress towards meeting climate change policy objectives.\n|Year||PM2.5||PM10||O3||NO2||BaP||SO2|\n|2000||86.8||95.5||25.8|\n|2001||83.2||97||21|\n|2002||80.8||99.7||22.5|\n|2003||89.8||95||31.9|\n|2004||77.5||99.7||19.2|\n|2005||81.7||97.9||20.1|\n|2006||96.9||84||99.8||16|\n|2007||89.1||87.3||98.7||19.8|\n|2008||85.3||78.1||98.3||11.3|\n|2009||89.7||84.1||99.4||12.9|\n|2010||89.8||83.9||98.9||9.6|\n|2011||92.3||86.5||97||10.3|\n|2012||89.9||72.5||97.8||7.5|\n|2013||86.3||62.1||98||9.4|\n|2014||86.5||50.3||95.9||8.1|\n|2015||81.5||53.6||95.9||8.4|\n|2016||74.6||42.1||98||7.1|\n|2017||77.3||45||96.3||6.4|\n|2018||73.5||48||99||3.5|\n|2019||60.9||35.8||98.3||3.3|\nThe EU Clean Air Programme set the long-term objective of complying with WHO air quality guidelines, which are much stricter than the standards set by the EU Air Quality Directive and are based on what is considered necessary to ensure the protection of human health. The European Green Dealproposes to revise the EU air quality standards to align them more closely with the World Health Organization recommendations. The WHO published new air quality guidelines in 2021, nevertheless the analysis in this indicator considers still the 2005 version.\nAs there are relatively few reported measurements of BaP and these were not considered to be homogeneous across Europe until 2008, the values are not presented in the Figure 2. When considering the estimated 'reference level' for BaP, the portion of the population exposed is much higher (84-91 % for 2008-2016 and 71-83 % for 2017-2019) and almost constant over the period.\nThe results for SO2 show that the portion of the urban population exposed to concentrations above daily WHO guidelines \u2013 which decreased steadily from a maximum of 84 % in 2000 \u2013 reached a minimum of 10% in 2015 and remained within the range of 17-30% for the period 2017-2019. Therefore, these values are also not displayed in Figure 2.\nOverall, progress has been made, with the proportion of the EU urban population exposed to PM, NO2 and SO2 above 2005 WHO guideline values decreasing since 2000. However, the EU is a long way from reaching its goal of complete compliance with the WHO\u2019s air quality guidelines. In 2019, 36 % of the EU urban population was estimated to be exposed to PM10 above the WHO guideline value, 61% to PM2.5, 3% to NO2 and 17% to SO2. The situation is even worse for O3: the proportion of the population exposed to O3 above the 2005 WHO guideline value fluctuated between 95 % and 100 % in the period 2000-2019, with no decreasing trend over time.\nFor the urban population exposed to concentrations both above EU standards and 2005 WHO air quality guidelines at country level, please see the EEA data viewer.", "Key messages\r\n\r\nDespite improvements,\u00a0air pollution\u00a0is still a\u00a0major health concern for Europeans.

This chapter gives the status of concentrations of pollutants in ambient air in 2019 and 2020 presented by pollutant, as relates to both EU air quality standards and WHO guideline levels. The assessment shows that, in spite of improvements in air quality in recent years, exceedances of standards are still common across the EU.\n\n\n\nEurope\u2019s air quality status 2021 is part of the\u00a0Air quality in Europe 2021\u00a0report.\u00a0\r\nThis chapter assesses levels of air pollutants in ambient air across Europe and compares them against both European Union (EU) standards\u00a0as set out in the\u00a0ambient air quality directives and the new World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines.\u00a0The EU air quality standards are less strict for all pollutants than the new health-based air quality guidelines that were published by the WHO in 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the majority of the urban population in the EU was exposed to levels of key air pollutants that damage health (see Figure 1). In particular, 97% of the urban population was exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter\u00a0(PM2.5) above the new WHO guideline level of 5 \u00b5g/m3.\r\nFigure 1.

The data were extracted from the EEA\u2019s reporting system on 27 April 2021.\r\nThe analysis of 2019 validated data includes maps and boxplots, while the analysis of provisional 2020 up-to-date (UTD) data includes only maps. 2020 validated data will be available later this year and presented in the 2022 air quality report.\r\nThe lists of countries that submitted data for 2019 and for 2020, additional information and further analysis can be found in the Eionet status reports\u00a0ETC/ATNI 2021/7\u00a0and\u00a0ETC/ATNI 2021/8, prepared by the\u00a0European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, Noise and Industrial Pollution.\u00a0This chapter updates a previous analysis to reflect the 2021 WHO air quality guidelines\r\n\r\nNavigate the tabs for information on each pollutant:\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPM10\r\nPM2.5\r\nOzone\r\nNO2\r\nBaP\r\nOther pollutants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPM10 are particulate matter with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m or less. They are emitted mainly by the combustion of fuels for domestic heating, while industrial activities, agriculture and road transport are also important sources. Some come also from natural sources such as sea salt or Saharan dust and, finally, some are formed in the atmosphere from the combination of different gases.\r\nAlthough exceedances of the EU daily limit value are widespread across the continent, the highest concentrations were found in some countries in central and\u00a0eastern Europe and in northern Italy. In most countries of central and\u00a0 eastern Europe, solid fuels such as coal are widely used for heating households and in some industrial facilities and power plants. The Po Valley, in northern Italy, is a densely populated and industrialised area with specific meteorological conditions that favour the accumulation of air pollutants in the atmosphere.\r\nFigure 2.

They are emitted mainly by the combustion of fuels for domestic heating, industrial activities, and road transport. As with PM10, they can also come from natural sources and can be formed in the atmosphere. Agricultural emissions of ammonia make a significant contribution to the formation of particulate matter in the atmosphere.\r\nThe highest concentrations were found in central and eastern Europe and northern Italy. As for PM10, the use of solid fuels is the main reason for the situation in central and eastern Europe, together with an older vehicle fleet. In northern Italy, the high concentrations are due to the combination of a high density of anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions that favour the accumulation of air pollutants in the atmosphere.\r\nFigure 5.

Emissions of these gases are anthropogenic and, in the case of VOCs, also biogenic. Ozone also enters Europe from other parts of the northern hemisphere and from the upper atmosphere. Meteorology plays an important role in the formation and interannual variation of air pollutant concentrations, and this effect is especially significant for ozone.\r\nFigure 8.

Andorra was the only country in which all reported concentrations were below the long-term objective.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main source of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is road transport, which emits NO2 close to the ground and mostly in densely populated areas, contributing to population exposure. Other important sources are combustion processes in industry and energy supply.\r\nThe highest concentrations\u00a0were found\u00a0across Europe in bigger cities with a high traffic volume.\u00a0The impact of the COVID-19 related lockdown measures during the reporting period is clearly seen for this air pollutant, as its main source \u2014 road transport \u2014 was also one of the most reduced activities.\r\nFigure 11: Concentrations of NO2 in 2019 and 2020 in relation to the EU annual limit value\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nConcentrations of\u00a0NO2 in 2019:\r\n\r\n22 reporting countries, of which 18 were EU Member States, registered concentrations above the EU annual limit value of 40 \u00b5g/m3\r\nAll the reporting countries registered concentrations above the WHO AGQ of 10 \u00b5g/m3\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12.

These measures resulted in a reduction of many activities (such as road transport, aviation, shipping, some industries), while some others remained more or less unchanged (such as agriculture) or might have increased such as household energy consumption.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhere do the data come from?\r\n\r\nThe concentrations are obtained from measurements in monitoring stations that are officially reported to the EEA by its member countries.

The analysis for 2020 is based on provisional data reported in near-real time throughout the year.

Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.\nIn the EEA\u2019s new city air quality viewer, cities are ranked from the cleanest city to the most polluted, on the basis of average levels of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, over the past two calendar years.\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the top three cleanest cities in Europe in terms of air quality were Ume\u00e5 in Sweden, Tampere in Finland and Funchal in Portugal. The three most polluted were Nowy Sacz in Poland, Cremona in Italy and Slavonski Brod in Croatia.\nOf the 323 cities included in the viewer, air quality in 127 cities is categorised as good, meaning that it falls below the health-based guideline for long-term exposure to PM2.5 of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 \u03bcg/m3) established by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe European Union has set an annual limit value for PM2.5 of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe. The viewer rates the long-term air quality as very poor when PM2.5 levels are at or above this threshold, with five cities in Poland, Croatia and Italy falling in this category.\nFine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. The viewer provides information on long term air quality in each city. Long term exposure to PM2.5 causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\nWhile there has been a marked improvement in Europe's air quality over the past decade, the EEA\u2019s latest annual air quality assessment found that exposure to fine particulate mater caused about 417,000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2018.\nWhile air quality has improved markedly over the past years, air pollution remains stubbornly high in many cities across Europe. This city air quality viewer allows citizens to see for themselves in an easy-to-use way how their city is doing compared to others on air pollution.\nIt provides concrete and local information which can empower citizens towards their local authorities to address the issues. This will help all of us in achieving the EU\u2019s zero pollution goals.\nHans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director\nThe viewer provides data on the levels of fine particulate matter in over 300 cities across EEA member countries. It uses data reported to the EEA by its member countries under the EU\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Directives. Data comes from ground measurements of PM2.5 taken by over 400 monitoring stations taken in urban and suburban areas within cities. These stations provide a robust picture of the exposure of the population to air pollution.\nReadings and rankings are based on a the annual mean PM2.5 concentration over the past two calendar years, using up-to-date data for the most recent year and validated air quality data for the year before last. The table ranks European cities according to their average levels of fine particulate matter over the past two full calendar years. The EEA will in the future investigate incorporating other important air pollutants into the new tool.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has established a health-based guideline for long-term exposure to fine particulate matter of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 \u03bcg/m3). The European Union has set an annual limit value for fine particulate matter of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe.\nThe viewer rates levels of air quality as:\nPlease note that not all cities are included. The data set includes cities that are part of the European Commission\u2019s Urban Audit and that have a population of over 50,000 inhabitants. Cities that do not have urban or suburban monitoring stations are not included, nor are those for which data from these monitoring stations covers less than 75% of days within a calendar year.\nIf you want to know what the air quality is in your city right now, please visit the European Air Quality Index. The index presents information on air quality over the past two days and a 24-hour forecast, together with health-based recommendations for short term exposure to air pollution. It also covers a broader range of air pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone.\nMore information on the health impacts of air pollution in Europe is available here.\nSee here for the European Environment Agency\u2019s latest annual report on air quality in Europe.\n2019-2020\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-european-city-air-quality or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 01:27 PM\nFiled under: environment and health urban air quality air quality air pollution\nFiled under: environment and health, urban air quality, air quality, air pollution\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others"]}
