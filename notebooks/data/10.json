The BISE Data processor is the external contractor, in charge of the development of the BISE portal.\nWhat personal information we collect and for what purpose\nIn the context of the BISE portal, we are not collecting and publishing personal data. We collect personal information only when we create an account in the Eionet User Directory (Eionet account) to authorise experts that might directly contribute to the BISE web content. Please see the privacy statement of the Eionet website for details on the Eionet User Directory.\nFor generic BISE users, as personal data we only process: IP-addresses, browser versions and other devices information (i.e. transactional data) that are necessary to securely deliver web pages to the internet client. These transactional data are also processed by the personnel at CERT-EU which provides security services for EEA and available to the EEA\u2019s Internet Service Provider (tdc.dk) and cloud provider Amazon in EU, therefore for them, their privacy policy applies.\nBISE users can request information about BISE, providing feedback and reporting bugs by sending an email at: BISE@eea.europa.eu; this email is accessible and managed by authorised staff composed by the EEA Eionet helpdesk staff and the BISE administrators via the Eionet Help Desk system (OTRS). Authorised staff can directly reply and solve a request, close the ticket of a request, forward it to the EEA or the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity (ETC/BD) experts that can also reply. Finally authorised staff prepare the annual anonymised statistics about the type of request.\nWe do not store personal data in cookies. By default, the browsing experience of BISE users is tracked by the EEA Matomo software in order to produce anonymised statistics. For example, EEA staff may collect some data on browsing experience such as masked IP address (anonymized by removing the last two bytes), the web pages visited by a user, the website page an user were redirected from. The statistics aims at improving BISE portal and the browsing experience.\nThe analytical reports generated by the EEA Matomo can only be accessed through the Eionet Directory authentication system by EEA staff, other relevant EU institutions\u2019 staff or by duly authorised external contractors, who may be required to analyse, develop and/or regularly maintain BISE. By default, EEA software Matomo installation respects users\u2019 preferences and do not track visitors which have specified \"I do not want to be tracked\" in their web browsers (aka \"Do not track\").\nHow long personal data are stored\nTransactional data (security logs) are stored for a maximum of 1 year for security audit purposes unless there is an individual reason to keep information for a longer period of time (e.g. when individual IP addresses are blocked if part of a DoS-attack).\nHow to contact EEA and right to appeal\nBISE users may contact the EEA\u2019s Data Protection Officer (DPO) in case of any enquiry relating to the processing of personal data at the following email address: dpo@eea.europa.eu.\nBISE users are entitled to have recourse at any time to the European Data Protection Supervisor (https://edps.europa.eu; edps@edps.europa.eu) if they consider that the rights under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data by the EEA.\nFootnotes\n- OJ L 295/39 of 21.11.2018\u21b5\n- https://www.eionet.europa.eu/about/privacy-statement/index\u21b5\n- Matomo is an open-source and privacy-oriented web analytics software. The term \"EEA Matomo\" refers to our installation, managed directly by EEA Staff and installed within EEA/EU.\u21b5\n- Masking of IP addresses. Institution, city and country origin are determined from the full IP, then stored and aggregated before a mask is applied. EEA Matomo uses an IP de-identification mechanism that automatically masks a portion of each user's IP (Internet Protocol), effectively making it impossible to identify a particular website visitor via the sole IP address.\u21b5", "Case Study Hub\nWelcome to the BISE Case Study Hub. Here, you can explore a selection of case studies that have successfully improved the status of a protected species or habitat due to targeted measures.\nGet inspired!\nWelcome to the BISE Case Study Hub. Here, you can explore a selection of case studies that have successfully improved the status of a protected species or habitat due to targeted measures. Explore how brown bears in Italy had almost died out before the LIFE project URSUS translocated bears from Slovenia to reinforce the local population. Discover the LIFE project HUNDIDI, which raised the population size of the extremely rare lilac flower species Dianthus diutinus from 20 000 to 100 000 individuals! Some case studies even went above and beyond their initial target and improved the population of other species in the process or strengthened the local economy.\nThe good practice examples presented here offer insights on how successful biodiversity management has been implemented across the EU. Detailed are the main challenges, planned and implemented conservation measures, stakeholders involved, cost and financing of specific actions and the key impacts achieved through protective measures.\nThe hub currently contains results for 12 case studies and is continuously being expanded to include further inspiring narratives.

This short term project also comprised an approach to TEEB study in a protected area/Natura 2000 (Natural Park of Serra de S\u00e3o Mamede \u2013 also a Natura 2000 site) with a strong focus on mapping economic values of selected and restrict number of ecosystem services. Economic value estimates were based on available information and relied mainly on the use of avoided costs (carbon sequestration and soil protection (avoided erosion), willingness to pay (biodiversity), and market prices (crop, extensive animal, and fiber production) methods. Besides the need of a more comprehensive approach (not possible in a very short term study), results shows that future TEEB approaches in protected areas should highlight the added value of the protection status/regime of the area within the broader economy of the widescape region, taking into account the indicators used in the study.\nDuring the course of this pilot MAES study ICNF is preparing a long term process, to be launched in 2016, and aimed at covering the mainland Portugal territory. As part of this effort it is foreseen the development of a MAES-related platform networking the most relevant scientific projects in course and data and information sources, and engaging other relevant stakeholders and public authorities.\nIn Portugal there is a lot of fragmented experience and interest from local level, stakeholders, NGOs and universities. The government launched several initiatives taking on board the importance of ecosystem services and natural capital for growth and jobs, such as green economy initiative, green tax reforms, TEEB approaches and ecosystem services assessment. The issue has been taking into account on partnership agreement and on the ongoing programming of ESIF 2014-2020.\nFollowing an exploratory MAES PT workshop in January 2015, a kick-off MAES PT conference will be held in December 11, 2015, with the presentation of MAES Alentejo pilot and other national case projects and studies, the participation of the Commission/DG ENV-Directorate of Natural Capital, JRC and EEA to frame the EU approach, and a debate with scientific community, decision-makers, and private stakeholders on the views and perspectives of a national MAES PT and the foreseen outcomes for policy making up to 2020.\nReference should also be made to the close participation of Portuguese authorities in EU MAES pilot study on urban ecosystem services, promoted by DGT (General Directorate for Territory Development) together with three municipalities including Lisbon which will host an expert workshop in February 2016.\nPreviously in 2014, portuguese researchers also co-leaded the MAES EU pilot study on forest ecosystems and participate in the MAES EU pilot study on marine ecosystems.\nSeveral projects headed by, or with the involvement of, Portuguese research teams are in course, including the involvement in other EU MAES activities, at national level, european level (e.g. OpenNESS, OPERA, ESMERALDA) and within IPBES global and regional assessments.\nDate: 25/11/2015\n- For additional information see the ESMERALDA country fact sheet", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.
