{"query": "How far does transport sector pollute in GHG total emissions?", "texts": ["Intro\nReducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector is a key priority for the EU. The transport sector is responsible for about one third of the total CO2 emissions in the EU, and it has not seen the same reduction in emissions as other sectors.\nWhat the data are telling us\n- The latest provisional data show that average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in 2020 decreased significantly, after 3 years of consecutive increases. Following a steady decline until 2016, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars registered in Europe increased between 2017 and 2019. Key reasons included the growth in the sport utility vehicle segment and an increase in average vehicle mass.\n- The reduction in CO2 emissions observed in 2020 was mostly due to a higher share of new registrations of electric vehicles in the fleet, up from 3.5 % in 2019 to 11 % in 2020. The share of sport utility vehicles in new car registrations continued to increase.\n- Petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, accounting for 58 % of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles accounted for 29 % of new registrations, including hybrid electric vehicles. The share of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (in the new fleet increased from 3.5 % to 11 %.\n- Following a steady decline between 2012 and 2017 then a slight increase between 2017 and 2019, average specific CO2 emissions from new van registrations decreased moderately in 2020 by 2.3 g CO2/km to 155.7 g CO2/km, based on provisional data. This decrease was, however, insufficient to meet the EU fleet-wide target of 147 g CO2/km, applicable since 2020.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic influenced the number of new vehicles registered in 2020: new registrations were 18 % lower than in 2019. In 2020, 1.36 million new vans were registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom.\n- Diesel vehicles accounted for 94 % of new registrations in 2020 and petrol vehicles for 2.5 %. However, sales of new battery-electric vehicles continued to increase slowly, reaching only about 2.2 % in 2020, compared with 1.4 % in 2019.\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, the European Parliament and the Council adopted regulations introducing mandatory CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles. Regulation (EU) No 2019/631 sets EU fleet-wide targets for average emissions of 95 g CO2/km for new passenger cars and 147 g CO2/km for new light commercial vehicles for the period after 2020. The EU fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030 are defined as a percentage reduction of the 2021 starting point. The regulation requires a 15 % reduction from 2025 and a 37.5 % reduction from 2030 onwards for new passenger cars, and a 15 % reduction from 2025 and a 31 % reduction from 2030 onwards for new light commercial vehicles.\nWhere the data come from\nAccording to the regulations, data on new registrations of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, including their CO2 emissions, are to be collected each year by Member States and submitted to the European Commission. Manufacturers can verify the data and notify the Commission of any errors identified in the data set. The Commission assesses the manufacturers\u2019 corrections, and, where justified, takes them into account in calculating their average CO2 emissions and specific emission targets.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Rarely in the publication \nof the annual Trends and projections in Europe report has this \nexecutive summary presented such substantial progress \nas this edition does. Preliminary estimates indicate that, \nin 2020, we witnessed the full achievement \u2014 and even \noverachievement \u2014 of Europe's 20-20-20 goals for climate \nchange mitigation, renewable energy deployment and \nenergy efficiency gains. This keeps Europe well on track in its \njourney towards climate neutrality by mid-century.\n\nAlthough the achievements of 2020 build upon many years of \nwork towards climate and energy sustainability, the progress \nmade in 2020 is also rooted in exceptional circumstances. The \nglobal COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many key facets of \nEuropean society and economy and has forced adaptation \nand change through crisis. At the time of this report's \npublication, Europe is slowly reopening from the lockdowns \nimposed in response to the pandemic, and stability is again \nbecoming palpable. However, with the return of normalcy \nis the risk of returning to old habits, old consumption \npatterns and unsustainable practices. The way that European \ncountries recover from the COVID-19 crisis will largely \ndetermine how much Europe's climate and energy progress \ncan be accelerated in the coming years. Although the EU \nreached its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target for 2020 \nwell before the pandemic and its impacts, and it was well \non its way towards achieving the 2020 target for renewable \nenergy shares, achieving climate neutrality by mid-century \nwill demand change at a much more rapid pace over the next \nthree decades.\n\nEstimated full achievement of the 2020 targets\n\nOver the past 7 years, GHG emissions in the EU have \nremained below the 2020 target levels, with one exception \n(2017). Largely decoupled from economic development, the \nfalling emission levels have been driven by a wide range \nof policies and measures that support more sustainable \npractices in all economic sectors. In 2020, GHG emissions \nin the 27 EU Member States (EU-27) were estimated to \n\nhave fallen by 31\u00a0% below 1990 levels and net emissions \nby 34 % below 1990 levels. This constitutes a substantial \noverachievement of the targeted 20\u00a0% reduction by 2020. \nThis\u00a0is\u00a0illustrated in Figure ES.1.\n\nWhile progress has been positive in terms of overall GHG emission \nreductions, more varied developments have been observed in \nthe individual economic sectors. The most notable emission \nreductions have been in the sectors covered by the EU Emissions \nTrading System (ETS), which includes large installations and the \npower sector in particular. In 2020, partly because of the reduction \nin economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nstationary EU\u00a0ETS GHG emissions in the EU-27 demonstrated an \nextraordinary 1-year reduction of 12\u00a0%, resulting in a total decline \nof 41\u00a0% below the baseline levels of 2005.\n\nWhile the pandemic may have affected the trading sectors' \nemissions, the 2020 achievement only confirms a trend \nalready established before the pandemic. From 2018 to \n2019, a decline in emissions of 9\u00a0% was achieved, indicating a \npossible longer-term transition sparked by the replacement \nof coal power generation with less emission-intensive \ngas\u00a0installations.\n\nMeanwhile, the sectors covered by national emissions \ntargets, including transport, buildings and agriculture, have \ndemonstrated a slower pace in reductions.\n\nDespite an estimated full achievement of 2020 targets at EU \nlevel, only 21 Member States are expected to have reached \nemission levels below their national target in 2020 (as illustrated \nin Figure ES.4). The remaining countries (Bulgaria, Cyprus, \nFinland, Germany, Ireland and Malta) will probably need to \nmake use of flexibilities to comply with their legal objectives. \nIn these so-called 'Effort Sharing' legislation sectors, the \ntotal approximated decline of 6\u00a0% in 2020 comprised a more \nsubstantial jump in progress than has been achieved in recent \nyears, when emission reductions have been more sluggish. The \nreduction in 2020 may therefore be largely attributable to the \neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also demonstrates the \nscale of change that will be necessary year on year to achieve \ncarbon neutrality in the long term.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n8 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAt the EU-27 level, land use, land use change and forestry \n(LULUCF) removes more GHGs than it emits, resulting in a net \ncarbon sink. However, the size of this sink has been shrinking \nin recent years, especially as removals from forest land decline. \nIn 2019, the EU's net carbon sink amounted to about 249\u00a0Mt \ncarbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), corresponding to about 7\u00a0% of \nthe EU's total GHG emissions. The net carbon sink is estimated \nto have remained at a similar level in 2020. Carbon removals \nthrough LULUCF have not been accounted for in the 2020 \ntargets under the climate and energy package but will be critical \nin the next decade. This is especially true as Europe works \ntowards new 2030 targets that are expressed as net emissions \nand include a cap of 225\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e of offsetting capacity.\n\nFigure ES.1 Historical trends and projections of greenhouse gas emissions\n\nNote: The historical development of greenhouse gas emissions is shown excluding land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) (light blue \nsolid line, labelled 'emissions') and including LULUCF (dark blue solid line, labelled 'net emissions'). Both of these trend lines include \napproximated values for 2020. The light blue line relates to the scope of the 2020 target, while the dark bue line reflects the 2030 \ntarget's scope; both include international aviation. Projections are shown in dashed and dotted lines according to the 2030 target's \nscope, starting from 2019. The projections reflect the most recent data submitted by all Member States; Germany's projections are \nonly preliminary. The pace notations in the bar at the top indicate the actual average annual change in net emissions (including LULUCF \nand international aviation) for 1990-2020. The necessary future change to achieve the net 55\u00a0% reductions between 2020 and 2030 is \ncalculated on an average annual basis, assuming a maximum LULUCF contribution of 225\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) in 2030.\n\nSources: EEA (2021b, 2021d, forthcoming_b).\n\nHistorical net greenhouse gas emissions \n\nHistorical greenhouse gas emissions without land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)\n\nProjections of net emissions 'with additional measures' (WAM) \n\nProjections of net emissions 'with existing measures' (WEM) \n\nMillion tonnes of CO2  equivalent (Mt CO2e)\n\n1990-2020 (net emissions)\nOn average per year:\n\n-53 Mt CO2e\n\n2020-2030 \n(net emissions) \nto reach -55 %\n\nOn average per year:\n -137 Mt CO2e\n\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n\n0\n\n1 000\n\n2 000\n\n3 000\n\n4 000\n\n5 000\n\n6 000\n\n2030 target\n(net emissions)\n\n2050 target\n(net emissions)\n\n2020 target\n(emissions)\n\nThe second headline target for 2020, which early estimates \nindicate has also been achieved, is the share of energy \nconsumed that was obtained from renewable sources. The \nEEA's preliminary estimates show that a 21.3\u00a0% renewables \nshare was achieved in 2020, and with it an overachievement \nof the target level for 2020 (as demonstrated in Figure\u00a0ES.2). \nWhile renewable energy accounted for an increased \nshare of energy consumed through electricity and heating \nand cooling uses, renewables consumption in transport \nincreased more slowly. According to estimates, the 10\u00a0% \ntarget for renewable energy in the transport sector was \nachieved in 2020, although only by a very small margin of \n0.1 percentage point.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n9Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nWhile Member States' aggregated progress in renewable energy \nshares was enough to surpass the 2020 target, according to \nEEA preliminary estimates, 22 Member States appear to have \nmet their national targets for 2020 in this area without making \nuse of statistical transfers. As indicated in Figure ES.4, Belgium, \nFrance, Poland, Romania and Slovenia had estimated renewable \nenergy shares in 2020 that were below their binding national \ntargets. To fully achieve the EU target without yet accounting \nfor statistical transfers, overachievement of national renewable \nenergy targets in some countries offset underperformance \nin others. This will be balanced out through use of flexibility \nmeasures in the legislation, such as statistical transfers, \njoint projects and joint support schemes that were deployed \nbetween Member States in the year 2020. Reductions in energy \nconsumption across Europe in 2020 also contributed to the \noverall achievement of the renewable energy target, which is \ndefined as the percentage of gross final energy consumption \nthat comes from renewable sources.\n\nFigure ES.2 Historical trends and outlook on renewable energy shares\n\nNote: The current 2030 target, adopted from the Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU), is a 32\u00a0% renewable energy share of gross final \nenergy consumption (RES share). The proposed target from the 'Fit for 55 package' is a more ambitious 40\u00a0% RES share in 2030. The \n2050 values represent the indicative share of renewable energy in the EU's gross final consumption as presented in figures 5 and 8 in a \nCommission staff working document (EC, 2020a) of scenarios that achieve a reduction of at least 55\u00a0% in 2030.\n\nSources: EC (2020a, 2021e); EEA (forthcoming_c); EU (2018); Eurostat (2021c).\n\nEU-27 Indicative trajectory from the Renewable energy directive (RED)\n\nEU-27 Indicative trajectory from Member States' 2010 action plans\n\nEU-27 Renewable energy sources (RES) share in gross final energy consumption\n\n21.3 %\n2030 target: 32 %\n\n2020 target: 20 %\n\nPercentage of RES share in gross final energy\n\nAproximated range of 2050 RES share \n\nProposed 2030 target: 40 % \n\n2005-2020\nOn average per year:\n\n+0.7 percentage points\n\n2020-2030 to reach 32 % \nOn average per year:\n\n+1.1 percentage points\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n\nThe third headline target for 2020 addresses energy \nconsumption in total as a reflection of energy efficiency \nimprovements. For many years, the achievement of this \ntarget \u2014 a 20\u00a0% reduction compared with a baseline \nprojection for 2020 \u2014 seemed unlikely, with outright growth \ncharacterising Europe's final energy consumption trends \nover the past 5 years, and only marginal declines in primary \nenergy consumption over the same period. The widespread \nlockdowns in 2020 appear to have substantially affected \nenergy consumption in Europe, harnessing the growth in \nenergy use by the transport sector for the first time since \n2013 and curbing industrial production. This ultimately \nprovided the momentous shift necessary to achieve the \notherwise distant target levels. Both final and primary energy \nconsumption levels in Europe are estimated to have fallen \nbelow the benchmark levels in 2020, by 2.6\u00a0% and 5.0\u00a0% \nrespectively, leading to an expected achievement of the \ntarget. This is illustrated in Figure ES.3.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n10 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAmong Member States, the primary energy consumption \ntarget for 2020 appears to be the most widely achieved. Only \nthree Member States' estimated primary energy consumption \nlevels exceeded target 2020 levels (Belgium, Bulgaria and \nthe\u00a0Netherlands). Achievement of the national 2020 target \nlevels for final energy consumption appears to have been \nless extensive than for primary energy: seven Member States' \nestimated final energy consumption exceeded their national \ntarget levels for 2020 (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, \nHungary, Lithuania and Slovakia). While 19 Member States are \nestimated to have achieved both their national primary and \nfinal energy consumption target levels in 2020, only sustained \nshifts in energy consumption patterns will prevent a rebound \nin energy use in the years of recovery from the COVID-19 \npandemic. This will be necessary to keep this target area on \ntrack towards achieving longer-term goals.\n\n2030: a step towards climate neutrality\n\nAchievement of the 2020 targets occurs against a global \nbackdrop of severe climate change impacts \u2014 flooding, heat \n\nFigure ES.3 Historical trends and outlooks on energy consumption\n\nNote: FEC denotes final energy consumption, while PEC denotes primary energy consumption.

This is a key starting point on the path towards long-term \nchange, and will require efforts across Europe to accelerate \nsubstantially over the coming decades.\n\nIn addition to the 2050 goals, the European Climate Law sets \na higher level of ambition for the 2030 benchmark on the way \nto mid-century. The previous binding 2030 target, of a 40\u00a0% \nreduction in GHG emissions, has been replaced by a net 55\u00a0% \ntarget to be achieved by the end of this decade. The estimated \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n11Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\noverachievement of the 2020 target, with a net emissions \nreduction of 34 % calculated for 2020, demonstrates that the \nnecessary scale of change to meet the new, more ambitious, \ntarget is possible. However, the progress already achieved \nwill have to be maintained during the recovery from the \nCOVID-19\u00a0pandemic.\n\nEU countries' projected emission reductions over the next \n10 years underline the importance of sustained efforts. \nWhen aggregated, these projections point to an anticipated \nreduction in net GHG emissions of 41 % by 2030 (compared \nwith 1990 levels) with the introduction of additional policies and \nmeasures. Most Member States have not yet realigned their \nambitions to the new net 55\u00a0% target for 2030, and the further \nintroduction of more impactful policies and measures across \nEurope will be important to bring the 2030 target within reach. \nHigher 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency \nhave been proposed to ensure their contribution to the net \n55\u00a0% ambition level for 2030. Substantial additional effort will \nbe needed to reach both.\n\nIn their national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period \n2021-2030 that Member States submitted under Regulation (EU) \n2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate \nAction, countries have indicated their total intended national \ncontributions for energy improvements. Together, these would \nbring the EU share of renewable energy to just over 33\u00a0% by \nthe end of this decade and result in a slight overachievement \nof the existing 2030 target of 32\u00a0%. To achieve the proposed \nincreased target of 40\u00a0% by 2030, a more rapid deployment of \nrenewable energy sources would need to be initiated. This is \nalso demonstrated in Figure ES.2.\n\nMore difficulty may be found in achieving the energy \nefficiency targets for 2030, as the NECPs indicate total national \ncontributions that would fail to meet the existing target level of \nleast 32.5\u00a0%, with final energy consumption missing the current \n2030 target by nearly 5\u00a0%. To align with the 55\u00a0% emission \nreduction target for 2030, more ambitious energy efficiency \ntargets have also been proposed. These would seek to reduce \nprimary and final energy consumption levels in 2030 by 39\u00a0% \nand 36\u00a0%, respectively. The need to establish focused and \neffective policies to reduce energy consumption, and to direct \nthe trends towards achieving the existing and proposed targets \nis immediate. This is also demonstrated in Figure ES.3.\n\nA just and sustainable transition\n\nAchieving the 2030 targets will be critical to ensure a \nmanageable subsequent increase in efforts towards \nachieving the 2050 goals. Deep and widespread change will \nbe necessary in everything from how Europe's buildings \nare renovated, used, heated and cooled; to how goods are \ntransported across Europe and people's mobility organised; \nto how land and forests are managed. In making these shifts, \nit is critical that the burden of change is evenly borne.\n\nIn the shorter term, recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic \ndemands that, if new and more sustainable practices are to \nbe maintained, they should be evenly spread across Europe. \nThe EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility commits billions \nof euros to supporting a sustainable recovery from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, with at least EUR\u00a0248 billion earmarked \nfor climate-related efforts up to 2026.\n\nIn the longer term, investments that are more consistent \nwith sustainable development objectives will be needed \nto support Europe's climate and environment ambitions. \nEurope's new taxonomy for sustainable activities seeks \nto ensure that financial flows can be channelled into \nstrengthening the kinds of innovation and practices that \nwill be aligned with a more sustainable future economy and \nclimate. Deploying renewable energy should not occur at the \nexpense of biodiversity, resource efficiency must be aligned \nwith continuing improvements in energy efficiency, and \nso\u00a0on. Such comprehensive change will require increasingly \nintegrated and systemic approaches.\n\nAnd at a larger scale, environmental and social justice must \nbe the cornerstones of EU climate and energy policy if real, \nlasting progress is to be achieved. The European Green Deal \ngives the Just Transition the highest priority, underlining \nthat no part of Europe's green ambitions can be achieved to \nthe exclusion of the others and that no one should be left \nbehind. Tracking progress in climate change mitigation will \nnecessarily be linked to tracking progress in all other areas \nof environmental sustainability. The indictors referenced in \nthis report are a small but important part of a larger, critical \nmonitoring system. This will be key in ensuring concerted \nefforts and progress towards achieving the ambitions of the \nEuropean Climate Law and the European Green Deal.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n12 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nFigure ES.4 Member States' progress towards 2020 national targets\n\nNo\nOn track\nYes\n\nFinal\nenergy\n\nconsumption\n\nPrimary\nenergy\n\nconsumption\n\nRenewable\nenergy\n\nGHG\nemissions\n\n(Effort sharing) \n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBulgaria\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nHungary\n\nCzechia\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands Poland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nNote: All calculations in this figure are based on the 2020 approximated data for GHG emissions, renewable energy shares and energy \nconsumption, in comparison with national targets for 2020.

Renewable energy sources exhibited a 19.7\u00a0% share of gross final \nenergy consumption in 2019, while Europe's final and primary energy consumption for 2019 was 2\u00a0% above \nthe intended limits for that year. For these last two parameters, increased effort was necessary to reach the \n2020\u00a0targets.\n\n\u2022 Early estimates indicate that Europe exited 2020 having fully achieved the 2020 climate and energy targets. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic is expected to have affected GHG emissions and energy consumption in 2020, but achievement \nof the 2020 targets first and foremost comes from sustained efforts over the previous decade.\n\n\u2022 Between 2020 and 2030, steeper GHG emission reductions will be required to achieve a net 55\u00a0% reduction \ncompared with 1990 levels. Net emission reductions in 2020 are estimated to have reached a level 34\u00a0% below 1990 \nemissions, and projections\u00a0(1) indicate that additional policies and measures planned across Europe will lead to a \nnet emissions reduction of\u00a041 % by 2030. Further introduction of policies and measures to reduce emissions in all \nsectors will be needed to achieve the net 55\u00a0% target.\n\n\u2022 To reach the 2030 target of 32\u00a0% of European energy consumption from renewable sources, the continuous \nintroduction of renewable sources for electricity generation needs to be sustained, especially in the light \nof additional direct demands for electricity from other sectors and for the production of other fuels such as \nhydrogen. For transport, heating and cooling purposes, the use of renewable energy sources will need to increase \nsubstantially. Technological and infrastructural developments, such as the spread of district heating and cooling \nnetworks and the integration of energy carriers other than bioenergy, need to be initiated.\n\n\u2022 Efforts towards reaching the 2030 energy efficiency target of at least 32.5\u00a0% will need to achieve a more rapid rate of \ndecline in energy consumption, and even more so if the energy efficiency target for 2030 is aligned to the net 55\u00a0% \nGHG target. Just to reach the existing 2030 target, the average annual decline in final energy consumption would \nneed to be of at least 9 Mtoe across the EU, compared with an observed average annual decline of 7 Mtoe between \n2005 and 2020, which includes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intensification will need to go well beyond \nthe national contributions set out by Member States in their national energy and climate plans, as these already \nindicate a collective gap in ambition of 4.6\u00a0% from the current final energy consumption target for 2030.\n\n(1) GHG emission projections reflected here stem from aggregating Member States' GHG emission projections that are submitted annually to the \nEEA. In the remainder of the report, these are referred to as 'projections' without further explanation.\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in the EU \n\n14 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n1.1 EU-wide trends in greenhouse gas \nemissions and energy\n\nPublished in 2021, this report looks at the progress achieved \nso far towards achieving European targets for greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emission reductions, deployment of renewable energy \nsources and improvements in energy efficiency. It is the first \nyear beyond the landmark 2020 targets of 20\u00a0% GHG emission \nreductions (compared with 1990 levels), 20\u00a0% share of gross \nfinal energy consumption from renewable energy sources \nand 20\u00a0% reduction in energy consumption (compared with \nthe European Commission's 2007 baseline scenario). From \npreliminary data for 2020, it is possible for the first time to \nestimate the achievement of these targets. At the same time, \n2021 is the first year on the path to Europe's ambitious 2030 \ntargets, which serve as a milestone towards achieving climate \nneutrality in 2050.\n\nThis chapter synthesises the conclusions of indicators published \nby the EEA in 2021 with a number of key figures, and reflects \nthe most recent data and information on emissions, renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency. Together, this information \nindicates that Europe exited 2020 with a solid achievement of \nthe 2020 targets and is well on the way towards achieving the \nnext set of targets in 2030.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows how the 27 EU Member States (EU-27) fare \nwith respect to their 2020 and 2030 targets in four areas: \nGHG emissions, final energy consumption, primary energy \nconsumption and renewable energy shares. Each area is \nexplored further in Section 1.2.\n\n1.2 Progress to 2020 and 2030 greenhouse gas \nemissions and energy targets \n\nAs illustrated in Figure ES.1 in the executive summary, \nGHG\u00a0emissions in the EU-27 have declined rapidly in recent \nyears, having reached 24\u00a0% below 1990 levels in 2019 and \nan estimated 31 % in 2020. These achievements include \nemissions from international aviation and do not account for \nland use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) contributions \n(and thereby reflect the scope of the 2020 target). With one \nexception (2017), emissions in the EU-27 have been consistently \nbelow the EU's 20\u00a0% reduction target for 2020 over the past \n7\u00a0years. \n\nNotably, GHG emissions decreased by an approximated 10\u00a0% \nbetween 2019 and 2020, and this is assumed to be strongly \nrelated to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; the magnitude \nof this effect, however, is as yet uncertain. By comparison, \nbetween 2018 and 2019 \u2014 years without any notable crisis\u00a0\u2014 \nEU-wide emissions fell by 4 %. This substantial reduction \nwas strongly driven by the substitution of coal with gas and \nrenewable energy sources in the EU power sector and may have \n\nbeen the beginning of a trend that was carried forward and \nintensified by the pandemic. \n\nIn the coming decades, momentous emissions reductions will \nneed to be sustained year on year, and throughout the recovery \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, to achieve climate neutrality in \nthe long term. To reach the 55\u00a0% target, emissions would need \nto decline by 101 Mt CO2e per year on average, which is about \ntwice the average annual reduction which is observed between \n1990 and 2020 (-53 Mt CO2e). \n\nThis means that between 2020 and 2030, steeper GHG emission \nreductions will be required to achieve a net 55\u00a0% reduction \ncompared with 1990 levels. This is visible in Figure ES.1, where \nthere is a notable gap between the steepest projections curve \ntowards 2030 and the new net 55\u00a0% target for 2030. While net \nGHG emissions reductions in 2020, including international \naviation, are estimated to have fallen to 34 % below 1990 levels, \nprojections indicate an expected net emissions reduction \nof\u00a041\u00a0% by 2030 through the introduction of additional policies \nand measures. While the projected ambition level would be \nsufficient to achieve the original 40 % EU-wide reduction target, \ntowards which most projections submitted by Member States in \n2021 were still oriented, further efforts will be needed to achieve \nthe net 55\u00a0% target. In July 2021, the European Commission \nproposed a comprehensive 'Fit for 55' policy package to set all \nrelevant sectors on the path to the new 2030 climate target, \nand future projections should be oriented to the new, more \nambitious target (EC, 2021a).\n\nTo support continuous reductions in GHG emissions in Europe, \nthree key EU policies are in operation. The EU Emissions \nTrading System (ETS) and the Effort Sharing legislation foster \nreductions in GHG emissions in Europe \u2014 the former through \na Europe-wide cap-and-trade system that mainly targets large \npower stations, industrial plants and aviation, and the latter \nthrough national targets for emissions reductions on a yearly \nbasis in sectors such as road transport, buildings, agriculture \nand parts of the energy and industry sector that are not covered \nby the EU ETS. At the same time, the legislation on emissions \nand removals from LULUCF provides an accounting framework \nfor Europe's net GHG emissions and removals from forest \nland and forest products as well as from cropland, grassland, \nwetland and settlements. This land sink plays a critical role in \nsequestering carbon, thereby reducing total net emission levels \nfrom other sectors. The following paragraphs describe these \nthree policy areas in detail.\n\nEmissions covered by the EU\u00a0ETS, which encompasses large \nindustry, power generation and other, similar installations, \nhave decreased significantly since 2005. The reductions here \nhave been particularly strong in the energy industries. These \ninclude emissions from public electricity and heat production, \npetroleum refining and the manufacturing of solid fuels and \nother energy industries, as well as fugitive emissions from fuel. \n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in the EU \n\n15Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nFigure 1.1 Current progress towards achieving the 2020 and 2030 targets in the EU-27\n\nContribution\n\n1 041 983 885\n\n2020\n959\n\n2020\n1 312\n\n935\n\nContribution\n\n1 498 1  350 1 1761 246\n\nContribution\n\n10.2 % 19.7 % 33.7 %\n\n2020\n20 %\n\n2030\n32 %\n\n21.3 %\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions 2005 2019\n\n4 639 3 743 2 783\nnet emissions with\n\nadditional measures\n\n3 940\n2020\n\n- 20 % 2030\n2 121\n\nnet 55 %\n\n2030\n846\n\n2030\n1 128\n\n2020 \n(approximated)\n\n3 377\nCO2\n\nTargets 2020/2030 \n\nEmissions (Mt CO2e) \n\n2030\nProjection \n\nFinal energy consumption\n\nTargets 2020/2030 \n\nConsumption (Mtoe) \n\nPrimary energy consumption\n\nTargets 2020/2030 \n\nConsumption (Mtoe) \n\nRenewable energy share\n\nTargets 2020/2030 \n\n% gross final energy\nconsumption\n\nTarget reached\nNot yet at target\n\nTarget reached\nNot yet at target\n\nTarget reached\nNot yet at target\n\nTarget reached\nNot yet at target\n\nNote: The 2030 'with additional measures' projection for GHGs stems from the aggregation of national projections reported to the EEA, while \nenergy consumption and renewable energy contributions for 2030 originate from final national energy and climate plans. Since no \nenergy efficiency target was established for the EU-27 in 2020, the 2020 energy efficiency targets shown in the figure were taken from \nEurostat. The final scope of the net emission target of -55% by 2030 is not determined yet. It is currently assumed that international \naviation and LULUCF are included in the net emissions. International navigation has not been considered\n\nSources: EC (2020c), EEA (forthcoming_a, 2021b, forthcoming_b, forthcoming_c), Eurostat (2021c, 2021d).\n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates that 2020 emissions levels in the EU\u00a0ETS \nwere well below the cap set for that year. 2020 emissions in \nthe EU ETS, largely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, were \nnearly 12\u00a0% lower than in 2019. This notable reduction followed \na 9\u00a0% drop in EU ETS emissions the previous year. In total, \nby 2020, emissions from EU-27 Member States' stationary \n\ninstallations had already fallen by a full 41\u00a0% since 2005. This is \nan overachievement of the level necessary to reach the 2020 \ntarget, for which a reduction under the EU\u00a0ETS of 21\u00a0% was \nplanned. Notably, the reduction that has already taken place \nunder the EU\u00a0ETS is at about the level necessary to achieve the \noriginal 2030 target (43\u00a0%). \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Energy_saving_statistics\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in the EU \n\n16 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nFigure 1.2 Breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions trends in the sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading \nSystem, the Effort Sharing sectors and Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry \n\nEmissions trading sectors\n(stationary)\n\n2030\n1 171\n-43 %\n\n2030\n1 775\n-30 %\n\nTargets 2020/2030 \n\nEmissions (Mt CO2e) \n\nTarget reached\nNot yet at target\n\nTarget reached\nNot yet at target\n\nEffort sharing sectors\n\nTargets 2020/2030 \n\nEmissions (Mt CO2e) \n\nAviation (international\nand domestic)\n\nEmissions (Mt CO2e) \n\nLULUCF\n\nRemovals (Mt CO2e) \n\n2005 2019\n\n2 066 1 385 1 089\n(with additional\n\nmeasures)\n\n2020\n1 597\n-21 %\n\n2020 \n(approximated)\n\n1 224\n\nProjection\n\n2 460 2 209 1 750\n(with additional\n\nmeasures)\n\n2020\n2 267\n-10 %\n\n2 085\n\n113 148 76\n\n-311 -249 -248\n\n2030\nProjection \n\nNotes: The figure depicts the current EU\u00a0ETS cap and the current 2030 target for the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation. Aviation \nconsists of flights within the European Economic Area, which are covered by the EU\u00a0ETS, and international and a part of domestic flights. \nThis sector is shown separately here because its trends diverge substantially from those of the stationary facilities under the EU\u00a0ETS, \nwith consistently increasing emissions from aviation and a substantial expected drop in emissions in 2020 due to the effects of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. All GHG emissions shown refer to global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange's\u00a0(IPCC's) Fourth Assessment Report. To allow comparability between historical data and legal targets, the 2030 Effort Sharing \ntarget, expressed using GWPs from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment report, was converted to be expressed as emissions using GWPs from \nthe IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. \n\nSources: EEA (2021b, 2021c).\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in the EU \n\n17Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nFor 2030, national projections indicate that total emissions \ncovered by the ETS in the EU-27 will be 1\u00a0216 Mt\u00a0CO2e with \nexisting measures and 1\u00a0089 Mt\u00a0CO2e with the implementation \nof additional measures, thus staying well below the cap of \n1\u00a0171\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e. However, actual progress will also be influenced \nby the development of the ETS price and progress in efficiency \ngains in the industry sector. \n\nIn 2019, EU emissions covered by national emissions targets \nin such sectors as non-ETS industry, transport, buildings, \nagriculture and waste, and covered by the Effort Sharing \nlegislation, were also below 2005 levels, albeit by a more \nmodest 10\u00a0%. Emission levels from 2015 to 2019 exceeded \n2014 levels, although a strong decrease of 6\u00a0% was observed \nbetween 2019 and 2020, which can be largely ascribed to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n\nOne of the greatest challenges to achieving national emissions \ntargets has been the transport sector. This is also reflected \nby an increase in final energy consumption in transport of \n6\u00a0% between 2005 and 2019. The trends in GHG emissions \nand final energy consumption in the transport sector are \nstrongly correlated with the economic context. The COVID-19 \ncrisis reliably explains much of the observed 13\u00a0% decrease in \ntransport emissions between 2019 and 2020, as restrictions \nput in place during the pandemic had wide impacts on people's \nand goods' mobility patterns. Disruptions often catalyse \nshifts in behaviour, and the pandemic may have encouraged \nmore sustainable transport choices, but it remains unclear \nwhether changes in transport during this particular crisis will \nbe maintained in the longer run. The introduction of additional \npolicies that support lower emitting and more efficient \ntransport will be important to avoid a rebound effect after the \npandemic and to ensure more sustainable transport behaviour \nin the long term (JRC, 2021a).\n\nFor 2030, projections of the effect of existing measures \nindicate an emissions reduction in the sectors covered by \nnational emissions targets from 2\u00a0209\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e in 2019 \nto 1\u00a0938 Mt\u00a0CO2e, thus missing the target by 163 Mt\u00a0CO2e \n(9\u00a0%). With additional measures, a level of 1\u00a0750 Mt\u00a0CO2e \ncould be achieved in 2030, meaning the current 2030 target \nof 1\u00a0775\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e could be reached. See also Section\u00a02.1 \nfor further details on projected emissions within the \nindividual\u00a0sectors.\n\nIn 2019, the LULUCF sector in the EU provided a net carbon \nsink of about 249\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e, corresponding to about 7\u00a0% of \ntotal GHG emissions. From 1990 to 2019 the size of the sink \nwas, on average, 299\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e, albeit with variations from year \nto year and a tendency towards a reduction in the sink size \nover the past decade. This sink is the balance of net removals \nof CO2 by forest land and carbon stored in harvested wood \nproducts, on the one hand, and of GHG net emissions mainly \nfrom cropland or the conversion of land to settlements, on the \n\nother. The\u00a0total size of the EU's net sink from forest land was \n329 Mt\u00a0CO2e in 2019.\n\nThe new target for GHG emission reductions in 2030 is \nexpressed as a net target. This new target takes into account \nthe contributions of Europe's carbon sink and caps the net \ncontribution of the LULUCF sector to the net 55\u00a0% target to a \nmaximum level of 225\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2e of reductions (although further \nremovals beyond this cap are anticipated). This means that \nother sectors will have to achieve continued and accelerated \nemission reductions. \n\nThis maximum LULUCF contribution to the target is smaller \nthan the current level of LULUCF removals, but Member \nStates' projections indicate that in 2030, natural sinks would \nshrink by about\u00a08 % with existing measures and by 1\u00a0% with \nplanned, additional measures (compared to 1990). With a view \ntowards achieving the climate neutrality target in 2050 and the \naim of achieving net negative emissions levels thereafter, the \nEU-27 will need to increase its sink size in the future (EC, 2018). \nThis will require investment in both the natural sink provided \nby certain land use types and forests and in technical sinks \nprovided by removing carbon from the atmosphere via carbon \ncapture and storage.\n\nIn the area of renewable energy shares, the EU-27 achieved \na total level of 19.7\u00a0% of total energy consumption from \nrenewable sources in 2019 (see Figure 1.1). Preliminary data \nfor 2020 suggest that the EU-27 achieved a total share of \nrenewables of 21.3\u00a0% in 2020. Thus, it appears that the EU \nhas achieved its 2020 target of a minimum 20\u00a0% renewable \nenergy\u00a0share. \n\nThe greatest shares of renewable energy were observed \nin electricity consumption and, to a more limited extent, \nin heating and cooling. At the same time, a reduction of \noverall energy used in the transport sector in 2020 due to \nCOVID-19 related restrictions has provided a contextual boost \nto the share of renewable energy consumed in this sector. \nPreliminary data for 2020 suggest that the 10\u00a0% target for \ntransport was achieved by 0.1 percentage point, although it is \nlikely that it was strongly affected by pandemic-related shifts in \ntransport behaviour. \n\nFrom 2005 to 2020, the total renewable energy share grew \non average by 0.7 percentage points per year. To reach the \ncurrent 2030 target of a 32\u00a0% renewable energy share, this \naverage annual increase will need to grow to 1.1 percentage \npoints from 2020 onwards. Progress in energy efficiency will \nbe essential in reducing energy use from all sources, while the \nintroduction of renewable sources for electricity generation \nneeds to increase to support the electrification, and thereby \ndecarbonisation, of other sectors. For heating and cooling and \ntransport purposes, the use of renewable energy sources will \nalso need to increase\u00a0substantially. \n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in the EU \n\n18 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAs required in the Regulation on the Governance of the \nEnergy Union and Climate Action, in 2019, EU Member States \nformulated national energy and climate plans (NECPs) and set \nintended national contributions for the continued introduction \nof renewable energy. Cumulatively, these intended national \ncontributions would lead to a slight overachievement of the \ncurrent 32\u00a0% target for renewable energy sources in 2030. \n\nHowever, this 32\u00a0% renewable energy target was aligned with \nEurope's original 40\u00a0% GHG emission reduction target, and \nto achieve the net 55\u00a0% target, the renewable energy share \nin 2030 will need to be greater. The European Commission \ntherefore proposes to increase the 2030 target for renewable \nenergy shares to 40 % (EC, 2021e). Member States' \ndeployment of renewable energy over the next decade would \ntherefore need to exceed the contributions set in their existing \nNECPs. The next updates to the NECPs will be due in mid-2023.\n\nFor energy efficiency, the outlook to the 2020 targets has \nbeen uncertain for several years and has often been marked \nby diverging trends. Unlike the EU targets for GHG emissions, \nwhich are expressed in comparison with the emissions level in \n1990, the EU targets for energy efficiency are based on energy \nconsumption levels for the years 2020 and 2030, projected \nfrom the European Commission's 2007 baseline scenario.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected levels of \nenergy consumption across Europe as industry and transport \nslowed or stood still for several months in 2020. Whereas, \nby 2019, the EU-27(2) had reduced energy consumption to \na level only 2.0\u00a0% above the 2020 target for final energy \nconsumption and 1.9\u00a0% above the target for primary energy \nconsumption, these trends shifted substantially in 2020. \nPreliminary data indicate that, in 2020, energy consumption \nfor the EU-27 was 2.6\u00a0% below the 2020 target for final \nenergy consumption and 5.0\u00a0% below the target for primary \nenergy consumption. This shift in 2020 means that the EU-27 \nmet and overachieved the 2020 target in its final year, after \nnot having been on track to do so.\n\nTaking into account the substantial drop in energy consumption \nin 2020, the EU-27 therefore demonstrated an average annual \ndecline in final energy consumption of 7.1 million tonnes of oil \nequivalent (Mtoe) from 2005 to 2020, or 0.7\u00a0% annually. In terms \nof primary energy consumption, this average annual reduction \nwas 17\u00a0Mtoe between 2005 and 2020, which corresponds to a \n1.1\u00a0% reduction per annum. \n\nEfforts towards reaching the current 2030 energy efficiency \ntarget of at least a 32.5\u00a0% reduction in energy consumption will \nneed to be maintained, and considerably intensified to support \nthe net 55\u00a0% GHG emission reduction target.\n\nBased on the energy efficiency levels estimated for 2020, the \naverage annual decline in final energy consumption in the \nEU-27 from 2020 to 2030 would need to be at least 9\u00a0Mtoe, \nor a 0.9\u00a0% reduction, to reach the current target. Similarly, \nprimary energy consumption would need to decline by at \nleast 12\u00a0Mtoe per year, or 0.9\u00a0%. This would require that the \nenergy consumption levels of 2020 (as observed during the \nheight of the COVID-19 pandemic) be sustained. Any rebound \nin energy consumption during the recovery from the pandemic \nwould require even greater subsequent reductions in energy \nconsumption to bring the current energy efficiency target for \n2030 within reach.\n\nSuch substantial intensification would need to go well beyond \nthe national contributions set out by Member States in their \nNECPs. Taken together, these contributions already indicate \na gap in ambition compared with the original 32.5\u00a0% energy \nefficiency target for 2030: the Member States' contributions aim \nfor 885\u00a0Mtoe (see Figure 1.1), which is 4.6\u00a0% above the current \nfinal energy consumption target of 846\u00a0Mtoe by 2030.\n\nIn the proposal for the revised Energy Efficiency Directive, the \nEuropean Commission has proposed more ambitious 2030 \nenergy efficiency targets, corresponding to a reduction of 36\u00a0% \nfor final and 39\u00a0% for primary energy consumption compared \nwith the 2007 baseline projections (EC, 2021f)\u00a0(3).\n\n(2) No 2020 energy efficiency target was established for the EU-27. 2020 energy efficiency targets were taken from Eurostat.\n(3) The proposal changes the way the targets are calculated and defined, comparing them to the latest baseline projections from the 2020 \n\nreference scenario (a reduction of 9\u00a0% compared with the projections for 2030).\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in the EU \n\n19Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nFurther reading\n\nEEA indicators:\n\n\u2022 Total greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe\n\n\u2022 Share of energy consumption from renewable sources in Europe\n\n\u2022 Use of renewable energy for transport in Europe\n\n\u2022 Primary and final energy consumption in Europe\n\n\u2022 Progress to national greenhouse gas emission targets in Europe\n\nOther sources: \n\n\u2022 An EU-wide assessment of national energy and climate plans\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/greenhouse-gas-emission-trends-7/assessment\f\n\u00a9 C Dustin, on Unsplash\n\f\n21Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n2 \nGreenhouse gas emissions \nand energy trends at the \n\nsectoral level\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 Achievements in emission reductions since 2005 are diverse at the sectoral level. The highest reductions are \nobserved in the energy supply sector, where emissions decreased by 43\u00a0% between 2005 and 2020. Considerably \ngreater efforts are needed in the transport and agricultural sectors, where emissions fell by only 14\u00a0% and 2\u00a0%, \nrespectively. While energy supply is widely covered by the EU Emissions Trading System, transport and agriculture \nare addressed by national targets and therefore require further adoption or implementation of measures at the \nnational level.\n\n\u2022 The latest greenhouse gas (GHG) projections show that considerable further emission reductions are expected \nup to 2030 from existing policies and measures. This is particularly true for the buildings sector, which covers \nenergy consumption in private and commercial buildings, and also for agriculture, forestry and fishery. Additional \npolicies and measures will also be important to achieve emission reductions across all sectors, particularly in \nthe transport sector, where emissions are projected to stay relatively unchanged based on the contributions of \nexisting measures alone.\n\n\u2022 In the design of additional policies and measures that address GHG emission reductions, growth in renewable \nenergy shares and improved energy efficiency and interactions between the sectors and target areas will need to \nbe taken into account. Shifts in one area can directly or indirectly affect the others, requiring a systemic approach \nin line with the ethos of the European Green Deal.\n\nTransitioning to a climate-neutral Europe requires that \ninteractions between sectors are recognised and addressed. \nProjected emission reductions in one sector often impact \nother sectors, through higher demand for electricity or due to \nincreased demand for biomass, for example. Competing uses of \nresources need to be monitored to avoid inconsistent or even \ncompeting developments in different sectors.\n\nSince 2013, the annual Trends and projections in Europe report \nhas presented progress in the linked areas of greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. \nShifts in one of these areas can strongly affect the others, and \nachieving Europe's 2030 targets and long-term goals of climate \nneutrality by mid-century will require aligned efforts.\n\nAt a greater level of granularity, developments in GHG \nemissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency totals \nare the composite of developments in individual sectors. \nAs described in Chapter 1, growth in the use of renewable \nsources of energy in transport has been lagging behind, \nwhile energy generation has made remarkable contributions \nto decarbonisation. This chapter looks more closely at \ndevelopments within individual sectors and describes how \ninteractions between them can necessitate a more effective, \ncross-sectoral approach to achieving Europe's climate \nsustainability targets in the medium and long terms.\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends at the sectoral level \n\n22 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n2.1 Sectoral trends and projections\n\nIn this section, developments in the following sectors are \ndescribed: energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture \nand waste. Figure 2.1 provides an overview of historical and \nprojected developments within each sector, and the note \nexplains how the sectors are defined. Selected details from \nthe figure are also analysed in the subsequent paragraphs. \n\nThis section also highlights significant sectoral developments \nin individual EU Member States, many of which are observed \nin smaller Member States. Greater percentage changes in \nsmaller countries are important to note, even if they may \nnot translate into large absolute values. They can, however, \nhighlight significant individual efforts made to bring about \nnational\u00a0progress.\n\nIn 2020, the greatest sectoral share of emissions in the \nEU-27 occurred in the energy supply sector (e.g., power \n\nand heat production, oil and gas extraction and refining \nand coal mining), despite the fact that total emissions in \nthis sector had fallen by about 43\u00a0% since 2005 according \nto preliminary estimates. These estimates also indicate that \nemissions decreased by 8 % between 2019 and 2020, only \npartly due to pandemic effects. The reductions since 2005 \nare mainly due to the reduced carbon intensity of fuels, and \nespecially the increased use of renewable energy sources. \nThe EEA has also demonstrated that further co-benefits of \nthis transition have been seen in a reduction in air pollutants, \ndepending on the type of renewable technology deployed \n(EEA, 2019).\n\nBetween 2005 and 2020, the share of electricity from \nrenewable sources consumed in the EU-27 grew from \n16\u00a0% to 37\u00a0%, which corresponds to an average increase of \n1.4\u00a0percentage points per year. In 2019, the share was 34\u00a0%, \nwith roughly half of all renewable electricity generated by \nvariable sources (wind and solar power).\n\nFigure 2.1 Sectoral trends and progress towards achieving the 2020 and 2030 targets in the EU-27\n\nNotes: The energy supply sector covers GHG inventory categories\u00a01.A.1 and 1.B; industry covers categories\u00a01.A.2 and 2; transport covers \ncategory\u00a01.A.3; buildings covers categories\u00a01.A.4 and 1.A.5; agriculture covers category\u00a03; waste covers category\u00a05; international transport \nis reported under memo items; and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) is reported under category\u00a04.

Aside \nfrom subsidies for electricity production from renewable energy \nsources, this price has been an important driver of declining \nGHG emissions, especially as the price has risen in recent years \nfrom around EUR\u00a05/t\u00a0CO2 in 2017 to EUR\u00a025/t\u00a0CO2 in 2020, \nclimbing to more than EUR\u00a0above 60/t\u00a0CO2 in 2021 (EC, 2020e; \nEmber, 2021; ETC/CME, forthcoming).\n\nIn the energy supply sector, emission reductions are projected, \nwith current policies and measures, to deliver a reduction of \n8\u00a0% by 2030 compared with projected levels for 2020, which \nare considerably higher than those from preliminary estimates. \nAdditional national policies and measures are projected to \nnearly double reductions in energy supply emissions. While \nthese emission reductions are anticipated, electricity demand \nin many Member States is expected to increase as a result of \ndevelopments in other sectors. With a strong trend towards \nelectrification in the transport and buildings sectors, as well as \nadditional electricity demand expected from industry and for \nthe production of hydrogen, the need for additional renewable \nenergy capacities is growing in parallel.\n\nAt country level, the greatest emission reductions from \nthe energy supply sector since 2005 have been observed \nin Luxembourg; the decrease of 80\u00a0% is mainly an effect of \nLuxembourg's already very low emission level in this sector as \na result of its large share of energy imports and the closure of \none power plant (Luxembourg, 2020; industri.lu, 2021). The \nmost modest energy supply-related emission reductions have \noccurred in Cyprus, where a 13\u00a0% decline has been observed. \nIn Cyprus, the growth in renewable electricity production has \nnot been able to cover increasing electricity demand. With \npreliminary estimates for 2020, both Luxembourg and Cyprus \nhave shares of renewables in electricity consumption that are \nwell below the EU average at 14\u00a0% and 13\u00a0%, respectively.\n\nIn 2020, one fifth of the total GHG emissions in the EU-27 \nwere attributed to industrial activities, which exclude energy \ngeneration. These emissions aggregate both the energy needs \nof various industries (manufacturing, construction, cement \nproduction, etc.) and their process-related emissions. Total \nemissions from industry fell by 27\u00a0% between 2005 and 2020, \nwith the greatest reduction of 58\u00a0% being observed in Estonia. \nThis includes a substantial drop in 2020 related to the effects of \npandemic restrictions and particularly mild winter conditions, \npaired with a continued decline in the country's oil shale \nsector because of high carbon prices (Eesti Energia, 2021). \nMeanwhile, a notable increase in emissions occurred in Malta's \n\nindustry sector, mainly due to the use of hydrofluorocarbons in \nrefrigeration and air conditioning (Malta, 2021).\n\nProjections of industrial emissions show a moderate expected \ndecrease of 6-8\u00a0% between levels projected for 2020 and \nprojections to 2030. About 75\u00a0% of emissions in this sector \nare covered under the EU\u00a0ETS, but, due to the free allocation \nof allowances to avoid carbon leakage, the effect of the \nsystem's price for CO2 is lower in the industry sector than in the \nenergy\u00a0sector.\n\nThe transport sector is the second largest source of emissions \nin the EU-27 and its emissions are almost completely covered \nby national emissions targets. For 2020, estimated transport \nemissions show a decrease of 14\u00a0% compared with 2005. Only \nresolute efforts will be able to sustain this as a trend, as this \ndrop is mainly related to lower passenger road transport activity \nas a result of the pandemic situation in 2020. Up until 2019, \nthe increasing transport demand could not be outweighed by \nthe increasing efficiency of vehicles, and as a result, transport \nemissions in 2019 closely resembled those observed in 2005 \n(EEA, 2020). In addition, there was an increase in CO2 emissions \nfrom new passenger cars between 2017 and 2019 due to the \ngrowth in the number of sport utility vehicles (EEA, 2021a). \nWith limited emission reductions overall in this sector over the \npast 15 years, considerable efforts will be critical if the sector \nis to contribute adequately to Europe's overall emissions \nreduction\u00a0target.\n\nSimilar to the energy supply sector, there is an important \ndifference between estimated emissions for 2020 and the \nlevels of emissions in 2020 that many Member States had \nprojected, as not all projections submitted in March 2021 reflect \nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States project \nthat existing policies and measures will keep transport-related \nemissions in 2030 at nearly the same level that they have \nprojected for 2020. Emission reductions are projected only if \npolicies and measures additional to those in place today are \nimplemented. With these, emissions from transport in 2030 \ncould fall to 14\u00a0% below projected 2020 levels. \n\nTo support even greater emission reductions by 2030, the \nEuropean Commission has proposed more stringent emissions \nstandards for cars and vans that would require, inter alia, \naverage emissions from new cars to fall by 55\u00a0% by 2030 \n(compared with 2021 levels). According to the proposal, all new \ncars registered in the EU as of 2035 would be zero-emission \nvehicles. The result of these measures should be a clear \ndownwards trend in emissions from the transport system to \nreach the necessary reductions levels by 2050.\n\f\n24 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, renewable energy sources \nin the transport sector accounted for 10.1 % of the sector's \ngross final energy consumption in 2020, very close to the 10\u00a0% \nEU target for this sector. This proportion was 8.9\u00a0% in 2019, \nand the strong increase between 2019 and 2020 is related \nto the drop in demand for transport. In Sweden and Finland, \na high share of renewable energy used in transport in 2020 \n(estimated at 29\u00a0% in Sweden, thanks to strong progress in \nthe electrification of the transport infrastructure and the use \nof biofuels, and estimated at 21\u00a0% in Finland) contributed \nto these countries' emission reductions of 26\u00a0% and 19 %, \nrespectively, between 2005 and 2020. At the same time, \ntransport emissions increased by 76\u00a0% in Poland, as emissions \nfrom cars, heavy-duty trucks and buses increased. \n\nAcross Europe, blended biofuels and electromobility have \nproven to be important options for reducing the emissions \nfrom and renewable energy share used in transport. However, \nincreasing reliance on biofuels and electromobility also puts \npressure on agriculture, energy supply sectors, land use, land \nuse change and forestry (LULUCF), as these sectors' resources \nare also needed elsewhere \u2014 including to support increases \nin Europe's carbon sink and providing renewable energy for \nother sectors. This underlines the need for an integrated, \nsystemic approach to policymaking.\n\nEmissions from international aviation and international \nshipping, as reported in GHG inventories, cover emissions \nfrom voyages that depart in one EU Member State and \narrive in any other EU or non-EU country. For international \naviation, these emissions grew by 38\u00a0% between 2005 \nand 2019 and are projected to increase further, albeit at a \nslower pace. This sector has been hard hit by the COVID-19 \npandemic, and in 2020 emissions are estimated to have fallen \nsubstantially\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even far below the level in 2005 \u2014 which is \ncontrary to the trends of the past decade. Projections, which \nlargely did not consider the full pandemic effects, show a \nfurther expected increase of emissions from international \naviation of 42\u00a0% between projected 2020 and 2030 levels \nwith additional measures. Emissions from domestic and \ninternational flights between airports within the European \nEconomic Area are covered under the EU\u00a0ETS. Emissions from \ninternational flights increased in all Member States between \n2005 and 2019, with the lowest increase of 3\u00a0% in Hungary. \nIntra-EU aviation emissions tripled in Poland in the same \ntimeframe, mainly due to the substantial increase in low-cost \ncarriers' flights within the European Economic Area since \nPoland joined the EU in 2004.\n\nAt the EU level, shipping-related international emissions fell \nby 10\u00a0% between 2005 and 2019, which is still considerably \ngreater than the 1990 level. The projected emissions from \nthis sector are estimated to increase by 8 % with existing \nmeasures up until 2030 compared with the projected 2020 \nlevel, and by only a small further reduction of 1 percentage \npoint with additional measures. \n\n\u00a9 Ivan Bandura, on Unsplash\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends at the sectoral level \n\n25Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAmong Member States, the most notable drops in shipping \nemissions were observed in Germany, where mainly fuel price \neffects are responsible for the halving of emissions between \n2005 and 2019. Slovakia displays a large increase, however, \nmainly due to the very small shipping-related emissions in \nthat country. Reported emissions are based on fuels sold \nand may not be directly linked to transport activities. The \nEuropean Commission's proposal of July 2021 in part includes \ninternational shipping under the EU\u00a0ETS.\n\nDirect emissions from the buildings sector accounted for \n15\u00a0% of the EU-27's total emissions in 2020. From preliminary \nestimates, emissions in this sector have fallen by 24\u00a0% \nsince 2005. Emissions from district heating and electricity \nconsumption in buildings are not allocated to the buildings \nsector but rather are reported under the energy sector. \nRemaining emissions in the buildings sector are mainly covered \nby the national emission targets under the Effort Sharing \nRegulation ((EU) 2018/842).\n\nThe demand for energy for heating and cooling buildings \nis strongly related to climatic conditions and their annual \nvariations. This demand is measured through indicators on \n'heating degree days' and 'cooling degree days', which are \nderived from measurements of the outside air temperature \nabove or below which buildings need no heating or cooling. In \n2020, heating degree days for the EU-27 were the lowest since \n1979, when they started being reported to Eurostat. Heating \nand cooling, as defined under the Renewable Energy Directive \n(2018/2001/EU), includes the production of renewable district \nheating and cooling and all final consumption of renewable \nenergy, except transport and electricity. The use of renewable \nsources for heating and cooling is only slowly increasing; \nbetween 2005 and 2020, the share of renewable contributions \nacross the EU-27 grew on average by 0.7 percentage points \nper year. According to preliminary EEA estimates, the share of \nenergy from renewable sources used in this sector increased to \n23\u00a0% in 2020. The uptake of heat pumps is positively affecting \nrenewables in the buildings sector, but their share in the \ngross final energy consumption of the EU-27 was less than \n3\u00a0% in 2019; biomass fuels (excluding municipal solid waste) \naccounted for about 18\u00a0% of all fuels used for heating and \ncooling in the building sector (Eurostat, 2021b).\n\nThe highest GHG emission reductions in the buildings sector \nhave been observed in Greece, where a reduction of 62\u00a0% was \nobserved between 2005 and 2020. This results from an overall \ndecrease in the consumption of all fuels used for heating and \ncooling, while the use of renewable energy, including that \nfrom heat pumps, increased. Sweden has also made major \nemission reductions in this sector, of more than 50\u00a0% in the \nsame timeframe. One reason for this is Sweden's high share \nof renewables in the heating and cooling sector under the \nRenewable Energy Directive, which accounted for 66\u00a0% in \n2019 and increased to 69\u00a0% in 2020, according to preliminary \nestimates. Sweden is also one of the three Member States \n\nwith the highest shares of energy supplied by heat pumps, \nwith a 2019 total of 10\u00a0% of gross final energy consumption for \nheating and cooling. At the other end of the spectrum, buildings \nemissions in Lithuania in 2020 were at the same level as in \n2005, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nLooking towards 2030, significant emission reductions in the \nbuildings sector are projected, even just from existing policies \nand measures, to lead to a 10\u00a0% reduction compared with \nthe projected 2020 level. Additional policies and measures \nwould result in an emission reduction of 18\u00a0% in 2030. To \nachieve the new climate targets, the European Commission has \nproposed to introduce a price signal on CO2 that would cover \nthe buildings sector, as well as to revise the Energy Efficiency \nDirective, the Renewable Energy Directive and the Energy \nPerformance of Buildings Directive (EC, 2021d). See Chapter 4 \nfor more\u00a0information.\n\nGHG emissions from agriculture account for about 12\u00a0% of \nEU-27 emissions and are entirely covered by national emissions \ntargets under the Effort Sharing legislation. Similar to the \ntransport sector, agricultural sector emissions in 2019 and \n2020 were at about the same level as in 2005; more notable \nreductions in this sector predate 2005. The greatest emission \nreductions in this sector since 2005 in percentage terms have \nbeen achieved by Malta, in large part due to declining livestock \nemissions (EEA, 2021b). At the same time, emissions from \nagricultural soils grew most in Estonia during the same period \nand resulted in an overall increase in this sector of 27\u00a0% in 2019 \nand an estimated 29\u00a0% in 2020. Accession to the EU played an \nimportant role in Estonia's agricultural sector emissions and led \nto a turnaround in the country's otherwise downwards trend in \nagricultural emissions that started in 1990 (Estonia, 2021).\n\nProjections based on existing policies and measures across \nthe EU show low emission reductions of 1 % in agriculture \nuntil 2030, with additional policies and measures expected to \nincrease the reductions to 4 %. It will be particularly important \nto tackle emissions from livestock to bring the agricultural \nsector into line with the EU's emission reduction targets.\n\nThe waste sector accounted for only 3\u00a0% of GHG emissions \nin 2020 and is included in national emissions targets under \nthe Effort Sharing legislation. Waste-related emissions have \nbeen considerably reduced since 2005, amounting to a 25\u00a0% \nreduction in 2020. It is estimated that further reductions of 15\u00a0% \nup to 2030 (compared with the projected 2020 level) will be \nachieved mainly through existing policies and measures. \n\nAmong EU countries, the greatest waste-related emissions \nreduction has been observed in Sweden, which achieved a \n62\u00a0% drop between 2005 and 2020. This is mostly due to the \ndiversion of materials from the waste stream through recycling \nand using the remaining waste to generate energy. Meanwhile, \nemissions in this sector increased in Czechia by 41\u00a0%, mainly \nfrom waste disposal.\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends at the sectoral level \n\n26 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAs described in Chapter 2, the LULUCF sector is a net sink at \nEU level, but the sink was reduced by about one fifth between \n2005 and 2020.

The way these sectors interact with \neach other and the possible displacement of emissions from \none sector to another also need to be taken into account in a \ncoherent policy framework. New types of energy flows between \nusers and producers will require a more integrated EU energy \nsystem (EC, 2020d).\n\nFor instance, decarbonising the buildings, industry and \ntransport sectors by increasingly relying on electricity as an \nenergy carrier will require an increase in the use of renewable \nenergy sources to generate the additional electricity needed \nto satisfy demand. Otherwise, this additional demand will \ngenerate additional emissions.\n\nThe continued electrification of end use sectors also means \nthat, as the energy source changes (e.g., from direct combustion \nto electricity), emissions related to the same end use can shift \nfrom one category of policy instruments (e.g., standards and \nregulations to achieve national emission targets under the \nEffort Sharing Regulation) to another (economic tools such as \nthe EU-wide ETS).\n\nTo monitor progress towards achieving the climate neutrality \nobjectives, further integration of the EU energy system will \nrequire that emissions trends in various sectors are considered \nin an aggregated way rather than individually. This is because of \nthe way emission reductions are estimated and accounted for, \nand in particular because emissions associated with electricity \ngeneration are attributed to the power sector rather than to \nelectricity end use sectors. \n\nAs a result of how emissions are accounted for, which \nis different from how economic sectors are traditionally \ndelineated, investments made in one sector may not be \nvisible in national GHG inventories as emission changes in \nthat same sector. Certain sectors may see their emissions fall \nbecause of actions undertaken in other sectors, e.g., reduced \nemissions in the power sector due to the generation and use \nof biogas triggered by investments made in the agricultural \nsector, or reduced emissions in the transport sector due to the \nuse of agricultural or forest residues as transport fuels. The \nprojected emission reduction of 14\u00a0% between 2020 and 2030 \nin the transport sector, which is based on additional policies \n\nand measures, is mainly due to continued electrification \nbut comes with increased electricity demand. If projections \nwere conducted in an integrated way, these changes would \nalready be reflected in the energy supply\u00a0sector.\n\nCertain hard-to-electrify sectors, such as heavy industry and \nheavy-duty and long-distance transport such as shipping or \naviation, will also require a cleaner fuel system. For instance, \nrenewable hydrogen, a carrier of renewable energy that is \nenergy intensive to produce, will mainly represent an option \nfor areas that are difficult to decarbonise through direct \nelectrification. Other sectors have also expressed a desire \nfor renewable hydrogen, where other and more affordable \noptions are often available and where a continued use of gas, \nfor example if renewable hydrogen is blended into natural gas \nnetworks, may delay changes in infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, the emission mitigation possibilities in sectors \npartly overlap, and this can lead to new competing uses \nof resources in the short term. For example, sustainable \nuse of biomass is an important ingredient for successful \ndecarbonisation and, in several Member States, for achieving \ntheir national objectives on renewable energy use. But \nbiomass can also be used for other purposes \u2014 in wood \nproducts and in construction, for example. While the use of \nbiomass for energy supply generates immediate emissions, \nwood products and construction conserve biomass and keep \nthe embedded carbon out of circulation for extended periods. \nAt the same time, sustainably sourcing woody biomass limits \nits availability and raises competition. This calls for cascading \nbiomass use and prioritising which woody biomass should be \nused and for what purposes (BTG Biomass Technology Group \net al., 2016; JRC, 2021b).\n\nTo consider sector coupling and upcoming competition \nchallenges, a more integrated approach to sectors and \nenergy carriers would contribute to ensuring that change \ncan happen at the necessary pace. Steps in this direction \nhave already been made. An EU strategy for energy system \nintegration was presented on 8\u00a0July 2020 and recognises \nthe need for coupling energy carriers with each other \nand with end use sectors, as well as the importance of \ncreating a level playing field (EC, 2020b). Taking a holistic \nview on integration requires several characteristics of the \nclimate and energy area to be considered in parallel and \ninterdependently \u2014 namely coupling, challenging shifts \nand competition\u00a0coherently.\n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends at the sectoral level \n\n28 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nFurther reading\n\nEEA indicators:\n\n\u2022 New registrations of electric vehicles in Europe\n\n\u2022 Greenhouse gas emission intensity of fuels and biofuels for road transport\n\n\u2022 CO2 performance of new passenger cars in Europe\n\n\u2022 CO2 performance of new vans in Europe\n\n\u2022 Share of energy consumption from renewable sources in Europe\n\n\u2022 Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in Europe\n\n\u2022 Greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF in Europe\n\nOther sources:\n\n\u2022 CASCADES: Study on the optimised cascading use of wood\n\n\u2022 The use of woody biomass for energy production in the EU, JRC, 2020\n\n\u2022 Powering a climate-neutral economy: an EU strategy for energy system integration\n\n\u2022 New European Bauhaus: Commission launches design phase\n\n\u2022 Green hydrogen, IRENA, 2020\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/proportion-of-vehicle-fleet-meeting-5/assessment\f\n29Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n3 \nGreenhouse gas emissions \n\nand energy trends in \nEuropean countries\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 While the 2020 targets appear to have been met at EU level, several countries' particularly strong \noverachievements were enough to make up for a lack of achievement in others. In total, 11 countries (Croatia, \nCzechia, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) performed well across \nall target areas and stayed within their 2020 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption limits, \nwhile also meeting or exceeding their 2020 renewable energy share target.\n\n \u2013 In 2020, total GHG emissions decreased in all Member States compared with 2019, according to approximated data. \nA total of 21 EU countries (all except Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Ireland and Malta) reported approximated \nGHG\u00a0emissions in 2020 that were below their national targets under the Effort Sharing legislation. Some Member \nStates (Bulgaria, Czechia and Romania) appeared to have higher emissions in 2020 under the Effort Sharing legislation \nthan in 2019 due to emissions from the energy and industry sector that are not covered under the EU Emissions \nTrading System.\n\n \u2013 Estimates indicate that a total of 22 countries met or exceeded their 2020 renewable energy share target without \nthe use of statistical transfers. The remaining five countries (Belgium, France, Poland, Romania and Slovenia) \nfailed to meet their target shares of renewables in 2020. Several of these Member States have agreed on statistical \ntransfers with other Member States that have a renewables surplus; these are not reflected here.\n\n \u2013 In the area of energy efficiency, estimates show that 20 Member States reduced their final energy consumption enough \nto reach levels below their 2020 indicative targets. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia \nappear not to have achieved their 2020 indicative targets, even given the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n \u2013 While no countries failed to achieve any of their 2020 targets, two countries appear to have underperformed on \nthree of their four 2020 targets. Preliminary data show that Belgium and Bulgaria achieved only one 2020 target: \nGHG emission reductions in Belgium and renewable energy share in Bulgaria.\n\n\u2022 Looking towards 2030, continued and greater efforts will be needed by the majority of European countries. Some \nhave already demonstrated preliminary 2020 emission levels that meet their 2030 target levels: \n\n \u2013 Croatia, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia already have GHG emissions levels that are below their current \nEffort Sharing legislation emission limits for 2030.\n\n \u2013 Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Romania and Slovenia have final \nenergy consumption levels below those envisaged for 2030.\n\n \u2013 Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, \nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia had primary energy levels that were below the level foreseen for 2030.\n\n \u2013 No country has renewable energy shares at or above the contribution levels that they have set for 2030.\n\n       These countries will need to maintain their progress throughout the coming decade as they work to reach their national \n       targets for 2030 \u2014 and also during their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in European countries \n\n30 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nWhile Chapter 2 reviewed progress in individual sectors and \nhighlighted substantial sectoral shifts in selected European \ncountries, this chapter looks more broadly at progress in all \nthe EU countries.\n\nFigure 3.1 shows how EU countries fare today with respect \nto their 2020 and 2030 targets and contributions in the \nareas of Effort Sharing legislation emissions, renewable \nenergy shares, and energy efficiency targets for final and \nprimary energy consumption. Under the Energy Efficiency \nDirective, countries set their own national, non-binding \ntargets based on primary or final energy consumption, \non primary or final energy savings, or on energy intensity. \nThe directive requires that Member States also express \nthose targets in terms of absolute levels of primary and \nfinal energy consumption, which are both presented \nin\u00a0Figure\u00a03.1.\n\nIn Figure 3.1, for Effort Sharing legislation emissions and \nenergy efficiency, the target or contribution is considered to \nbe met when the coloured bar is at or below the target or \ncontribution.

The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) targets for 2030 have been published using global warming \npotentials from the Fifth Assessment Report. To allow a comparison with reported greenhouse gas projections and historical inventory \nnumbers, we estimated annual emission allocations for 2021-2030 using Global Warming potentials from the Fourth Assessment Report. \n\nSources: EC (2020c), EEA (forthcoming_a, 2021b, forthcoming_b, forthcoming_c), Eurostat (2021c, 2021d). \n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in European countries \n\n32 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n3.1 National greenhouse gas emissions \n\nEU Member States need to limit a share of their GHG \nemissions (those currently not covered by the EU Emissions \nTrading System) in accordance with national targets set in the \nEffort Sharing legislation and spelled out in annual emission \nallocations. These national annual allocations comprise an \nannual emission target for each Member State for each year \nfrom 2013 to 2020 and from 2021 to 2030. \n\nIn 2019, 17 countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, \nDenmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, \nthe\u00a0Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain \nand Sweden) exhibited Effort Sharing emissions that were below \ntheir emission target for that year. \n\nPreliminary data for 2020 indicate that 21 EU countries (all except \nBulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Ireland and Malta) had 2020 \nEffort Sharing legislation emissions that were below their 2020 \nnational emission targets. This means that, despite the effects of \nthe COVID-19 crisis, these six Member States still failed to reduce \nor limit their emissions below their 2020 target levels.\n\nThe original EU-wide 2030 target of 40\u00a0%, compared with \n1990 levels, was translated into a reduction in Effort Sharing \n\n(4) The gaps were calculated according to the following formula: (2030 ESR target\u00a0-\u00a02019 ESR emissions)\u00a0/\u00a02030 ESR target, where ESR is Effort \nSharing Regulation. \n\nemissions of 30\u00a0% in 2030 compared with 2005. In 2021, \nthe European Climate Law raised the overall EU ambition \nfor 2030, and an amended Effort Sharing Regulation is \nproposed to help deliver on this ambition through a total \nreduction in Effort Sharing emissions of 40\u00a0% by 2030 \ncompared with 2005. \n\nThe current national 2030 Effort Sharing legislation targets \nrange from 0\u00a0% (Bulgaria) to -40\u00a0% (Luxembourg and \nSweden) compared with the base-year levels in 2005. No \ncountry has a target that would permit an increase in \nemission levels. In 2019, the gaps\u00a0(4) between the national \n2030 Effort Sharing targets and actual emission levels \nranged from 76\u00a0% above the national target (Malta) to 15\u00a0% \nbelow the national target (Greece). In addition, Croatia's \nemissions were already lower in 2019, by 3\u00a0%, than their \nnational 2030\u00a0targets. \n\nOn 14\u00a0July 2021, the European Commission proposed a \nrevision of national Effort Sharing legislation targets and \nannual emission allocations for the period 2021-2030 to \nreflect the increased ambition for 2030 and to continue to \nrecognise Member States' different capacities to take action. \nThe proposed national targets range from 10\u00a0% to 50\u00a0% \nbelow 2005 levels.\n\nFurther reading\n\nEEA indicators:\n\n\u2022 Progress to national greenhouse gas emission targets in Europe\n\nOther sources:\n\n\u2022 Delivering the European Green Deal\n\n\u2022 Proposal to revise the Effort Sharing legislation\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/progress-towards-national-greenhouse-gas/assessment\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in European countries \n\n33Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n3.2 National renewable energy shares\n\nFor the period up to 2020, national, binding targets for shares \nof energy from renewable sources \u2014 known as 'RES shares'\u00a0\u2014 \nwere set in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). European \nMember States also anticipated their respective RES share \npaths to 2020 in their national renewable energy action plans \n(NREAPs). \n\nFor 2030, the national energy and climate plans (NECPs) indicate \nhow Member States intend to contribute to the EU-wide RES \ntarget. The European Commission's assessment of the NECPs \nfinds that, at EU level, the combined commitments of the \nMember States will lead to a total RES share in 2030 of between \n33.1\u00a0% and 33.7 %, which is consistent with the 32\u00a0% target \n(EC,\u00a02020c). \n\nIn most of the European Member States, as well as Iceland \nand Norway, RES shares increased, albeit at different speeds, \nbetween 2005 and 2019. Differences between RES shares and \ntargets presented in Figure 3.1 highlight the need for statistical \ntransfers, which need to be conducted for compliance with \nthe RED for the year 2020 if countries' RES shares are lower \nthan targets. The following two examples show how these \ndevelopments can vary.\n\nHungary exhibited its greatest RES share in 2013, with a total of \n16.2\u00a0%. Since then, Hungary's RES share has decreased steadily \nand stood at 12.6\u00a0% in 2019. The reason for this decline can be \nfound in Hungary's growth in energy consumption, which has \noutpaced its growth in renewables. Although Hungary's share of \nrenewables increased in the electricity sector, its RES share for \nheating and cooling declined, and the net result is a decline in \nthe total RES share.\n\nSlovakia increased its RES share by a full 5 percentage points \nbetween 2018 and 2019. In this period, Slovakia's renewable \nenergy consumption in heating and cooling nearly doubled, \nmainly due to the increased use of biomass, following \nchanges in the national method for collecting data on energy \nconsumption of biomass. 2019 was also the first year in which \nheat pumps were accounted for, although this technology \nhad been used in Slovakia before then. Overall, this shift in \naccounting method gave the country's RES share a one-time \nstatistical boost and a remarkable 5 percentage point increase \nin a single year. \n\nAcross Europe, the use of biomass as a renewable source \nfor heating and cooling purposes as defined by the RED is \n\nwidespread, comprising 16\u00a0% of gross final energy consumption \nfor heating and cooling in 2019 in the 27 EU Member States. \nAs the potential for using biomass is restricted in the EU and \nLand Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation \ntargets need to be achieved, there are limits on any further \nlarge increases in this sector. In 2019, more than 35\u00a0% of gross \nfinal energy consumption for heating and cooling came from \nbiomass in Latvia (42\u00a0%), Finland (41\u00a0%) and Sweden (35\u00a0%) \n(Eurostat, 2021c). The sustainability requirements for biomass \nin the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED\u00a0II) are applicable \nfrom July 2021 and aim to ensure an overall balance in the use \nof this resource for energy purposes. \n\nIn contrast, the use of heat pumps started from low levels \nin 2005, and several Member States have increased their \nuptake of heat pumps continually and significantly since \nthen. The three countries with highest shares of energy from \nheat pumps in gross final energy consumption for heating \nand cooling in 2019 are Malta (16 %), Portugal (11\u00a0%) and \nSweden\u00a0(10\u00a0%).\n\nIn terms of progress to targets, 14 EU countries (Bulgaria, \nCroatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, \nItaly, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden), as well \nas Iceland and Norway, achieved national RES shares in 2019 \nthat surpassed their 2020 national targets in the RED. In all \nEU countries except five (Belgium, France, Poland, Romania \nand Slovenia), the estimated national RES share in 2020 had \nprogressed above the national 2020 target set in the RED. \n\nMeanwhile, according to national trajectories set in the NREAPs, \n14 EU countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, \nEstonia, Finland, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia and Sweden), as well as Iceland and Norway, reached \nor exceeded their anticipated RES levels in 2019. In 2020, \n17\u00a0countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, \nFinland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \nMalta, Portugal, Slovakia and Sweden), as well as Iceland and \nNorway, reached or exceeded the anticipated 2020 RES level \nstated in their NREAP.\n\nYet, there is still a long way to go to achieve the RES \ncontributions set by countries for 2030 in their NECPs, which \nindicates that sources of renewable energy need to increase \nsignificantly this decade. Distances from the RES contributions \nfor 2030 range from 24 percentage points above the 2019 \nRES share (in Spain, whose 2030 contribution is a 42.0 % RES \nshare) to only 2 percentage points above the 2019 RES share (in \nSlovakia, whose 2030 contribution is a 19.2\u00a0% RES share)\u00a0(5). \n\n(5) Compared with 2020 RES share estimates, distances from the 2030 national RES share contributions range from +25 percentage points \n(Denmark, whose 2030 contribution is a 55\u00a0% RES shares) to +1 percentage point (Malta, whose 2030 contribution is 12\u00a0%). \n\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in European countries \n\n34 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n3.3 National energy consumption levels \n\nBetween 2005 and 2019, final energy consumption decreased \nin 19 EU countries and increased in eight (Austria, Cyprus, \nEstonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Poland). The \ngreatest increases were observed in Malta (+50.6\u00a0%) and Poland \n(+21.3\u00a0%) and are largely explained by the strong growth in \ntransport demand in both countries (+53\u00a0% in Malta and +86\u00a0% \nin Poland) and in the services sector in Malta (+105\u00a0% between \n2005 and 2019) (Eurostat, 2021a).\n\nUnder the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), EU-27 countries \nset their own national, non-binding targets for energy \nefficiency for 2020. These targets could be based on primary \nor final energy consumption, on primary or final energy \nsavings, or on energy intensity. National indicative 2020 \ntargets for final energy consumption set by Member States \nrange from -14.8\u00a0% (Bulgaria) to +36.5\u00a0% (Malta), compared \nwith 2005 levels (EC, 2021c). A\u00a0total of 21 countries set targets \nto decrease their final energy consumption, while six countries \n(Cyprus, Finland, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Romania) set \ntargets that are higher than their 2005 final consumption \nlevels. Countries' frequent revisions of their voluntary targets \nfor 2020, especially in recent years, created challenges for \nthe transparent and consistent evaluation of national and EU \nprogress towards the 2020\u00a0targets.\n\nAs of 2019, 14 Member States were in line with or below their \n2020 indicative targets for final energy consumption (see \nFigure 3.1). However, the remaining 13 (Austria, Belgium, \nBulgaria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, \nLuxembourg, Malta, Slovakia and Sweden) had not reduced \n\nFurther reading\n\nEEA indicators:\n\n\u2022 Share of energy consumption from renewable sources in Europe\n\nOther sources:\n\n\u2022 An EU-wide assessment of national energy and climate plans\n\n\u2022 Renewable Energy Directive\n\n\u2022 Delivering the European Green Deal\n\ntheir final energy consumption enough to reach levels below \ntheir 2020 indicative targets.\n\nBased on the preliminary data for 2020, a combination of \nfactors, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, \nindicates that the aforementioned 14 Member States, as well \nas five additional (Estonia, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and \nSweden), are expected to have reached their final energy \nconsumption targets in 2020. \n\nIn 2019, 15 Member States were in line with or below their 2020 \nindicative targets for primary energy consumption; this was not \nthe case in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, \nIreland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and \nSweden\u00a0(6). In 2020, based on preliminary data, nine additional \ncountries were estimated to be in line with or below their 2020 \ntarget (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, \nMalta, Poland and Sweden.)\n\nSimilar to the 2020 targets, EU-27 countries set their own \nnational, non-binding contributions for energy efficiency in \n2030 in their NECPs (EC, 2020c). Together, their intended \ncontributions to the 2030 energy efficiency targets total \n1\u00a0176\u00a0million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) for primary \nenergy consumption and 885\u00a0Mtoe for final energy \nconsumption, in comparison with the current EU 2030 targets \nof 1\u00a0128\u00a0Mtoe for primary energy and 846\u00a0Mtoe for final \nenergy consumption. This collective effort to reduce energy \nconsumption is not sufficient to reach the EU's 2030 target of \nreducing energy consumption by at least 32.5\u00a0% \u2014 a target \nthat has not yet been adjusted to account for the increased \nambition for 2030 emission reductions. \n\n(6) Sweden has opted for an energy intensity target in which the assumed levels of growth in both gross domestic product (GDP) and energy \nconsumption impacts the target level. The country may still reach its 2020 target, subject to final official figures for energy consumption \nand\u00a0GDP.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/renewable-gross-final-energy-consumption-5/assessment\f\nGreenhouse gas emissions and energy trends in European countries \n\n35Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nTwenty Member States intend to reduce their national \nfinal energy consumption levels compared with 2019, with \nreductions ranging from 0.9\u00a0% (Croatia) to 30.3\u00a0% (Luxembourg). \nThe remaining seven Member States had final energy \nconsumption levels in 2019 that were below their contributions \nto final energy consumption in 2030 (Bulgaria, Cyprus, \nDenmark, Greece, Hungary, Malta and Romania). For\u00a0primary \n\nenergy, the 2030 contributions result in decreases in \nconsumption compared with 2019 levels in 19 Member States, \nranging from 1.8\u00a0% (Slovakia) to 26.6\u00a0% (the Netherlands). \nEight Member States had primary energy consumption levels \nin 2019 that were below their respective 2030 contributions \n(Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Malta \nand Romania).\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated indicators:\n\n\u2022 Primary and final energy consumption in Europe\n\n\u2022 Share of energy consumption from renewable sources in Europe\n\nOther sources:\n\n\u2022 An EU-wide assessment of national energy and climate plans\n\n\u2022 Effort sharing: Member States' emission targets\n\n\u2022 Energy Efficiency Directive\n\n\u2022 Renewable Energy Directive\n\n\u2022 Delivering the European Green Deal\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/final-energy-consumption-by-sector-12/assessment\f\nIncreasing the ambition of\u00a0the\u00a02030 targets \n\n36 Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n\u00a9 Veeterzy, on Unsplash\n\f\n37Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\n4 \nIncreasing the ambition \n\nof\u00a0the\u00a02030 targets\n\nThe analysis of progress towards achieving the 2030 targets \npresented in this report is based on the targets for the EU \nEmissions Trading System (ETS), greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions under the Effort Sharing legislation, and renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency that were set to support a 40 % \nreduction in total emissions by 2030. Total emission levels, \nhowever, are aligned with the new net 55\u00a0% reduction target \nadopted in 2021 under the European Climate Law. The \nincreased ambition of a net 55\u00a0% reduction requires a review of \nthe current legislation and agreement on new targets for 2030 \nin individual sectors and new target for renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency. \n\nTo this end, the European Commission published a package of \nproposals and accompanying impact assessments in July 2021 \n(EC, 2021a). The proposed changes include: \n\n\u2022 an increase in emission reductions in the EU\u00a0ETS from 43\u00a0% \nto 62 %, inclusion of emissions from maritime transport \nbetween EU countries and 50\u00a0% of emissions from voyages \nto and from the EU, and establishment of a second ETS for \nroad transport and buildings as of 2026, with 25\u00a0% of the \nrevenues flowing into a new social climate fund;\n\n\u2022 an increase in emission reductions under the Effort Sharing \nRegulation from 30\u00a0% to 40\u00a0%, with a revision of Member \nState targets;\n\n\u2022 the setting of an EU-wide target of a land use, land use \nchange and forestry (LULUCF) sink of 310\u00a0Mt carbon dioxide \nequivalent (CO2e) in 2030, which is divided into national \ntargets, allocating targeted net emission levels for each \nMember State;\n\n\u2022 the implementation of a Carbon Border Adjustment \nMechanism (CBAM), initially covering cement, iron, steel, \naluminium, fertiliser and electricity;\n\n\u2022 stronger CO2 emission standards for cars and vans, \nrequiring average emissions of new cars to fall by 55\u00a0% from \n\n2030 and 100\u00a0% from 2035 compared with 2021 levels, and \nall new cars registered as of 2035 to have zero emissions; \nand\n\n\u2022 a portfolio of measures to address aviation emissions, \nincluding phasing out of free allocation under the EU\u00a0ETS, \nquotas for sustainable aviation fuels to be achieved at \nsingle airports, and a minimum tax on\u00a0kerosene.\n\nWith the higher level of ambition for GHG targets, energy \ntargets will have to be adapted too. This could result in an \nincrease in the aggregated EU target for energy from renewable \nsources from 32 % to 40\u00a0% without setting binding targets \nfor Member States. Like renewable energy targets, energy \nefficiency targets will become binding at EU level. A decrease \nin energy consumption of 36-39\u00a0% in 2030 compared with \nthe baseline projection for 2007, is proposed to replace the \ncurrent target of 32.5\u00a0% (EC, 2021b). It is further proposed to \nput in place a formula for indicative energy efficiency targets \nfor Member States and to implement a gap-filling mechanism \nif the EU target is at risk of not being achieved. Additional \nrevisions of relevant regulations and directives should support \nthese overarching targets, such as the upcoming revision of the \nEnergy Performance Buildings Directive.\n\nTo better align the climate mitigation and energy targets with \nenergy sources, subsidies for fossil fuels are scheduled to be \ndiscontinued (OECD, 2021). The proposed revision the Energy \nTaxation Directive and the EU taxonomy for sustainable \nactivities, which is intended to facilitate more sustainable \ninvestment in Europe, could contribute to this (EU, 2020). \n\nUnder the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union \nand Climate Action, Member States are set to update their \nnational energy and climate plans in 2023 and 2024, which \nwill provide an opportunity to set new national targets and \ndefine new national contributions for 2030. This will help to \nensure broad alignment with the more rapid pace of change in \nemissions and developments in renewable energy and energy \nefficiency that the more ambitious 2030 targets will require. \n\f\f\n39Trends and projections in Europe 2021\n\nAbbreviations\n\nCO2 Carbon dioxide\n\nCO2e Carbon dioxide equivalent\n\nEEA European Environment Agency\n\nEED Energy Efficiency

Key to this is reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including from agriculture. Agricultural GHG emissions are covered by the EU Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) and Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which set annual targets for each Member State for the periods 2013-2020 and 2021-2030, respectively . Emissions from transport, buildings and waste are also covered by national ESD and ESR targets, which collectively aim to reduce total EU emissions from the sectors covered by around 10% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.\nCH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and N2O emissions from soils are responsible for more than 80% of total agricultural GHG emissions. CH4 from manure management is the third most important source of emissions, accounting for about 10%. The remaining sources make relatively small contributions, accounting for less than 10% of agricultural GHG emissions in total.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, the EU\u2019s agricultural GHG emissions changed very little, and this trend is expected to continue, with Member State projections indicating that there will be only a modest 2% decline in agricultural GHG emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. If additional measures currently planned by Member States are implemented, this would increase to a decline of 5%.\nBased on these projected reductions in agricultural emissions, Member States will have to achieve much greater reductions in other ESR sectors if they are to meet national targets. A European Commission impact assessment highlights the challenges in further reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions from agriculture . Measures commonly supported by the common agricultural policy have not been effective so far, while support for some effective measures, including the use of foraged legumes, and improved manure treatment and fertiliser application, has been sporadic . Reducing EU production, especially of livestock, would directly reduce agricultural GHG emissions. However, to avoid \u2018leakage\u2019 of emissions to outside the EU, this would need to be matched by a decrease in EU demand, through less food waste and a shift in diet away from meat and dairy towards plant-based protein sources .\n|Country||2005-2019||Projected 2005-2030 with existing measures||Projected 2005-2030 with additional measures|\n|Croatia||-17.7||-20.5||-25.4|\n|Malta||-16.6||-27.9||-27.9|\n|Greece||-11.9||2.1||2.1|\n|Italy||-8.7||-13.4||-13.4|\n|Romania||-8.1||5.6||2|\n|France||-4.4||-7.2||-7.2|\n|Belgium||-4||-7.9||-18.1|\n|Cyprus||-3.9||-8.4||-8.9|\n|Denmark||-2.7||-8.2||-8.2|\n|Germany||-2.3||-9.5||-9.5|\n|Spain||-2.3||-5.6||-16.5|\n|EU-27||-1.8||-2||-5|\n|Sweden||-1.4||-13.3||-13.3|\n|Czechia||-0.6||1.4||1.4|\n|Netherlands||-0.2||-0.6||-1.3|\n|Sloveia||0.3||5.1||-0.8|\n|Finland||1.4||-2.1||-9.6|\n|Austria||1.9||3.6||-6.4|\n|Poland||2.5||3||3|\n|Portugal||2.7||-1.8||-4.4|\n|Lithuania||4.7||-0.2||-8.1|\n|Slovakia||5.6||-5.6||-5.6|\n|Ireland||6.2||10.1||-5.1|\n|Luxembourg||10.2||5.8||-18.9|\n|Hungary||16.2||22.4||14.4|\n|Latvia||22.8||54.2||44.4|\n|Bulgaria||24.7||48.1||48.1|\n|Estonia||27||32.8||32.8|\nAlthough agricultural GHG emissions changed very little at the EU level between 2005 and 2019, trends varied widely at the national level, with emissions increasing in 14 and decreasing in 13 Member States. For instance, emissions decreased by more than 10% in Croatia, Greece and Malta, and increased by more than 10 % in Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Luxembourg.\nBased on projections, most Member States anticipate a continuation of past trends if existing measures remain in place. However, some Member States anticipate a reversal of trends.

Between 2005 and 2019, agricultural emissions remained stable. Based on national projections, only a modest EU-level decline of 2% is expected by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. If currently planned additional measures are implemented, a 5% reduction is expected. These projected declines would be insufficient to meet most Member States\u2019 binding annual targets, highlighting the need for further action if the EU is to meet its goal of climate neutrality by 2050.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||Energy consumption from agriculture/forestry/fishing||CH4 from enteric fermentation||Manure management||N2O from agricultural soils||Other||Total agriculture (excl. energy) with additional measures||Total agriculture (excl. energy) with existing measures|\n|2005||84||168||61||151||13|\n|2006||81||167||61||149||13|\n|2007||79||168||61||151||14|\n|2008||79||167||59||150||13|\n|2009||78||166||59||147||13|\n|2010||80||164||57||147||13|\n|2011||78||162||57||147||14|\n|2012||76||162||56||147||14|\n|2013||76||163||55||150||15|\n|2014||75||164||56||154||15|\n|2015||74||166||57||153||15|\n|2016||75||166||56||154||15|\n|2017||75||166||56||157||15|\n|2018||77||166||56||154||15|\n|2019||77||164||56||152||14||389||389|\n|2020||387||388|\n|2021||385||387|\n|2022||384||387|\n|2023||383||387|\n|2024||381||386|\n|2025||380||386|\n|2026||379||386|\n|2027||377||386|\n|2028||376||385|\n|2029||375||385|\n|2030||373||385|\n|2031||373||385|\n|2032||373||385|\n|2033||372||385|\n|2034||372||385|\n|2035||372||385|\n|2036||372||385|\n|2037||371||385|\n|2038||371||385|\n|2039||371||385|\n|2040||371||385|\n|2041|\n|2042|\n|2043|\n|2044|\n|2045|\n|2046|\n|2047|\n|2048|\n|2049|\n|2050|\nThe European Green Deal sets out the EU\u2019s ambition to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. Key to this is reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including from agriculture. Agricultural GHG emissions are covered by the EU Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) and Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which set annual targets for each Member State for the periods 2013-2020 and 2021-2030, respectively . Emissions from transport, buildings and waste are also covered by national ESD and ESR targets, which collectively aim to reduce total EU emissions from the sectors covered by around 10% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.\nCH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and N2O emissions from soils are responsible for more than 80% of total agricultural GHG emissions. CH4 from manure management is the third most important source of emissions, accounting for about 10%. The remaining sources make relatively small contributions, accounting for less than 10% of agricultural GHG emissions in total.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, the EU\u2019s agricultural GHG emissions changed very little, and this trend is expected to continue, with Member State projections indicating that there will be only a modest 2% decline in agricultural GHG emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. If additional measures currently planned by Member States are implemented, this would increase to a decline of 5%.\nBased on these projected reductions in agricultural emissions, Member States will have to achieve much greater reductions in other ESR sectors if they are to meet national targets.

This Executive \nSummary includes an analysis of the important changes in GHG emissions across the EU, by sector and \nby Member State. \n\nMain findings \n\nFor EU27 the emissions have decreased by 293.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, or 8.1 % (total GHG \nemissions without LULUCF, including indirect CO2, without international aviation) between 2019 and \n2020. International aviation equalled for EU27 to 60.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2020, which is \nabout 54.3 % lower than in 2019. Emissions including international aviation across the EU27 decreased \nby 9.8 % compared to 2019. This is a reduction of 31.4 % when compared to 1990. Table ES.1 provides \ndetails on the total levels of emissions including international aviation.  \n \nIt is important to note that emissions reductions within the EU have two main reasons. The first one is \nthe reduction in economic activity due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the second one is continuing trend of \nemissions decreases which started in previous years. ETS emissions (mostly covering emissions from \nelectricity and heat production) have decreased more than the ESD emissions. \n \nThe changes in 2020 are caused by number of reasons, whereby is important to mention increase in use \nof renewable sources for electricity generation and change of fossil fuels to natural gas due to the high \ncarbon and fuel coal prices. Changes in the fuels consumed in 2020 doesn\u2019t follow the weather \nconditions as much as in previous years. \n \nThe emission estimates for 2020 are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as by several other \nfactors that are explained below.   \n \n \n\nTable ES.1  Emissions including international aviation (kt CO2 eq.) \n\nEuropean Union (EU27) 1990 2019 2020 2020-2019 2020/2019 2020-1990 2020/1990 \n\nTotal excl.

Emissions levelled off \nbetween 2014 and 2017 (Figure ES.1), and the estimate for 2020 shows a 9.8 % decrease compared to \n2019 emissions level.  \n \nFor EU27 the 2020 emissions are estimated to be 3377 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents (Mt CO2 eq.), \nwhich indicates a decrease from 2019 of 365 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents (Mt CO2 eq.), or 9.8 %.  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 3 \n\n \n \n\nFigure ES.1  Trends in total GHG emissions, 1990-2020 \n\n \nNote: Total GHG emissions without LULUCF including indirect CO2 and international aviation \nSource:  The EEA\u2019s ETC/CME, based on the 2021 Member States\u2019 GHG inventories submitted to UNFCCC for the years 1990\n2019 and proxy estimates for 2020. \n\n \n \nThe trend shows 9.8 % decrease in emissions for the EU27 (total with international aviation) since 2019 \nand the GDP growth is correspondingly showing negative trend of 6.1 % in the same year (Figure ES.2).

Data for UK are available through \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-section-7-weather  \n\n \n \nClimatic factors have a significant effect on energy demand and GHG emission trends. The exceptionally \nwarm years were 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The year 2020 was the warmest year for \nEurope (Copernicus, 2021). Furthermore, the warmest winter for 2019/2020 was noted. On the other \nhand, winter 2020/2021 was close to 1991-2020 average. The pattern in heating degree days (a \nstandardized measure for linking heating demand and weather conditions) confirms slightly lower \nheating demand in 2020 compared to 2019. The highest amount of cooling degree days in 2020 was \nobserved for Cyprus, Malta and Greece, as it is to be expected for these countries. Figure ES 2 also shows \nthat in the 11 Member States heating degree days increased while total emissions decreased. Therefore, \nthe correlation between amount of heating degree days and total emissions is not very significant for \nmany Member states. \n \nChanges in EU GHG emissions by sector \n \nOn a sectoral basis, the largest absolute emission decrease in the EU occurred in the energy sector (i.e. \nall combustion activities and fugitive emissions). Energy related emissions decreased by 271 Mt CO2 eq. \n(-9.8 %) across the EU. Within the energy sector, emissions decreased in all categories. The most \nsignificant decrease is for energy industries (\u2212118 Mt CO2 eq.), which are followed by transport (\u2212106 Mt \nCO2 eq.).  Fugitive emissions from fuels decreased as well (-2 Mt CO2 eq.).  \n \nThese changes in emissions in 2020 reflect large changes in the fuel mix. Primary fossil energy \nconsumption decreased again in 2020, and the contribution of coal to the energy mix decreased in 2020 \nwhile the share of gas and renewable fuels increased. Wind and solar contributed the most to the \nincrease in renewable electricity, solid biofuels decreased slightly while hydro stayed stagnant. Primary \nenergy consumption of nuclear energy decreased as well as its contribution to the energy mix.  \n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-section-7-weather\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 5 \n\nThe consumption of all fossil fuels; solid, liquid and gaseous; decreased in 2020. The consumption of \ngaseous fuels decreased by 2.2 % while consumption of liquid fuels decreased significantly by 11.8 % and \nsolid fossil fuels consumption fell significantly as well by 19.1 % (EEA 2021c)1. \n \nThe emissions from the sector Industrial Processes and Product Use decreased by 5.7 % between 2019 \nand 2020 in the EU27. The largest contribution to this emission decrease was from metal industry, which \ndecreased by 13.1 %. \n \nAgriculture emissions decreased by 0.4 % mainly due to emission decreases from enteric fermentation, \nand also agricultural soils, other carbon containing fertilisers, manure management and liming. \n \nThe trend in emissions from waste (\u22121.2 % compared to previous year) continues the decrease seen in \nprevious years with largest reduction being in emissions from solid waste disposal. \n \nReporting under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation requires separate detail for the EU ETS and nonETS sectors. Between 2019 and 2020 the emissions decreased by 11.6 % across stationary installations \ncovered by the European Emissions Trading System for the EU, whereas emissions covered by the Effort \nSharing Decision (ESD) decreased by 5.6 %. \n \n\nChanges in member state\u2019s GHG emissions \n \nGreenhouse gas emissions decreased in all EU Member States in 2020. Figure ES.3 depicts the regional \ndistribution of these changes which differ significantly between different regions. \n \n\n \n\nFigure ES.3  Regional trends in total GHG emissions change 2019-2020 \n\n \n \n\n                                                           \n(1)  ETC 2021, energy efficiency proxy 2020   \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 6 \n\n \n\nComparing the changes across Member States (Figure ES.4), the largest absolute emission change \noccurred in Germany, where emissions decreased by 70 Mt CO2 eq. Apparent decrease in emissions \noccurred also for Spain (-43 Mt CO2 eq.), France (-40 Mt CO2 eq.), Italy (-36 Mt CO2 eq.), Poland (-17 Mt \nCO2 eq.) and the Netherlands (-16 Mt CO2 eq.).  \n \nThe largest relative declines were in Estonia (-21.2%) and Luxembourg (\u221214.0 %).  \n \nIn the non-EU member countries of the EEA, emissions decreased in Switzerland (-5.8 %, or -3 Mt CO2 \neq.), Norway (-2.1 % or -1 Mt CO2 eq.) and Iceland (-5.0 % or -0.2 Mt CO2 eq.).  \n \n\n \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 7 \n\nFigure ES.4  Member States\u2019 emissions, change 2019-2020 \n\n \n \n \n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 8 \n\n1 Background and objective \n\nThis approximated GHG inventory is an early estimate of the GHG emissions for the preceding year. The \nlegal basis for the approximated GHG emission estimates is Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European \nParliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. Article 26(2) \nrequires Member States to submit to the Commission approximated greenhouse gas inventories for the \nyear t-1 by 31 July every year. Iceland is not an EU Member State but has to report its approximated \ninventory, where possible, as any other EU Member State. The European Environment Agency (EEA) \nassists the Commission in the compilation of the Union approximated greenhouse gas inventory. These \nestimates are referred to as approximated ('proxy') estimates or inventories as they cover the year for \nwhich no official GHG inventories have been prepared. Should a Member State not provide their own \nproxy emission estimate, the EEA produces and uses gap-filled estimates in order to have a complete \napproximated GHG inventory for the European Union. Non-EU member countries of the EEA are invited \nto submit their proxy estimates on a voluntary basis.  \n \nThe scope of the proxy estimates covers total GHG emissions, for all gases, sectors, and Member States, \nas reported under the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC excluding the land use, land-use change and \nforestry (LULUCF) sector but including indirect CO2. \n \nMember States are responsible for the methodological choice regarding their own estimates. For gapfilling where a Member State has not provided their own estimate the EEA has used the latest Eurostat \nand EU ETS data to carry forward reported emissions from the energy and industrial processes sectors. \nThese two source categories typically account for the bulk of emissions and have the largest annual \nchange. The agriculture and waste sectors are set to repeat the previous year\u2019s values. The estimates \nassume no change in emission factors or methodologies as compared to the latest official inventory \nsubmissions to the UNFCCC for the year t-2. International aviation was gap-filled, in case reporting \ncountries have not reported the data. The gap-filling procedure used flight and emission data provided \nby Eurocontrol. \n \nThe EU is aiming to have a leading role in the emission reduction and for this purpose a number of \nmeasures have been adopted. One of the most important measures is the Effort Sharing Decision, which \ncovers sectors of the economy which fall outside the scope of the EU Emission Trading Scheme. These \nsectors, which include transport, buildings, agriculture, non-ETS industry and waste, account up to 60 % \nof the total EU emissions (EU 2018). \n \nThe official submission of 2020 inventories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) will take place in 2022.  \n \nTable 1.1 provides an overview of different emission estimates by EU bodies.

The methodologies used for any gap-filling are \ndescribed in chapter 4.4.1. \n \nThese 25 countries that submitted 2020 proxy estimates represent more than 95 % of EU27 total \nemissions. \n \nThe EEA used gap-filled estimates for Bulgaria in order to have a complete approximated GHG inventory \nfor the European Union (section 4.3). \n \nAdditionally three EEA member countries submitted preliminary 2020 GHG data by 31 July 2021: Iceland, \nSwitzerland and Norway.3 \n \nApproximated GHG inventories in CRF Summary2 table format are presented for the EU27 in chapter   \n2.1.5. Annex 1: Detailed results for each Member State provides the CRF Summary2 tables for each of \nthe 27 EU Member States and also for Iceland, Switzerland and Norway. \n\n2.1 Trend and overall results \n\n2.1.1 Changes in GHG emissions across the EU \n\nThe estimates for 2020 indicate the decreasing trend of emissions reduction. Emissions levelled off \nbetween 2014 and 2017 (Figure 2.1), and the estimate for 2020 shows 9.8 % decrease compared to 2019 \nemissions level.  \n \nFor EU27 the 2020 emissions are estimated to be 3377 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents (Mt CO2 eq.), \nwhich indicates a decrease from 2019 of 365.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents (Mt CO2 eq.).  \n \nInternational aviation equalled for EU27 to 61 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2020, which shows a \ndecrease of 54.3 % in comparison to the 2019 levels. \n \n \n\n                                                           \n(2)  Where sub-sector emissions detail was not available it was gap-filled using simple allocation based on the \n\nprevious year\u2019s plits. In some instances sub-sectors emissions needed to be summed for sectors. These \nminor modifications were performed for Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg and \nSweden. \n\n(3)  Other non-EU Member States of the EEA are Liechtenstein and Turkey. As these countries did not submit \nany GHG data for 2020, they are not considered in this report. \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 11 \n\nFigure 2.1  Trends in total GHG emissions, 1990-2020 \n\n \nNote: Total GHG emissions without LULUCF including indirect CO2 and international aviation \nSource:  The EEA\u2019s ETC/CME, based on the 2021 Member States\u2019 GHG inventories submitted to UNFCCC for the years 1990\n2019 and proxy estimates for 2020. \n\n \n \nThe trend shows 9.8 % decrease in emissions for the EU27 (total with international aviation) since 2019 \nand the GDP growth is showing correspondingly negative trend of 6.1 % in the same year (Figure 2.2).

The exceptionally \nwarm years were 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The year 2020 was the warmest year for \nEurope (Copernicus, 2021). Furthermore, the warmest winter for 2019/2020 was noted. On the other \nhand, winter 2020/2021 was close to 1991-2020 average. The pattern in heating degree days (a \nstandardized measure for linking heating demand and weather conditions) confirms slightly lower \nheating demand in 2020 compared to 2019. The highest amount of cooling degree days in 2020 was \nobserved for Cyprus, Malta and Greece, as it is to be expected for these countries. Figure 2.2 also shows \nthat in the 11 Member States heating degree days increased while total emissions decreased. Therefore \nthe correlation between amount of heating degree days and total emissions is not very significant for \nmany Member states. \n\n2.1.2 Changes in EU GHG emissions by sector \n\nOn a sectoral basis, the largest absolute emission decrease in the EU occurred in the energy sector (i.e. \nall combustion activities and fugitive emissions). Energy related emissions decreased by 271 Mt CO2 eq. \n(-9.8 %) across the EU. Within the energy sector, emissions declined in energy industries (\u2212118 Mt CO2 \neq.), particularly in heat and electricity production, in manufacturing industries and construction (-26 Mt \nCO2 eq.), in residential and commercial (-18 Mt CO2 eq.), in transport (\u2212106 Mt CO2 eq.) and in fugitive \nemissions from fuels (-2 Mt CO2 eq.).  \n \nThese changes in emissions in 2020 reflect large changes in the fuel mix. Primary fossil energy \nconsumption decreased again in 2020, and the contribution of coal to the energy mix decreased in 2020 \nwhile the share of gas and renewable fuels increased. Wind and solar contributed the most to the \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 13 \n\nincrease in renewable electricity while solid biofuels decreased slightly and hydro stayed stagnant4. \nPrimary energy consumption of nuclear energy decreased as well as its contribution to the energy mix.  \n \nConsumption of coal, oil, gas and nuclear energy are primary energy consumption5 values from the ETC \nenergy efficiency proxy 2020. Renewable energy values are from the ETC RES proxy 2020. Hydro and \nwind are normalised.  \n \nThe consumption of all fossil fuels; solid, liquid and gaseous; decreased in 2020. The consumption of \ngaseous fuels decreased by 2.2 % while consumption of liquid fuels decreased significantly by 11.8 % and \nsolid fossil fuels consumption fell significantly as well by 19.1 %.  \n \nThe gaseous fuels consumption increased in thirteen Member States with highest increases in Lithuania \n(17.7 %), Malta (14.8 %) and Greece (9.8 %). In thirteen Member States gaseous fuels consumption fell \nwith the largest decrease in Denmark (-19.3 %) followed by Latvia (\u221217.1 %) and Spain (-9.7 %). \n \nLiquid fossil fuels consumption decreased in 26 Member States with the largest decreases being in Malta \n(-27.7 %), Luxembourg (-21.4 %) and Spain (-18.2 %).  \n \nAll the Member States showed decreasing solid fossil fuel consumption. The largest decreases were in \nPortugal (-54.7 %), Spain (-53.5 %) and Greece (-47.2 %). These changes in fossil fuel consumption are \nnot only related to heating degree day (HDD) effects as described in section 2.1.1. but also strongly \nconnected to the trends in electricity generation from fossil fuels and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n \nRenewable electricity generation continues to play an important role in GHG mitigation efforts by the EU \nand its Member States. Hydroelectric generation increased by 1.1 % across the EU with twelve Member \nStates experiencing higher hydro electricity production in 2020 than in 2019. Hydro production \ndecreased in fourteen Member States. The largest absolute decreases in gross hydro production were in \nRomania,  Belgium and Sweden. The largest absolute increases in gross hydro production were in Spain, \nItaly and Portugal. \n \nElectricity production from renewable sources increased significantly. Gross electricity generation from \nwind energy grew by 8.6 % in the EU across twenty Member States. The largest relative increases were in \nMalta (25.0 %), Belgium (24.8 %) and Luxembourg (23.7 %). The largest absolute contributions from wind \nenergy were in Germany, France and Spain.  \n \nIncreases in electricity production from photovoltaics were seen in most Member States (24) and \nproduction grew by 15.5 % across Europe, with very large relative increases in Ireland (198.7 %), Poland \n(180.1 %) and Finland (73.9 %). The largest absolute generation from photovoltaics was in Spain followed \nby Germany and Netherlands.  \n \nIn 2020 nuclear energy production across the EU decreased by 10.3 % compared to 2019. The largest \ndecreases in nuclear electricity generation occurred in Belgium (\u221220.9 %) followed by Sweden (-18.9 %) \nand Germany (-14.4 %). Nuclear electricity generation increased in five Member States. The highest \nincrease was in Slovenia (9.1 %), followed by the Netherlands (5.0 %) and Romania (1.3 %).  \n \nThe emissions from the sector Industrial Processes and Product Use decreased by 5.7 % between 2019 \nand 2020 in the EU27.

Table 2.1 summarises the emissions as CO2 eq. and percentage changes. It should \nbe noted, that in their proxy submissions, a number of Member States used the 2019 value for emissions \nfrom international aviation as an approximated value for 2020. Flight and emissions data from \nEurocontrol was used to gap-fill international aviation emissions where Member States did not include \nan estimate. For the EU 2020 proxy, this method was applied to seven countries. \n \n \n\nTable 2.1  Emissions including international aviation (kt CO2 eq.) \n\nEuropean Union (EU27) 1990 2019 2020 2020-2019 2020/2019 2020-1990 2020/1990 \n\nTotal excl.

Emissions from fuel combustion saw a decrease \nof 269 Mt CO2 eq. or 10.0 % compared to 2019. Table 2.4 shows that the largest change in fuel \ncombustion emissions occurred in 1.A.1 Energy Industries with a decrease of 118 Mt CO2 eq. (-13.1%). In \nthe sector 1.A.3 Transport, emissions also decreased (-106 Mt CO2 eq. or -12.7 %) as well as emissions in \n1.A.2 Manufacturing industries and construction (-26 Mt CO2 eq. or -6.0 %), 1.A.4 Other sectors (-18 Mt \nCO2 eq. or -3.4 %), 1.A.5 Other (-2 Mt CO2 eq. or \u221223.3 %) and 1.B Fugitive emissions from fuels (-2 Mt \nCO2 eq. or \u22123.5 %). \n \n \n\nTable 2.4  Energy sector emissions, change 2019-2020 \n\nChange 2019 / 2020, EU27 Mt CO2eq % \n\n1.A Fuel Combustion (Sectoral Approach) -268.9 -10.0% \n\n1.A.1 Energy Industries -117.6 -13.1% \n\n1.A.2 Manufacturing Industries and Construction -26.0 -6.0% \n\n1.A.3 Transport -105.9 -12.7% \n\n1.A.4 Other sectors -17.8 -3.4% \n\n1.A.5 Other -1.6 -23.3% \n\n1.B.

The largest emission decrease was in Germany \n(\u221265 Mt CO2 eq.) followed by Spain (\u221240 Mt CO2 eq.), France (\u221234 Mt CO2 eq.) and Italy (\u221234 Mt CO2 eq.).  \nGoing to more detail in the subcategory 1.A.1 Energy Industries, the largest reduction was in Germany \n(\u221237 Mt CO2 eq.), followed by Spain (\u221216 Mt CO2 eq.) and Poland (\u221211 Mt CO2 eq.). The increases were \nonly minor, with the largest change noted for Lithuania (+0.4 Mt CO2 eq.). Emissions changes in the \nsector 1.A.2 Manufacturing Industries and Construction were significantly smaller. The largest decrease \nwas in Germany (-6 Mt CO2 eq.). Emissions from 1.A.3 Transport significantly decreased, increases were \nidentified only in two Member States. The largest increase was in Estonia (+0.2 Mt CO2 eq.), while the \nlargest decrease is noted for France (\u221222 Mt CO2 eq.) in absolute values and in relative values the most \nsignificant decrease was noted for Luxembourg (-22 %). In 1.A.4 Other Sectors (which include residential \nand commercial sectors) emissions increased in nine Member States. The largest increase occurred in \nHungary (+0.6 Mt CO2 eq.). The largest decrease was in France (\u22124 Mt CO2 eq.). Emission changes in the \nsector 1.A.5 Other are significant only for France where emissions decreased by 2 Mt CO2 eq. In the \nother Member States are changes less than \u00b10.2 Mt CO2 eq. For the subcategory 1.B Fugitive Emissions \nfrom fuels, the changes for all Member States is less then \u00b11.0 Mt CO2 eq. \n\n2.2.2 Industrial Processes and Product Use \n\nThe Sector Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) contributes to about 9 % of total EU emissions \nand is the third most important source after energy and agriculture. Emissions from Industrial Processes \ndecreased by 19 Mt CO2 eq. in the EU (-5.7 %). Table 2.5 and Figure 2.8 show the subsector contribution \nto this trend in emissions.

The largest increase of IPPU emissions \nwas in Czechia (+0.4 Mt CO2 eq.) while the largest decreases were in France (\u22125 Mt CO2 eq.) followed by \nSpain (\u22123 Mt CO2 eq.) and Germany (\u22123 Mt CO2 eq.). In the subcategory 2.A Mineral Products, emissions \ndecreased by -2 Mt CO2 eq. for Spain, while the highest increase in Denmark is only +0.1 Mt CO2 eq. \nEmissions from 2.B Chemical Products decreased in the EU (-1 Mt CO2 eq. or \u22121.8 %). The largest \nincreases were in Italy (+0.7 Mt CO2 eq.) while the largest decrease was in France (\u22120.9 Mt CO2 eq.). \nEmissions from 2.C Metal Industry decreased by -10 Mt CO2 eq. or -13.1 % with the largest increase in \nCzechia (less than +0.1 Mt CO2 eq.) while the largest decrease occurred in France (\u22123 Mt CO2 eq.). The \nsubsector 2.D Non-energy Products from Fuels and Solvent Use has had only slight decrease in the \nemissions (-0.1 Mt CO2 eq. or -1.6 %). The changes in all Member States were less than \u00b10.1 Mt CO2 eq. \nThe subsector 2.E Electronic Industry showed slight absolute emission changes for the EU (+0.7 Mt CO2 \neq. or 87.3 %). This change is mainly driven by increase in Ireland (+0.8 Mt CO2 eq.). Emissions changes \nfor the other Member States were within \u00b10.1 Mt CO2 eq. The subsector 2.F Product uses as substitutes \nfor ODS saw emissions decrease by 2 Mt CO2 eq. (\u22122.2 %). In nine Member States emissions increased in \nthis source category, in 13 Member States emissions decreased and five Member States report no \nchanges. The largest decrease of emissions was in Spain, where 2.F emissions fell by 0.9 Mt CO2 eq., \nfollowed by Ireland (\u22120.8 Mt CO2 eq.). In contrast, emissions increased the most in Greece (+0.5 Mt CO2 \neq.). All other emission changes where less than \u00b10.5 Mt CO2 eq. Emissions from 2.G Other Product \nManufacture and Use decreased slightly for the EU (-1.1 Mt CO2 eq. or -10.9 %). The greatest emission \nchange is reported by Germany (\u22120.9 Mt CO2 eq.). Emission changes of the other Member States are less \nthan \u00b10.1 Mt CO2 eq. The decrease of emissions from 2.H Other is almost irrelevant by absolute terms \n(\u22120.1 Mt CO2 eq.) but significant in relative terms (\u221222.3 %). \n\n2.2.3 Agriculture \n\nAgriculture (excluding LULUCF) contributes to 11 % of European GHG emissions. Emissions from \nagriculture decreased by 1 Mt CO2 eq. or 0.4 % since 2019. The largest greenhouse gas emitting activities \nwithin the sector are CH4 from livestock and N2O from soils. Enteric fermentation and soils contributed \nabout 43 % and 39 % of the sector\u2019s emissions respectively. As shown in Table 2.6 and Figure 2.9 the \ndecrease in agriculture sector emissions is largely driven by decreased emissions from enteric \nfermentation, but agricultural soil, other carbon containing fertilizers, liming and manure management \ncontributed to this decrease as well.  \n\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5\n\nH.

The largest decrease \nwas in Germany (-0.6 Mt CO2 eq.). \n\n2.2.4 Waste \n\nThe Waste sector contributes to about 3 % of European emissions. Waste related emissions continue to \ndecrease reflecting the large relative proportion of emissions from solid waste disposal (71 % share on \nWaste emissions) and the ongoing effect of restrictions on landfilling of organic degradable waste that \nwas implemented decades ago.  \n \nEmissions from the Waste sector decreased by \u22121 Mt CO2 eq. compared to 2019.

For the remaining Member States constant \nemissions were estimated. \n\n2.3 ETS versus ESD emissions \n\nWithin the European Union there are two policy instruments for achieving the GHG emission reductions: \nOne part is covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) while the other is the Effort Sharing \nDecision (ESD). ESD emissions are calculated by deducting ETS emissions, CO2 emissions from domestic \naviation and NF3 emissions from total emissions including indirect CO2 emissions.

ETS data is from EUTL (verified emissions for 2019 and 2020, not from the \nMember States proxies). Value for domestic aviation (which is used for calculation of ESD emissions) was obtained \nfrom Eurocontrol. \n\n \n \nIn total, emissions changed by -8.1 % within the EU between 2019 and 2020. Emissions decreased in the \nETS sector and in the ESD sector but the decrease in the ESD sector (-5.6 %) is less significant than in the \nETS sector (-11.6 %). Figure 2.11 illustrates all emission trend changes. \n \nIn absolute terms, the total emission decrease in the EU was -293 Mt CO2 eq. Of this decrease 124 Mt CO2 eq. occurred in the ESD sector and -161 Mt CO2 eq. in the ETS sector. \n \nAt Member State level the trend change in emissions separated between ETS and ESD looks similar.

The largest absolute decrease was experienced in \nGermany (\u221243 Mt CO2 eq.) followed by Spain (\u221221 Mt CO2 eq.) and Italy (\u221215 Mt CO2 eq.). Estonia saw \nthe highest relative ETS emission decrease (\u221233.8 %). \n\nESD emissions increased in two Member States (Bulgaria and Czechia). The largest absolute as well as \nrelative increase can be observed in Czechia (+4 Mt CO2 eq. or +5.8 %). \n \n25 Member States saw decreases in ESD emissions. The largest absolute ESD emission declines were in \nFrance (\u221228 Mt CO2 eq.) followed by Germany (\u221227 Mt CO2 eq.), Spain (\u221223 Mt CO2 eq.) and Italy (\u221221 Mt \nCO2 eq.). The largest relative decrease of ESD emissions was in Luxembourg (\u221215 %). \n \nIncreases of both ETS and ESD emissions are not observed for any of the Member States. On the other \nhand, there are 23 Member States which had decreases in both ETS and ESD emissions. \n \nIn Bulgaria and Czechia emissions in the ETS sector decreased while emissions in the ESD sector \nincreased.

The IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 2006) recommends Parties to perform QA/QC procedures \nthat are important information to enable continuous improvement to inventory estimates. Through the \nquantification of deviations at the source level and for the inventory as a whole, improvements can be \nprioritized. Thus Parties may change methodologies in order to improve their greenhouse gas estimates \nat source level (e.g. moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3). Such methodological changes at Member States level \ncannot be captured in the calculation of the approximated GHG inventory for the EU. On-going quality \nimprovements in Member States\u2019 inventories to take effect in next year\u2019s official submissions to UNFCCC \nare therefore a source of uncertainty for the EU proxy inventory. \n \nThis section compares the differences between the previous proxy estimates and the subsequent official \ninventory submissions. \n \nLast year\u2019s proxy GHG estimates for 2019 overestimated the GHG emissions for the EU by 8.5 Mt CO2 eq. \nor 0.2 %.  \n \nThe effect of Member States\u2019 recalculations of GHG estimates and methodological improvements \ndominate the differences of the 2019 proxy emission estimates compared to 2019 emissions officially \nreported in 2021. After taking these recalculations into account difference between the proxy GHG \ninventory for 2019 and final GHG inventory submission was only 0.1 % for total emissions (including \nindirect CO2, excluding LULUCF) for the EU. \n\n3.1 Difference between MS proxy and final GHG inventories \n\n The proxy submissions by Member States closely mirrored the slight decrease in official emissions as \nreported to the UNFCCC this year. The differences per Member State given in Table 3.1 arise from \nseveral factors: different methodologies and data with varying precision used across the Member States \n(resp. ETC/CME for gap-filling); the lack of updated (t-1) activity data for some key emission sources; and, \nfrom Member States\u2019 own recalculations of GHG estimates and methodological improvements which \nmainly cannot be reflected in the approximated data where usually constant methodologies and \nemission factors are assumed. \n \nThe largest deviations in relative terms occurred for Czechia (proxy 5.7 % higher), followed by Croatia \n(proxy 3.2 % higher) and Malta (proxy 2.4 % lower). In absolute terms the deviations were highest for \nFrance (overestimate by proxy of 9.3 Mt CO2 eq.), Czechia (overestimate by proxy of 7.0 Mt CO2 eq.), \nGermany (underestimate by 5.2 Mt CO2 eq.) and the Netherlands (overestimate of proxy by 3.2 Mt CO2 \neq.). By comparing the percentage changes in emission levels 2018/2019 as derived from the 2020 proxy \nGHG inventory6 on the one hand and from the 2021 official GHG inventory submissions to UNFCCC on \nthe other, the deviations are in almost all cases in the same order of magnitude, see Figure 3.1. Also the \ndirection of the emission trend (increasing or decreasing) was estimated correctly except for Belgium, \nCyprus, Czechia, France, Lithuania and Malta. Cyprus, Lithuania and Malta had emission decreases \nestimated in its proxy while the emissions increased in the final inventory. For the other mentioned \ncountries the emissions decreased, even though the proxy was estimating emission increases. Hungary\u2019s \nboth the emission changes in the proxy and in the final inventory were quite small.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(6)  The 2018 value used in this calculation comes from 2020 submission. \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 32 \n\nAfter taking into account recalculations, the relative differences were largest for Malta (-9.0 %), Czechia \n(+6.5 %), Estonia (+3.4 %) and France (+2.1 %). \n\n \n \n\nTable 3.1  Difference per Member State for year 2019 between proxy and final GHG inventories \n\nMS Inventory 2019 \n(Submission \n\n2021) \n \n\n(kt CO2 eq.) \n\nProxy 2019 \n(Submission \n\n2020) \n \n\n(kt CO2 eq.) \n\nDeviation \n2019 \n\n \n \n\n(kt CO2 eq.) \n\nDeviation \n2019 \n\n \n \n\n(%) \n\nRecalculations \n\n \n \n\n(%) \n\nDeviation 2019 \ncleared of impact \nof recalculations \n\n \n(%) \n\nProxy \ncalculated \n\nby \n\nAT 79 842 80 361 519 0.7% -0.4% 0.2% MS \n\nBE 116 651 118 927 2 276 2.0% -0.5% 1.5% MS \n\nBG 55 955 56 367 412 0.7% -0.9% -0.2% ETC/CME \n\nCY 8 842 8 767 -74 -0.8% 0.0% -0.8% ETC/CME \n\nCZ 123 298 130 297 6 999 5.7% 0.9% 6.5% MS \n\nDE 809 799 804 619 -5 179 -0.6% -0.3% -0.9% MS \n\nDK 44 241 44 665 424 1.0% -0.2% 0.8% MS \n\nEE 14 699 15 021 322 2.2% 1.2% 3.4% MS \n\nES 314 529 313 485 -1 043 -0.3% -0.3% -0.6% MS \n\nFI 53 072 52 782 -291 -0.5% -0.1% -0.7% MS \n\nFR 435 999 445 274 9 275 2.1% -0.1% 2.1% MS \n\nGR 85 631 85 185 -446 -0.5% 0.1% -0.4% MS \n\nHR 23 605 24 365 759 3.2% -1.1% 2.1% MS \n\nHU 64 433 63 011 -1 422 -2.2% 2.4% 0.2% MS \n\nIE 59 778 58 745 -1 033 -1.7% 2.6% 0.9% MS \n\nIT 418 281 415 622 -2 658 -0.6% 0.2% -0.4% MS \n\nLT 20 368 20 219 -149 -0.7% -0.6% -1.3% MS \n\nLU 10 743 10 724 -19 -0.2% 0.2% 0.0% MS \n\nLV 11 145 11 537 393 3.5% -3.9% -0.4% MS \n\nMT 2 175 2 123 -52 -2.4% -6.6% -9.0% MS \n\nNL 180 740 183 938 3 198 1.8% -0.8% 1.0% MS \n\nPL 390 745 390 671 -74 0.0% -0.2% -0.3% MS \n\nPT 63 626 63 661 34 0.1% -0.2% -0.2% MS \n\nRO 111 767 112 168 401 0.4% -0.9% -0.5% MS \n\nSE 50 920 49 756 -1 164 -2.3% 0.8% -1.5% MS \n\nSI 17 065 17 074 9 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% MS \n\nSK 39 948 41 681 1 733 4.3% -2.7% 1.6% MS \n\nEU27 3 607 896 3 616 426 8 531 0.2% -0.1% 0.1% ETC/CME \n\nSource:  Member States submissions to UNFCCC and proxy estimates for 2019. \n\n \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 33 \n\nFigure 3.1  Relative difference between proxy and submitted inventories by Member State \n2018/2019 \n\n \n\nSource:  Member States submissions to UNFCCC and proxy estimates for 2019. \n\n \n \n\n3.2 Sectoral differences between proxy and final GHG inventories \n\nAt the sectoral level, the largest difference between the proxy and the final GHG inventory in absolute \nterms was in 1.A.4 Other sectors [Energy] (+10.5 Mt CO2 eq.) and 2.C Metal production [IPPU] (-8.0 Mt \nCO2 eq.).

Therefore largest relative deviations occur \nmainly in \u201cother\u201d categories which are compound items and usually comparatively low in absolute \nemission levels. \n \nChanges in the data reported as proxy in last year and as final in 2021 submissions under the UNFCCC are \nmostly affected by the sources of the activity data. The data available during preparation of the proxy \ninventory for the Energy sector are based on preliminary data and energy balances provided by the \nstatistical offices. For the inventory submitted in 2021 however, final energy balances were used. In case \nof the IPPU sector, data for the year X-1 is not usually available when preparing the approximated \ninventories, thus extrapolation and interpolation of the activity data are mostly used. In Agriculture and \nWaste there is usually the case that activity data are partly available (for instance population data), \nhowever statistical methods are also partly applied to estimate the proxy inventory.  \n \nIn the Energy sector, deviations after recalculation are very small. They are highest for 1.A.5 Other (2.3 %) and for 1.B Fugitive emissions (+2.1 %). In IPPU, there were considerable recalculations for some \nsubsectors. The largest relative deviations occurred in 2.H Other (-20.9 %). The largest absolute \ndifference was in subsector 2.C Metal production (-8.0 Mt CO2 eq. or -9.9 %) followed by 2.F Product \nuses as ODS substitutes (+3.4 Mt CO2 eq. resp. +3.6 %). After taking into account the recalculations \neffect, the deviation increases for the 2.H Other up to -24.7 % while for 2.C Metal production decreases \nsignificantly down to +0.4 % and for 2.F Product uses as ODS substitutes decreases down to +3.2 %. For \nthe IPPU sector overall after allowing for recalculations the deviation is 0.9 %. \n \nThe agricultural sector has a relative small deviation (+0.8 %) before allowing for recalculation and large \ndeviation (+9.9 %) after allowing for recalculations. The largest absolute deviations were in 3.A Enteric \nfermentation (+3.8 Mt CO2 eq. resp. +2.0 %). After considering recalculation effects the deviation for 3.A \nEnteric fermentation deviation increases up to +16.9 %. This fact may indicate that most of the \nrecalculations in Agriculture was already considered when approximated inventories were created. \n \nAfter taking the recalculations effect into consideration, the deviation for the waste sector still indicates, \nthat emissions in the waste sector were underestimated by 3.2 %. The largest absolute deviation was \nfound in subsector 5.A Solid waste disposal (-3.4 Mt CO2 eq. or -3.5 %). The emission of this category  \ndominate the total waste sector emissions and even after considering recalculations the deviation of 5.A \nemissions were still underestimated (-4.8 %). The deviations of all other waste subsectors are less than \n+/- 1.2 Mt CO2 eq. \n \nThe differences for estimates for indirect CO2 are quite significant (-3.2 % before and +1.2 % after \nconsidering recalculation effects). However the absolute amounts of indirect CO2 emissions have only a \nvery small share in total EU emissions. \n \nBy comparing the percentage changes in emission levels 2018/2019 as derived from the 2020 proxy GHG \ninventory on the one hand and from the 2021 official GHG inventory submissions to UNFCCC on the \nother by sectors, the differences are visible the most for Agriculture, see Figure 3.2. \n \n  \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 35 \n\nTable 3.2  Difference per sector for year 2019 between proxy and final GHG inventories. \n\nSector Inventory 2019 \n(Submission \n\n2021) \n \n\n(kt CO2 eq.) \n\nProxy 2019 \n(Submission \n\n2020) \n \n\n(kt CO2 eq.) \n\nDeviation \n2019 \n\n \n \n\n(kt CO2 eq.) \n\nDeviation \n2019 \n\n \n \n\n(%) \n\nRecalculations \n\n \n \n\n(%) \n\nDeviation 2019 \ncleared of impact \nof recalculations \n\n \n(%) \n\nTotal incl. indirect CO2 excl. \nLULUCF \n\n4 059 228 4 068 155 8 927 0.2% 0.9% 1.1% \n\n1 Energy 3 129 471 3 135 180 5 710 0.2% 0.0% 0.1% \n\n1.A Fuel combustion 3 053 353 3 056 740 3 387 0.1% 0.0% 0.1% \n\n1.A.1 Energy \nindustries \n\n986 870 987 373 503 0.1% 0.4% 0.5% \n\n1.A.2 Manufacturing \nindustries \n\n485 927 484 527 -1 400 -0.3% -0.2% -0.4% \n\n1.A.3 Transport 955 730 951 792 -3 938 -0.4% 0.0% -0.4% \n\n1.A.4 Other sectors 616 419 626 900 10 480 1.7% -1.0% 0.7% \n\n1.A.5 Other 8 406 6 148 -2 258 -26.9% 24.5% -2.3% \n\n1.B Fugitive emissions 76 117 78 440 2 323 3.1% -1.0% 2.1% \n\n2 Industrial processes & \nproduct use \n\n369 791 367 329 -2 462 -0.7% 1.6% 0.9% \n\n2.A Mineral products 110 986 111 249 263 0.2% 0.2% 0.4% \n\n2.B Chemical industry 62 126 63 752 1 626 2.6% -1.9% 0.7% \n\n2.C Metal production 80 881 72 867 -8 014 -9.9% 10.3% 0.4% \n\n2.D Non-energy products 9 038 9 582 544 6.0% -4.3% 1.7% \n\n2.E Electronic Industry 838 833 -5 -0.6% 0.3% -0.3% \n\n2.F Product uses as ODS \nsubstitutes \n\n93 934 97 288 3 354 3.6% -0.3% 3.2% \n\n2.G Other product \nmanufacture and use \n\n11 608 11 457 -151 -1.3% -0.9% -2.2% \n\n2.H Other 381 301 -80 -20.9% -3.8% -24.7% \n\n3 Agriculture 428 221 431 573 3 352 0.8% 9.2% 9.9% \n\n3.A Enteric fermentation 185 601 189 354 3 754 2.0% 14.8% 16.9% \n\n3.B Manure management 62 505 63 056 551 0.9% 16.2% 17.1% \n\n3.C Rice cultivation 2 489 2 540 50 2.0% -1.7% 0.3% \n\n3.D Agricultural soils 164 404 164 101 -303 -0.2% 1.6% 1.5% \n\n3.F Field burning of \nagricultural residues \n\n0 0 0 NA NA NA \n\n3.G Liming 659 679 20 3.1% -3.8% -0.7% \n\n3.H Urea application 6 159 5 831 -327 -5.3% 0.4% -4.9% \n\n3.I Other carboncontaining fertilizers \n\n4 156 4 116 -40 -1.0% 4.5% 3.6% \n\n3.J Other 676 288 -387 -57.3% 180.4% 123.1% \n\n5 Waste 1 573 1 607 34 2.2% -1.9% 0.2% \n\n5.A Solid waste disposal 134 834 132 491 -2 343 -1.7% -1.5% -3.2% \n\n5.B Biological treatment \nof solid waste \n\n96 871 93 482 -3 389 -3.5% -1.3% -4.8% \n\n5.C Incineration & open \nburning of waste \n\n8 380 8 361 -20 -0.2% 0.5% 0.2% \n\n5.D Waste water \ntreatment & discharge \n\n3 927 3 844 -83 -2.1% 3.2% 1.1% \n\n5.E Other 25 593 26 712 1 118 4.4% -3.2% 1.2% \n\nIndirect CO2 1 634 1 582 -52 -3.2% 4.3% 1.2% \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 36 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2  Relative difference between proxy and submitted inventories by sector 2018/2019 \n\n  \n\nSource:  Member States submissions to UNFCCC and proxy estimates for 2019. \nNote: Only sectors with GHG emissions of more than 100 Mt CO2 eq. in 2019 are shown. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 37 \n\n4 Methodologies and data sources at Member State level \n\n4.1 Description of different approaches \n\nThis report presents the estimated GHG emissions for 2020 based on Member State emissions estimates, \nsubmitted to EEA by 31 July. The aggregated EU proxy GHG emission estimates are based on these \nsubmissions and gap filling where necessary. \n \nUnder the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 which replaces Regulation (EU) 525/2013 on the mechanism for \nmonitoring and reporting GHG emissions (EU MMR) and its implementing provisions, Member States \nsubmit, where possible, to the European Commission approximated GHG inventories by 31 July every \nyear for the preceding year t\u20131. Where a Member State has not submitted a 'proxy' inventory, the EEA \nuses its own estimates for gap-filling purposes in order to have a complete approximated GHG inventory \nat EU level. \n \nIn previous years the EEA and its ETC/CME developed and used the latest activity data available at \ncountry level to estimate the emissions. For emission sources for which no appropriate data sets exist, \nemissions were extrapolated from past trends, or emissions from the previous year are kept constant \nwhere historic data do not show a clear linear trend. That methodology which estimated emissions using \na 'bottom-up' approach was complex and time-consuming. This year, submission of approximated \ngreenhouse gas inventory was only missing from Bulgaria, which have a share less than 2 % of the \nemissions of the whole EU. Previous year gap-filling for Bulgaria, which was done by a more simplified \napproach, had 0.7% deviation between the 2019 proxy and final GHG inventory of Bulgaria. Deviation \ncleared of recalculations impact was only -0.2%, the 2nd closest of all the EU MS submissions. Therefore \nBulgaria was gap-filled this year by ETC/CME for EEA again with a more simplified approach. \n \nIn some cases it has been necessary to allocate or distribute the reported emissions to sectors or within \nsub-sectors. This is done to allow for the aggregation and explanation of trends at EU level. Details are \ngiven in section 4.4.  \n\n4.2 MS proxies submitted  \n\nMember States are responsible for the methodological choice regarding their own estimates. The MS \nshould submit approximated GHG inventories for the preceding year (t\u20131) in accordance with the \nSummary2 table of the Common Reporting Format (CRF). The implementing regulation of the EU MMR \nrequires the calculation at a level of disaggregation of source categories reflecting the activity data and \nmethods available for the preparation of the proxy estimates. Therefore, it is in line with the MMR if \nMember States submit only partially complete aggregated Summary2 tables with their proxy estimates. \nAdditionally Member States should split emissions \u2013 where available \u2013 into ETS and non-ETS emissions \nand shall provide information on drivers and trends for t\u20131. \n\n4.3 Gap-filling for MS not submitting a proxy inventory \n\nThis year, estimates by the EEA and ETC/CME are made only for the major source categories; the energy \nand IPPU sectors. Relevant data sources with updated activity or emissions data for the year t-1 were \nidentified and used to calculate emissions. For source categories for which no international data sets \nwith updated activity data exist or which are too complex for a simple approach, emissions from the \nprevious year were kept constant. On this basis, a simple approach was developed covering the full \nscope of emissions included in a GHG inventory submission. \n \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 38 \n\nThe EEA estimates are based on publicly available data sets at the European level. For the estimation of \napproximated emissions, the following data sources for emissions or activities were used: \n\n\u2022 Verified emissions reported under the EU-ETS and recorded in the EUTL7; \n\n\u2022 The percentage change in the ENEF proxy PEC value between 2020 and 2019. (EEA, 2021c) \n \nThe driver percentage from the ENEF proxy PEC is based on Eurostat monthly data. The ENEF proxy is \nprepared for the EEA by ETC/CME (EEA, 2021c). \n \nBased on these data sources, emission estimates for year 2020 were made for the following source \ncategories: \n\n\u2022 1. Energy \n\no 1.A Fuel Combustion \n\no 1.A.1 Energy Industries \n\no 1.A.2 Manufacturing Industries and Construction \n\no 1.A.3 Transport \n\no 1.A.4 Other sectors \n\no 1.A.5 Other \n\no 1.B Fugitive emissions from fuels \n\no 1.  Solid fuels \n\no 2.  Oil and natural gas \n\n\u2022 2. Industrial Processes and Product Use \n\no 2.A Mineral Industry \n\no 2.C Metal Production \n \nAdditionally, flight and emissions data from Eurocontrol was used to gap-fill international aviation \nemissions for those Member States that did not provide an estimate. \n \nAll other source categories were filled by using previous year emissions. \n \nThe timing of these calculations depends on the release of the underlying data sources. The availability of \ndata sources (including the MS GHG inventories) is shown in Table 4.1.  \n \n\n \n\nTable 4.1  Time of availability of data used for the proxy inventory \n\nData source Availability \n\nEUTL verified emissions Data as of 25 August 2020 was used \n\nEurostat monthly data  mid July \n\nGHG inventory data from CRF files (via UNFCCC) early June  \n\nEurocontrol flight and emissions data Early September \n\nSource:  ETC/CME \n \n \n\n                                                           \n(7) European Union Emissions Trading System data viewer, 11 August 2021  \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1 \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/emissions-trading-viewer-1\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 39 \n\nNational GHG inventories are required to fulfil certain principles as laid out in the UNFCCC reporting \nguidelines for GHG inventories: inventories must be transparent, consistent, comparable, complete and \naccurate (TCCCA). The IPCC Good Practice Guidance recommends Parties to perform QA/QC procedures \nthat are important information to enable continuous improvement to inventory estimates. Through the \nquantification of uncertainty at the source level and for the inventory as a whole, improvements can be \nprioritised. Thus Parties may change methodologies in order to improve their greenhouse gas estimates \nat source level (e.g. moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3). Such methodological changes at Member States level \ncannot be captured in the calculation of the approximated GHG inventory for the EU. On-going quality \nimprovements in Member States\u2019 inventories to take effect in next year\u2019s official submissions to UNFCCC \nare therefore a source of uncertainty for the proxy inventory. \n \nIt has to be taken into account that any recent national improvements of GHG reporting methodologies \ncould not be considered for approximated GHG inventories calculated centrally by EEA and its ETC/CME, \nas the 2021 estimates for the 2020 proxy inventory were based on the national methodologies used for \n2021 inventory submissions (covering emissions until 2019). Thus, revised methodologies and \nparameters at Member States level can result in differences between the final inventory and the proxy \ninventory. \n\n4.3.1 CO2 emissions from 1.

Also for all emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases (HFCs, \nPFCs, SF6, NF3) previous year values were used as proxy estimates. \n\n4.4 Methodology for gap-filling of partially complete proxy submissions \n\nThe approximated GHG emissions data are submitted by Member States in a form consistent with CRF \nSummary2 tables. However, these tables are not always submitted with complete sub-sector level \ndisaggregation. Because EU emissions are the sum of the Member States\u2019 emissions, in order to achieve \na complete EU proxy inventory, some gap filling has been required. For some MS proxies the reported \nemissions have been allocated or distributed within sub-sectors. This is done to allow for the aggregation \nand explanation of trends at EU level. Allocations were needed for Germany and Sweden. In some cases \nthe amendments involved simply including subtotals or totals - for Portugal this amendment was \nnecessary.  \n\n4.4.1 Total CO2 eq., including indirect CO2, without LULUCF in ETS and non-ETS \n\nMost Member States did report Total CO2 equivalent emissions, without LULUCF. There has however \nbeen some ambiguity about how to report included indirect CO2 emissions. In previous years, a total was \nincluded in cell J68 whether or not the total included indirect CO2 emissions. Many MS leave this cell \nblank even if they do report indirect CO2 emissions. For consistency this calculation has been adjusted \n(J68 =SUM J66,B65), in all proxy sheets so that there is a total shown in cell J68 whether or not the MS \nhas calculated any indirect CO2 emissions. \n \nMost Member States provided a split of ETS and non-ETS emissions in their submissions. \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 41 \n\n4.4.2 F-gases \n\nEmissions from fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases8) can appear in the following source categories of \nindustrial processes and product use: \n\n\u2022 2.B Chemical industry \n\n\u2022 2.C Metal industry \n\n\u2022 2.E Electronic industry \n\n\u2022 2.F Product uses as ODS substitutes \n\n\u2022 2.G Other product manufacture and use \n\n\u2022 2.H Other \n \n\nGermany and Sweden reported F-gas emissions but did not disaggregate into source categories. \nReported F-gas emissions were allocated using the shares of F-gas emissions per source categories of the \nlatest available GHG inventories. \n \nThe gap-filling approach used for Bulgaria (described in section 4.3), calculates proxy estimates for whole \nof the IPPU sector. For Bulgaria, the F-gas emissions were distributed in the same way as for Germany \nand Sweden using allocations derived from reports for the previous year. \n\n4.4.3 Gap-filling LULUCF \n\nData from Member States\u2019 2021 projections was applied to gap-fill LULUCF. Gap-filling was done for six \nMember States; Denmark, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia and Slovenia. \n \nCyprus reported LULUCF but did not disaggregate emissions and removals into source categories. \nReported LULUCF emissions and removals were allocated using the shares of LULUCF emissions and \nremovals per source categories of the latest available GHG inventory. \n\n4.4.4 Gap-filling aviation data \n\nGap-filling of aviation data was done by applying Eurocontrol data. International aviation was gap-filled \nfor Denmark, Luxembourg, Portugal and Slovenia. Domestic aviation was gap-filled for all Member States \nexcept Estonia, Finland and Luxembourg. Eurocontrol aviation data is divided into three parts; \ninternational aviation, domestic aviation and to other aviation, when Eurocontrol has been uncertain \nwhere to allocate the data. Proxy domestic aviation contains the other aviation data. Domestic aviation \ndata has an effect on total ESD value.  \n\n4.4.5 Sweden \n\nIn the submission, not all sectors were fully disaggregated into corresponding categories.

If this information is \n\npublicly available please include the hyperlink to the relevant website.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Covid-19 epidemic has had an impact on road transport with a decrease in fuel sales of 14.3% (in CO2 equivalent) at the national level. The \n\ntotal emissions (without LULUCF) would decrease with about 7.4%. The difference between the total reported ETS-emission data and the ETS-emissions \n\nreported in the greenhouse gas inventory is due to a different approach in methodologies and consequently  the subtraction in the inventory of a part of the \n\n\u2018avoided\u2019 emissions of CO2 that are recuperated during the production of ammonia.\n\nIn Wallonia, first estimates of the emissions for the year 2020 indicate a decrease of the total GHG emissions. This decrease is evenly due to the ETS sector \n\n(energy, mineral and chemical industry sectors) and a milder winter (residential and tertiary sectors), 2020 being the warmest year currently measured in \n\nBelgium. The impact of COVID-19 remains limited on ETS emissions. However other impacts such as home working is not considered due to lack of data. In the \n\ncase of the Brussels-Capital region, first estimates of the emissions for the year 2020 indicate a decrease of the total GHG emissions. This proxy is based on an \n\nestimate of the real energy consumption in the building sector. This evolution could be explained by a combination of factors such as warmer temperatures \n\nin 2020 than 2019, the COVID pandemic situation and consumer behaviour amongst others. In The Flemish region, first estimates of the emissions for the year \n\n2020 indicate a significant decrease of the total GHG emissions. This decrease is mainly due to 1) the ETS sector (mainly energy and iron and steel sectors) a.o. \n\ncaused by the COVID19-pandemic (lower oil demand and lower production) and a maintenance in one of the blast furnaces in this region and 2) a milder \n\nwinter (residential and comercial sectors), 2020 being the warmest year currently measured in Belgium. However other impacts such as home working and \n\nthe impact in the commercial sector is not yet considered due to lack of detailed data at this moment.\n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 48 \n\nBulgaria (EEA calculation) \n\n  \n\nYear Proxy 2020\n\n(Sheet 1 of 1) Submission EEA 2021\n\nCountry BULGARIA\n\nGeographical scope\n(4)\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS SOURCE AND CO2\n(1) CH4 N2O HFCs PFCs SF6\n\nUnspecified \n\nmix of HFCs \n\nand PFCs\n\nNF3 Total ETS non-ETS\n\nSINK CATEGORIES\n\nTotal (net emissions)\n(1)\n\n28109.99 6259.25 6011.39 1817.89 0.02 17.51 NO,NA NO,NA 42216.06\n\n1.

According to the year-on-year indices at CzSO (industrial production), information about changes in each month were taken. Based on this we \n\nmade average from these values. And we decreased values arrised from the linear regression about this indices. This was done for sector 1A1, 1A2 and for \n\nfugitive emissions 1B1 (solid fuels). For the 1A4, 1A5 and 1B2 we did not have indices from the CzSO, therefore we decided to use data only from the linear \n\nregression as in previous years.    \n\nTransport\n\nRoad transport is calculated by the COPERT 5 program, which is based on the EMEP/EEA Emission inventory Guidebook 2019 and the IPCC 2006 Guidelines - \n\nCO2 is calculated by Tier 2 and other pollutants by Tier 3. Other modes of transport are calculated by the CDV model, which is based on national specific EF \n\nand factors from the IPCC Guidelines, mostly at the Tier 1 level.\n\n2 IPPU\n\nMineral industry estimation is based on ETS data value for year 2020 and correlation of previous years values between ETS and NIR data. The ETS data results \n\nfor 2020 was used to calculate production changes in sector 2C. Category 2E+2G were estimated according to the trend in last decade. Prediction model \n\nproduces predicted values for 2F, obtained by evaluating the regression function in the selected time frame (in most cases time series 2011-2019). Standard \n\nerrors of the predictions are also calculated. For more accurate estimations outliers from the activity data were removed, also overall trend across whole time \n\nseries was checked. In some cases, input for prediction model was based on expert judgement, mainly in cases where trend change was observed and it is \n\nexpected that new trend remains (Category 2H3 contains HFO-1234yf emission estimates related to category 2.F.1.e). Category 2H1 was interpolated by using \n\ndata from last year and ETS 2020 value for this category.\n\n3 Agriculture\n\nThe estimated emissions in the sector slightly decreased of about 4 % in comparison with previous submission.  This is a consequence of the continuous \n\nupdating of methodological procedures and the gradual transition to national specific data. The AWMS system is updated for Submission 2021, and methane \n\nemissions from manure management are estimated using national data. Thanks to OAQC processes, technical errors in the calculation file were detected and \n\ncorrected.\n\n4 LULUCF\n\nEstimates for 4A Forest land were revised using CBM-CFS3 model which was used for dead organic matter (DOM) and soil carbon pools. These pools were \n\npreviously included either incompletely (DOM including littter and deadwood) or not reported (soil). Entire time period since 1990 was recalculated. These \n\nchanges affected estimates for both 4A1  (land remaining) and 4A2 (land comversions) categories. Estimates for Cropland (4B), Grassland (4C), Wetlands (4D) \n\nand Settlements (4E) were also recalculated due to some ammendments and rectifications affecting soil carbon pool estimates.\n\n5 Waste\n\nAlmost all values were made as linear extrapolation of the waste treated or/and gas produced and follow-up emissions calculated. Data on inhabitants, \n\nsewer connection etc. in 5.D have been available. In 5.A and 5.C there is expected an increase in clinical and municipal solid waste because of the covid-19 \n\npandemic. Due to the increased waste production but no detailed data on treatment available yet, this approximation is probably uncertain but the \n\nemissions probably grow. There are also planned recalculations: 5.D emission factors (already used in revised estimate), and 5.A waste composition. The \n\nemissions in 5.D will be lower, the effect of changed waste composition on emissions in 5.A is not so clear. All emissions except in 5.D are considered to be \n\nhigher than in 2019.\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

ETS emission \n\nhave decreased by 33.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. According to the Proxy estimates non-ETS emissions have decreased by 3.9% compared to 2018. The \n\ndrivers underpinning the total GHG emission decrease are elaborated below.\n\nEnergy: Total GHG emissions in Energy sector have decreased 23.1% compared to year 2019 due to a decrease in emissions from Energy industries in the \n\npublic electricity and heat production, because of the increase of the EU ETS emission allowance price in 2020. The CO2 allowance price increase affected the \n\nelectricity production of oil shale combustion plants and their output.\n\nEmissions increased in the Transportation sector by almost 6.5% due to increase in diesel fuel demand in road transportation, which is a result of lowered \n\nfuel tax on diesel fuel. Although alternative fuel consumption has increased, the lowered fuel tax on diesel fuel had a bigger impact on increasing the \n\nemissions in the transportation sector. In the ETS and non-ETS section in the table above CO2 emissions from domestic aviation have been presented under \n\nthe column ETS (category 1.A.3).  \n\nEmissions decreased in the Manufacturing industries and construction sector by 38.9% compared to year 2019, mainly from the cement production due to the \n\nincrease of the EU ETS emission allowance price in 2020.\n\nThe Energy sector\u00b4s proxy estimation are based on Statistics Estonia\u00b4s short term fuel consumption statistics (mini Joint Questionnaires), which are \n\npreliminary estimations for 2020. However, the national inventory report is based on annual Joint Questionnaires, which is compiled in autumn and is more \n\ndetailed and therefore changes in the final emission estimations are foreseen.\n\nIPPU:  Total emissions from IPPU sector decreased by 47.7% in comparison to 2019. The reason for this large decrease is that clinker production was \n\ndiscontinued in March 2020. Emissions from other categories than Mineral industry had little effect on the total decrease in 2020 in comparison to 2019.\n\nThe emissions of F-gases decreased a few tonnes in comparison to 2019. This decrease has many reasons: decrease in HFC use in foam production, in \n\naerosols, decrease of vehicles having HFC-134a in their air conditioner (due to ban on HFC-134a according to the Directive 2006/40/EC) and replacing some \n\ncommercial and industrial refrigeration equipment with zero or lower GWP refrigerants.\n\nIndirect CO2 emissions  from NMVOC from solvent use and road paving with asphalt (ca 20.86 kt CO2) are included into 2.D subsector.\n\nAgriculture: Total emissions from Agriculture sector in 2020 increased by 1.33% compared to 2019. The main increase of emissions in 2019 compared to the \n\nprevious year occurred in 3.B Manure Management subcategory (increased by 4,01%). This is mainly caused by the increase of the number of swine, \n\nespecially the increase in the number of fattening pigs. Emissions from 3.A Enteric Fermentation increased very slightly, 0,9%, this is also mostly due to the \n\nincrease in number of pigs, especially in the number of fattening pigs. Emissions from 3.D Agricultural Soils, 3.G Liming and 3.H Urea application remain at the \n\nsame level compared to the 2019 emissions.\n\nWaste: Total emissions from waste sector in 2020 decreased by 1.4% compared to 2019. Activity data for calculating 2020 waste sector emissions under \n\ncategories 5.A, 5.B and 5.C is under inspection by the Estonian Environment Agency and is not yet available. Due to this, activity data from 2021 submission is \n\nused for calculating emissions in 5A and additional corrections for 2019 emissions are made in 5.B (deleting double counting of one company) and 5.C \n\n(updating calorific values for CH4 calculations in 5.C.1). For calculating emissions under 5.D, plant specific data was used for industrial wastewater emission \n\ncalculation. Because the % of centralized wastewater system coverage will be updated by autumn, therefore data from 2021 submission was used for \n\ndomestic wastewater emission calculation. Because waste activity data is not yet available than Long-term storage of C in waste disposal sites has not been \n\nestimated.\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

Compared with the previous year, emissions decreased by nine per cent. The fall in emissions was affected by the \n\nwarm winter, recent changes in the structure of electricity production and a decrease in transport performance. The effect of the covid-19 pandemic on \n\nemission reductions is not available from the inventory data, because the amount of emissions was affected not only by exceptional circumstances but also \n\nby weather and cyclical fluctuations in industry, but the exceptional conditions were visible as a decrease in transport emissions. Emissions not included in \n\nthe EU Emissions Trading System fell by three per cent but exceeded the annual emission allocations set by the EU by 0.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. \n\nEspecially the decrease in fellings from the previous year increased the net sink of the LULUCF sector, i.e. land use, land-use change and forestry, which \n\naccording to the instant preliminary data was -23.0 million tonnes of CO2 eq. Emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector are not included in the total \n\nemissions described above. \n\nFor more information, see https://www.stat.fi/til/khki/2020/khki_2020_2021-05-21_tie_001_en.html\n\nNote 1: The preliminary estimate for transport includes a preliminary estimate also for domestic aviation: 86.39 kt CO2. Please use this estimate when \n\npublishing data on emissions trends for EU MS to provide a more accurate estimate for the non-ETS sector emissions.\n\nNote 2: In the template the total non-ETS emissions with indirect CO2 cannot be filled in. As the official non-ETS emissions include the indirect emissions, \n\nthis should be corrected in the template. Our total non-ETS emissions with indirect CO2 are 28 625.42 kt CO2 eq.\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

If this information is \n\npublicly available please include the hyperlink to the relevant website.\n\n1. Energy. Although GHG emissions increased in energy industries subsector, they were compensated by decreases in all other energy subsectors in 2020. This \n\nhappened mainly because Elektrenai thermal power plant was producing electricity under standard conditions after a few years break. A decrease of GHG \n\nemissions in manufacturing industries was influenced by decreased coal consumption in cement production, the decrease in transport was observed due to \n\nthe decreased diesel oil consumption in road transport where higher share of biodiesel in diesel oil played a big role together with decreased mobility due to \n\nCOVID-19 pandemic. A reduction of coal consumption is observed in commercial/institutional and residential sectors, and the GHG reduction in fugitive \n\nemissions is influenced by decreased hydrogen production in petroleum refinery and decreased natural gas leakages in natural gas transmission system. \n\n2. IPPU. Emissions from IPPU sector in 2020 have decreased by 9,5% compared to 2019 due to decrease of production in mineral and chemical industry and due \n\nto decrease of F-gases consumption ir Commercial and Industrial Refrigeration. \n\n3. Agriculture. Emissions from agriculture sector in 2020 have increased by 1% compared to 2019. Emissions from enteric fermentation and manure \n\nmanagement has decreased due to decrease in livestock population which are responsible for the biggest share of agriculture emissions from these \n\ncategories. Increase of agriculture soils emissions is related mainly to the increase of inorganic N fertilizer consumption and increase of crop harvest and area \n\nharvested. Despite that emission from livestock in 2020 has decreased, overall emissions from agriculture has increased due to agriculture soils. \n\n4. LULUCF. Decrease of GHG removals in LULUCF sector are mainly determined by decreasing GHG removals in forest land. Reduced GHG removals in forest \n\nland results from lower growing stock volume change compared to the previous year, which might be affected by natural/climatic factors. \n\n5. Waste. Emissions from waste sector in 2020 have decreased by 2% compared to 2019. The decrease is mainly due to the reduction of disposed of waste in \n\nlandfills and the increase in the number of people connected  to centralized sewerage networks.\n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 68 \n\nLuxembourg (submitted by member state) \n\n \n\nYear 2020\n\n(Sheet 1 of 1) Submission 2021\n\nCountry Luxembourg\n\nGeographical scope\n(4)\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS SOURCE AND CO2\n(1) CH4 N2O HFCs PFCs SF6\n\nUnspecified \n\nmix of HFCs \n\nand PFCs\n\nNF3 Total ETS non-ETS\n\nSINK CATEGORIES\n\nTotal (net emissions)\n(1)\n\n8 263,12 583,90 321,45 61,24 NA 10,79 NA NA 9 240,50 1 376,50 7 864,00\n\n1.

For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and \n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 71 \n\n  \n\nGeneral.  Latvia`s approximate GHG emissions for 2020 were estimated using available activity data from Central Statististical Bureau of Latvia, annual GHG \n\nreports under EU ETS and data from national databases or extrapolation in cases activity data were not available yet. In sectors where stable trend was not \n\nobserved the emissions were left in 2019 level. Compared to previous inventory (GHG inventory submission to UNFCCC on 13th of April 2021) Latvia`s total \n\nGHG emissions excluding LULUCF, including indirect CO2 have decreased by 6.1% in 2020. Under 2A1 (Cement production) two different CO2 emission \n\ncalculation approaches are used. Under EU ETS clinker producer uses Monitoring reporting Regulation (COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 601/2012 of 21 June \n\n2012 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council) to \n\ncalculate CO2 emissions from clinker and cement kiln dust using default EFs, but for GHG inventory CO2 emissions are calculated according to 2006 IPCC \n\nGuidelines and EFs are calculated using plant specific data. This results in 3.1% (18 kt CO2 eq) difference between ETS CO2 emissions from clinker production \n\nreported under Article 21 of the ETS directive (column L) and GHG inventory (column J) calculated in 2020. Very minor differences occur also for glass \n\nproduction due to the same reason and rounding.\n\nEnergy. Total GHG emissions in Energy sector (excluding Transport) have decreased by 11.0% in 2020 in comparison with 2019. In 2020 emissions in sector 1A1 \n\nEnergy Industries have decreased by 25.1% compared to 2019 due to decrease use of natural gas in sector (-25.1%) as well as decrease in other fuel use in \n\nsector. In sector 1A2 Manufacturing Industries and Construction emissions have decreased by 3.2% in comparison with 2019. In 2020 use of all fuels have \n\ndecreased with exception of biomass and other fossil fuels where slight increase can be seen. In 2020 emissions in sector 1A4 Other Sectors have increased \n\nby 2.1% compared to 2019.In 2020 use of liquid fuels and other fossil fuels have increased, but use of other fuels have decreased. \n\nTransport. Total transport emissions in 2020 have fallen by 6% compared to 2019. The largest reduction is found on the railway, where emissions are 41% \n\nlower in 2020 than in 2019. Emissions in road transport have fallen by about 5.1%. The steepest decline in emissions in 2020 has been recorded in \n\ninternational aviation. In that sector, emissions fell by about 63% against 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on mobility opportunities and \n\nwas therefore a key factor in the reduction of emissions in international aviation and road transport. Other factors also affected the railways. \n\nIPPU.  Emissions from IPPU sector in 2020 are decreased by 0.9% compared to 2019 due to a small decrease of emissions in all subsectors. The only lime \n\nproduction company stopped lime production from dolomite since 2016 thus CO2 emissions from 2.A.2 are NO. The same for the only iron and steel plant \n\nwhich didn`t  produce steel anymore but only rolls armature not causing CO2 emissions thus CO2 and CH4 emissions from 2.C.1 are NO.                                                                                                                                  \n\nF-gases Activity data from annual F-gases reports for proxy emission calculation were not available yet, therefore emissions were calculated by either using \n\nprevious three years average F-gases amounts filled into new manufactured products or keeping previous year`s emission amount. Total F-gases emissions \n\n(2.F + 2.G) have decreased by 1.0% compared to 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nSolvents Activity data for the Solvent Use sector was not available in 2020. There is a stability in trends of CO2 emissions from Solvent use sector in later 3 \n\nyears either, therefore emissions in 2020 were assumed were extrapolated taking into account emission rates from these previous years (average). There are \n\nslight increase in emissions compared with the previous year (+5.4%).\n\nFor N2O from product use activity data wasn't available in 2020. There is a stability in trends of N2O emissions from N2O from product use sector in later 3 \n\nyears therefore emissions were extrapolated taking into account emission rates from previous these years (average). There are negligible changes in \n\nemissions compared with the previous year (+2.89%).\n\nAgriculture. In 2020 GHG emissions are 2240.22 kt CO2 eq., that was 1.7% more than a year before. Emissions from enteric fermentation increase by 0.1%, \n\nemissions from manure management decrease by 0.4% and emissions from agricultural soils increase by 1.8%, also emissions from liming increase by 39%. \n\nCompared to 2019, the total utilised agricultural area in the country grew by 9.6 thousand ha or 0.5 %, reaching 1 969.0 thousand ha in 2020. In 2020, compared \n\nto the year before, arable land increased by 14.9 thousand ha or 1.1 % Areas of meadows and pastures continued to reduce \u2013 in 2020, compared to 2019, by 5.6 \n\nthousand ha or 0.9 %. In 2020, the highest harvested production of grain in the history of Latvia was obtained - 3.5 million tonnes, which is 333.9 thousand \n\ntonnes or 10.6 % more than in the previous year. In 2020, 753.7 thousand hectares were sown with cereals, which is 11.4 thousand hectares or 1.5 % more than \n\nin the previous year, and it is the largest area of cereals in Latvian agriculture. Consumption of nutrients per hectare of sown area increased \u2013 of nitrogen \n\nfrom 64 kg in 2019 to 66 kg in 2020 or by 3.1 %. The increase in the volume of mineral fertilizers used per hectare was facilitated mainly by the growth of the \n\nvolume of mineral fertilizers used per hectare of cereals and industrial crops respectively by 5.0 % and 5.6 %. Mineral fertilizers were applied on 64 % of the \n\ntotal sown area (60 % in 2019). At the end of 2020, the number of cattle increased by 3,7 thousand or 0.9 %, while the number of dairy cows decreased by 2,4 \n\nthousand or 1.7 %. During the year, the number of poultry has increased by 147.5 thousand or 2.6 %, in turn, the number of pigs has decreased \u2013 by 7.4 \n\nthousand or 2.3 %, the number of sheep \u2013 by 7.9 thousand or 7.9 %, the number of goats \u2013 by 0.2 thousand or 1.8 %, the number of horses \u2013 by 0.01 thousand \n\nor 0.1 %. \n\nWaste. In 2020 emissions is decreased by 4.6% compared to 2019. Decrease in waste disposal subsector is due to decrease of disposed waste amount. Small \n\nincrease in waste incineration and biological treatment subsectors due to increase of composting and waste incineration without energy recovery. Slight \n\nincrease of CH4 emission in the Waste Water Handling sector (5D) is due small increase of part of population non connected to centralized waste water \n\ncollection and treatment.\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

With the entire economy in transition, \n\nsome energy intensive industries reduced their activities, and this are reflected in the GHG emissions reduction.\n\nIn 2020 year, emissions from the Energy Sector have decreased by 4.21% (70,760.54 kt CO2 equivalent) compared to 2019 year (73,869.32 kt CO2 equivalent). \n\nThe consumption for 2020 year for liquids fuels decreased by 0.99% compared to 2019 year, for solids fuels decreased with 0.72% and for gaseous fuels \n\nincreased with 1.05%. The CO2 emissions for 2020 year from:\n\n- liquids fuels (refinery gas, petroleum coke, kerosene type jet fuel) decreased by 1.28% (27,923.33 kt CO2 equivalent) compared with 2019 year (28,285.66 kt \n\nCO2 equivalent);\n\n- solids fuels (coke oven coke, lignite) decreased with 27.58% (9,899.24 kt CO2 equivalent) compared with 2019 year (13,669.77 kt CO2 equivalent);\n\n- natural gas increased by 5.37% (21,493.31 kt CO2 equivalent) compared with 2019 year (20,398.18 kt CO2 equivalent).\n\nIn 2020 year, the GHG emissions from the Fugitive emissions from fuels Subsector decreased with 0.48% compared with 2019 year:\n\n- the emissions from coal mining and handling decreased with 1.72% compared with 2019; production of other bituminous coal and lignite and brown coal \n\nproduction from underground mines decreased due to the continuation of the mine closure process;\n\n- in 2020 year, the emissions from oil and natural gas category, increased with 1.71% compared with 2019; although production of oil and natural gas \n\ndecreased, the tendency to increase CO2 emissions is due to the inclusion of emissions according to ETS data.\n\n2 Industrial Processes and Product Use (CRF sector 2)\n\n2020 year approximated emissions from this sector decreased by 1.19% compared with emissions associated with 2019 year.\n\n \n\nIn 2020 year the emissions decreased compared with 2019 year due to decrease of various activities level (lime production, limestone and dolomite \n\nconsumption, soda ash production, iron and steel production, aluminium production).\n\n3 Agriculture (CRF sector 3)\n\n2020 estimated emissions from this sector remain the same compared with 2019 associated estimates.\n\n4 Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (CRF sector 4)\n\nThe difference between the 2019 and, respectively, 2020 net emissions/removals level is 11.56%. The difference is caused by the following main drivers:\n\n- the increased biomass growth according to the age class distribution into the forestland category assuming a constant harvest value for the year 2019. The \n\nharvest values for the year 2020 are not been published by the National Statistics service;\n\n- recalculations of AD (kha) for CL, GL, WL, SL and OL, due to the use of the new geospatially explicit approach 3;\n\n- estimation and use of country-specific parameters, CS, for the soil carbon pool.\n\n5 Waste (CRF sector 5)\n\nIn 2020 year, the GHG emissions from the Waste Sector decreased with 0.32% compared with 2019 year; the reasons for the variation are as follows:\n\n- the population consumption growth and increasing of waste managed sites number;\n\n- the share of methane recovery decreased because certain waste disposal sites stopped the recovery of methane;\n\n- fluctuations of the industrial production and of the population number connected to sewerage.\n\nInformation on the uncertainties associated to the LULUCF estimates\n\nThe uncertainties level associated with the approximated GHG emissions/removals estimates remains unchanged for the Forest land associated categories \n\nand gasses, when compared to the National GHG Inventory 2021. \n\nThe uncertainties associated with E (+) / R (-) levels for non-forest land are similar to the previous report: 30% -CL and GL, 100% - WL, SL and OL.\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

If this information is \n\npublicly available please include the hyperlink to the relevant website.\n\nENERGY: Based on preliminary data (and EU-ETS reports) a decrease of CO2 emission is expected in the categories 1.A.1 and 1.A.2. The decrease is mainly \n\ncaused by significant reduction of steel production. Similar trend is visible in corresponding IPPU categories. The decrease of CO2 emissions in iron and steel \n\nproduction is on a level of 870 Gg of CO2. Significant decrease is also expected in category 1.A.1.a, where the decrease of emissions is more than 520 Gg of \n\nCO2. No EU ETS data is available for categories 1.A.4. and 1.A.5, therefore the emissions are estimated mainly based on trends from previous years, thus CO2 \n\nemissions remain practically at the same level.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nTRANSPORT: Total emissions decreased as a result of lower road transportation and mobility during the COVID 19 pandemic year. There was a major decrease \n\nof fuel consumption on the level of 10%.\n\nMEMO ITEMS: Emissions are not significant and proxy is calculated based on the real consumption for the year 2020 affected by the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nIPPU: Categories 2.A, 2.B and 2.C were estimated based on the EU ETS verified GHG emissions 2020. ESD emissions in categories 2.A, 2.B, 2.C, 2.D and 2.G were \n\nextrapolated based on the 5-years average.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAGRICULTURE: The official statistics for 2020 for livestock number and animal production data were used in the 2020 proxy estimate. Activity data for 2020 \n\nconsumption of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers, sewage sludge, compost, limestone, dolomite, and urea were not available. Instead of these, extrapolated data \n\nusing the 30-years mean was used. Emissions decreased in 3.B Manure Management and in 3.A Enteric Fermentation due to the decline of livestock number \n\nin all animal subcategories. The emissions from the 3.D Agricultural Soil decreased compare to the previous submission. The main driver of emissions drop is \n\nthe significant reduction of breeding animals, despite of expectation of slight increase in inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. N2O emissions in 3.D.1.1 increased \n\ninsignificantly. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nLULUCF: A. FOREST LAND: Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O are preliminary and were calculated using new input data from 2020. Significant increase in sinks \n\nwas caused by the lower harvest of wood (lower gains) in this category.  4.B CROPLAND: Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O are preliminary and were calculated \n\nusing new input data from 2020. C. GRASSLAND: Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O are preliminary and were calculated using new input data from 2020. D. \n\nWETLANDS: Slovakia does not report this category. E. SETTLEMENTS: Emissions of CO2 and N2O are preliminary and were calculated using new input data from \n\n2020. F. OTHER LAND: Emissions of CO2 and N2O are preliminary and were calculated using new input data from 2020. G. HWP: FAO database for 2020 was not \n\navailable. Emissions were estimated using the input FAO data from 2019 and the harvested wood volume from 2020.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWASTE: The proxy estimates of emissions were prepared from analysis of 5-year data. There are no new data available, which have impact on emission \n\nestimates from waste sector as published in the last submission. Emissions from waste disposal at the same level as in 2019 and will be updated later. \n\nEmissions from 5.D wastewater are decreasing at a rate of 1,4% per year due to increasing share of connectivity to the public sewage treatment plant. The \n\nimpact of the COVID pandemic on the reduction of industrial production and wastewater was also taken into account. The statistical data on waste recovery \n\nwas not available in 5.B, therefore extrapolation was proceed using the 30-years mean. The emissions increased compare to the previous submission. \n\nIncineration of waste is on the same level according to the data available in national database of stationary sources.\n\f\n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 3/2021 83 \n\nIceland (submitted by country)  \n\n \n\nYear 2020\n\n(Sheet 1 of 1) Submission 2021\n\nCountry Iceland\n\nGeographical scope\n(4)\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS SOURCE AND CO2\n(1) CH4 N2O HFCs PFCs SF6\n\nUnspecified \n\nmix of HFCs \n\nand PFCs\n\nNF3 Total ETS non-ETS\n\nSINK CATEGORIES\n\nTotal (net emissions)\n(1)\n\n9 020,68 3 975,36 288,53 174,92 95,67 3,15 NO NO 13 558,31\n\n1.

In the IPPU sector there is a decrease in the 2C2 Metal sector, as one company closed its production temporary due to the Covid-19 \n\npandemic. The emissions from HFCs (2F) decreased as well which is due to a lower import in 2013 (and a peak in emissions in 2019 due to high imports in \n\n2012). In the Waste sector the increase in mainly due to emissions from SWDS (5A) as a decrease in flared/recovered methane was reported.\n\n(4)    \nWhere applicable: for Member States with geographical scopes which differ between the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-territory scope, and the Party coverage under the Convention, please clarify the \n\ngeographical scope of the Proxy GHG inventory submitted under the EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation.\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

With regards to indirect CO2, they are an integral part of the \n\nemission estimates for each source category at the most dissaggregated level. Please see NIR chapter 9.3 for further details. Preliminary estimates for 2020 \n\nare 285.88 kt CO2. The split in row 66 between ETS and non-ETS does not include these indirect CO2 emissions, but these are included in row 68 which is the \n\napprpriate national total for Norway. 3. Please note that the t-1 emissions reported here are not directly comparable to the t-3 emissions reported to the \n\nUNFCCC in April. An error  has been discovered in the inventory that will increase the previously reported emisisons in 2019 with about 1400 kt CO2 \n\nequivalents. The error has been corrected for the 2020 emisisons reported here. 4. Nevertheless, taking the corrections into account, the 2020 emissions are \n\nestimated to be about  1700 kt CO2 eq lower than the 2019 emissions. These reductions are primarily within oil and gas extraction, industry, road traffic and \n\naviation. 5. 2019  figures used for memo item on \"Long-term storage of C in waste disposal sites\".\n\nBrief description of the key drivers underpinning the increase or decrease in GHG emissions in t-1 (proxy) compared to t-2 (inventory).

Between 2005 and 2019, agricultural emissions remained stable. Based on national projections, only a modest EU-level decline of 2% is expected by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. If currently planned additional measures are implemented, a 5% reduction is expected. These projected declines would be insufficient to meet most Member States\u2019 binding annual targets, highlighting the need for further action if the EU is to meet its goal of climate neutrality by 2050.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||Energy consumption from agriculture/forestry/fishing||CH4 from enteric fermentation||Manure management||N2O from agricultural soils||Other||Total agriculture (excl. energy) with additional measures||Total agriculture (excl. energy) with existing measures|\n|2005||84||168||61||151||13|\n|2006||81||167||61||149||13|\n|2007||79||168||61||151||14|\n|2008||79||167||59||150||13|\n|2009||78||166||59||147||13|\n|2010||80||164||57||147||13|\n|2011||78||162||57||147||14|\n|2012||76||162||56||147||14|\n|2013||76||163||55||150||15|\n|2014||75||164||56||154||15|\n|2015||74||166||57||153||15|\n|2016||75||166||56||154||15|\n|2017||75||166||56||157||15|\n|2018||77||166||56||154||15|\n|2019||77||164||56||152||14||389||389|\n|2020||387||388|\n|2021||385||387|\n|2022||384||387|\n|2023||383||387|\n|2024||381||386|\n|2025||380||386|\n|2026||379||386|\n|2027||377||386|\n|2028||376||385|\n|2029||375||385|\n|2030||373||385|\n|2031||373||385|\n|2032||373||385|\n|2033||372||385|\n|2034||372||385|\n|2035||372||385|\n|2036||372||385|\n|2037||371||385|\n|2038||371||385|\n|2039||371||385|\n|2040||371||385|\n|2041|\n|2042|\n|2043|\n|2044|\n|2045|\n|2046|\n|2047|\n|2048|\n|2049|\n|2050|\nThe European Green Deal sets out the EU\u2019s ambition to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. Key to this is reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including from agriculture. Agricultural GHG emissions are covered by the EU Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) and Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which set annual targets for each Member State for the periods 2013-2020 and 2021-2030, respectively . Emissions from transport, buildings and waste are also covered by national ESD and ESR targets, which collectively aim to reduce total EU emissions from the sectors covered by around 10% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.\nCH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and N2O emissions from soils are responsible for more than 80% of total agricultural GHG emissions. CH4 from manure management is the third most important source of emissions, accounting for about 10%. The remaining sources make relatively small contributions, accounting for less than 10% of agricultural GHG emissions in total.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, the EU\u2019s agricultural GHG emissions changed very little, and this trend is expected to continue, with Member State projections indicating that there will be only a modest 2% decline in agricultural GHG emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. If additional measures currently planned by Member States are implemented, this would increase to a decline of 5%.\nBased on these projected reductions in agricultural emissions, Member States will have to achieve much greater reductions in other ESR sectors if they are to meet national targets. A European Commission impact assessment highlights the challenges in further reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions from agriculture . Measures commonly supported by the common agricultural policy have not been effective so far, while support for some effective measures, including the use of foraged legumes, and improved manure treatment and fertiliser application, has been sporadic . Reducing EU production, especially of livestock, would directly reduce agricultural GHG emissions. However, to avoid \u2018leakage\u2019 of emissions to outside the EU, this would need to be matched by a decrease in EU demand, through less food waste and a shift in diet away from meat and dairy towards plant-based protein sources .\n|Country||2005-2019||Projected 2005-2030 with existing measures||Projected 2005-2030 with additional measures|\n|Croatia||-17.7||-20.5||-25.4|\n|Malta||-16.6||-27.9||-27.9|\n|Greece||-11.9||2.1||2.1|\n|Italy||-8.7||-13.4||-13.4|\n|Romania||-8.1||5.6||2|\n|France||-4.4||-7.2||-7.2|\n|Belgium||-4||-7.9||-18.1|\n|Cyprus||-3.9||-8.4||-8.9|\n|Denmark||-2.7||-8.2||-8.2|\n|Germany||-2.3||-9.5||-9.5|\n|Spain||-2.3||-5.6||-16.5|\n|EU-27||-1.8||-2||-5|\n|Sweden||-1.4||-13.3||-13.3|\n|Czechia||-0.6||1.4||1.4|\n|Netherlands||-0.2||-0.6||-1.3|\n|Sloveia||0.3||5.1||-0.8|\n|Finland||1.4||-2.1||-9.6|\n|Austria||1.9||3.6||-6.4|\n|Poland||2.5||3||3|\n|Portugal||2.7||-1.8||-4.4|\n|Lithuania||4.7||-0.2||-8.1|\n|Slovakia||5.6||-5.6||-5.6|\n|Ireland||6.2||10.1||-5.1|\n|Luxembourg||10.2||5.8||-18.9|\n|Hungary||16.2||22.4||14.4|\n|Latvia||22.8||54.2||44.4|\n|Bulgaria||24.7||48.1||48.1|\n|Estonia||27||32.8||32.8|\nAlthough agricultural GHG emissions changed very little at the EU level between 2005 and 2019, trends varied widely at the national level, with emissions increasing in 14 and decreasing in 13 Member States. For instance, emissions decreased by more than 10% in Croatia, Greece and Malta, and increased by more than 10 % in Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Luxembourg.\nBased on projections, most Member States anticipate a continuation of past trends if existing measures remain in place. However, some Member States anticipate a reversal of trends. For instance, although emissions decreased in Greece and Romania between 2005 and 2019, these countries predict that emissions will begin to increase if only existing measures remain in place.\nThe planned implementation of additional measures is expected to have an especially strong impact on agricultural emissions in Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain, namely a reduction of 10% or more by 2030 relative to projections based on only existing measures. Twelve Member States have not reported any planned additional measures expected to reduce emissions more than existing measures.", "ETC/CME Report 8/2020: Trends and projections under the Effort Sharing Legislation. Overview on developments and drivers.26 Jan 2021\nThis report provides an analysis of the progress of the European Union, its Member States as well as Iceland, Norway and United Kingdom in reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Effort Sharing legislation between 2005 and 2030. The Effort Sharing legislation covers greenhouse gas emissions in transport, buildings, agriculture, waste and small industry that are not included in the EU emission trading system. The report also discusses the sectoral development of greenhouse gas emissions. It attempts to identify the main quantified policies and measures driving emission reductions at national level with a specific focus on mitigation effects of planned policies and measures.\nPrepared by: Jakob Graichen (\u00d6ko-Institut), Sabine Gores (\u00d6ko-Institut), Carmen Schmid (UBA Vienna), Nicole Mandl (UBA Vienna)\nPublished by: ETC/CME, January 2021, 50 pp.\nPublication number: Eionet report - ETC/CME 8/2020\n\nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 - January 2021 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n \n   \n\nTrends and projections under the Effort \n\nSharing Legislation \n\nOverview on developments and drivers \n \n\nAuthors:  \n\nJakob Graichen (\u00d6ko-Institut), Sabine Gores (\u00d6ko-Institut), Carmen Schmid \n\n(UBA Vienna), Nicole Mandl (UBA Vienna) \n\nETC/CME consortium partners: AETHER, Interprofessional Technical Centre for Studies on Air \nPollution (CITEPA), Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (CHMI), Energy and Environmental \nStudies and Software Development (EMISIA), Institute for Applied Ecology (\u00d6KO-INSTITUT), \n\u00d6KO-RECHERCHE, Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), Netherlands Environmental \nAssessment Agency (PBL), National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), \nEnvironment Agency Austria (UBA), Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO) \n\f\n \n\n \n\nCover photo \u00a9 Des Blenkinsopp (cc-by-sa/2.0) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEuropean Topic Centre on Climate  \n\nchange mitigation and energy \n\nBoeretang 200 \nB-2400 Mol, Belgium \nTel.: +32 14 33 59 77 \nWeb: www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-cme \nEmail: etccme@vito.be \n\n \n\nLegal notice \nThe contents of this publication do not necessarily reflect the official opinions of the European Commission or other institutions \nof the European Union.

and energy (ETC/CME). The authors of the report were Jakob Graichen and \nSabine Gores from ETC/CME Partner \u00d6ko-Institut (Germany) as well as Nicole Mandl and Carmen \nSchmidt from Umweltbundesamt (Austria).  \n \nThe EEA project manager was Melanie Sporer.

The Effort Sharing legislations covers greenhouse gas emissions in the transport, \nbuildings, agriculture, waste and small industry not included in the EU emission trading system.  \n \nThe report also discusses the sectoral development of greenhouse gas emissions by country and tries to \nidentify the main quantified policies and measures driving emission reductions. For this reason, reported \nadditional and planned policies and measures are analysed by sector and Member State. While \nquantified effects of additional and planned policies and measures of all Member States are analysed to \nthe extent possible, more details are presented for Member States reporting the highest emission \nreduction effects in each sector. The report focusses on the sectors transport, building and agriculture, \nbeing the largest sectors included in the Effort Sharing. For waste and small industries no in-depth \nassessment was performed. \n \nThis report is based on information provided by EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and the United \nKingdom in their submissions under the EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) in the years 2019 \nand 2020. Both submissions were prepared before the COVID-19 virus hit Europe and do not reflect any \neffects of this pandemic. The submitted emission projections have been prepared before the publication \nof the European Green Deal, and more recent achievements such as the European Climate Law, \nenshrining the 2050 carbon neutrality target for the EU into legislation and the 2030 Climate Target Plan, \nincreasing the ambition levels of the EU\u2019s 2030 targets. They therefore reflect the European climate \npolicy architecture in view of a 40 % reduction target of greenhouse gases compared to 1990. \n\nMain findings \n\nSurplus and deficit of annual emission allocations at EU level \n\nThe national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for the years 2021-2030 were defined in the \n\nEffort Sharing Regulation (ESR) and are translated into annual emission allocations (AEAs)1. Compared to \n\nthe sum of national AEA\u2019s for the entire period from 2021 to 2030, the emission projections with existing \n\npolicies and measures (WEM scenario) would result in a total mitigation gap of about 1 300 Mt CO2e by \n\n2030. Considering the additional effect of planned policies and measures in the with additional measures \n\n(WAM scenario) of the reported greenhouse gas emission projections, the resulting emission reductions \n\nwould be sufficient to meet the obligations under the Effort Sharing Regulation and lead to a surplus of \n\nAEA\u2019s at EU level.  \n\nBulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden did not report a planned measures \n\n(WAM) scenario in their submissions under the MMR by March 2020 but did include such a scenario in \n\ntheir National Energy and Climate Plans (NECP). Taking these scenarios into account, the cumulated \n\nsurplus by 2030 would amount to 650 Mt CO2e. The resulting overall reduction of 32 % compared to \n\n2005 would overachieve the EU-wide minimum reductions of 30 % for emissions under the ESR (EC \n\n2020). This is an important step in the right direction for the contribution of the ESR to the very recently \n\nincreased ambition level of the EU\u2019s 2030 target.  \n\n                                                           \n(1)  The annual emission allocations (i.e. emission quantities assigned to Member States) were published on 16 \n\nDecember 2020 when the assessment of this report was already concluded. The AEAs used in this report \nare therefore approximated estimates calculated according to the methodology used in the EEA\u2019s Trends \nand Projections report 2020. \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 2 \n\nImportantly, the annual surplus in earlier years is higher than at the end of the period. This means that \nsuch an AEA surplus at the end of the ESR period would only be achieved, if planned policies and \nmeasures were implemented already in the beginning of the period. \n\nSurplus and deficit of annual emission allocations at national level \n\nUnder MMR reporting, Member States project that the impact of their planned and additional measures \nwould reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Effort Sharing sectors by approx. 1 600 Mt CO2e in the \nperiod 2021-2030. This difference between the WEM and WAM scenario is mainly due to France, Spain, \nItaly, Poland and Belgium who together intend to achieve 80 % of this additional emission reduction. \nGermany projects a gap between its ESR targets and its scenario with existing measures of almost \n400 Mt CO2e, which is by far the largest deficit of all Member States. Germany has not provided a WAM \nscenario under the MMR but has done so in its NECP.  \n\nSectoral Development in EU Member States \n\nGeneral analysis:  \n \nInformation on policies and measures (PaMs) and their quantified effects is significantly underreported \nby Member States.   It is therefore very difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of specific \nPaMs at a national level. Also, the datasets from Member States often show inconsistencies, such as the \ntotal PaMs effect being larger than the total effect of the WAM scenario for 2030 without any \ninformation given on the reasons for this. Member States will need to improve the quality of their \nreporting in terms of completeness, consistency and transparency to ensure that the impacts of their \npolicies can be evaluated. Even though there is only limited information available on the expected \neffects of specific PaMs in the future, it is clear from this analysis that the ambition in all Effort Sharing \nsectors needs to be further increased.  \n \nTransport: \n \nRoad transport is responsible for the largest part of transport emissions in the EU. An increasing \ntransport demand driven by GDP growth has offset efficiency improvements in the transport sector in \nthe past. In addition, the average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars increased in recent years due \nto an increase in new registrations in the SUV segment. \n \nIn the greenhouse gas emission projections with existing measures (WEM scenario), ten Member States \nreport increasing emissions until 2030 compared to 2018. Sixteen Member States reported additional \nmeasures (WAM scenario), of which five projected increasing emissions until 2030 even when \nconsidering their planned measures. Emission projections with additional measures show that in 2030 \nthe EU will only reach the emission levels of 1990. Thus, a necessary turnaround of the trend is still not \nnoticeable, and it is evident from recent trends and projections that the currently reported existing and \nplanned measures do not sufficiently lead to the required decarbonisation of the transport sector.  \n \nCountries with the highest relative emission reductions in the WAM scenario in 2030 (Spain, Belgium and \nEstonia) have reported diverse additional measures, such as the further increase of bio-fuel shares, \nincreased road pricing, stronger promotion of electric vehicles and further modal shift to public or nonmotorised transport often with a focus on urban areas. There is no clear indication which of the planned \nmeasures lead to the highest emission reductions, as specific information on the mitigation impact per \nPolicy and Measure (PaM) is not available for all reported PaMs. However, in all three countries\u2019 reports \nthe use of biofuels is highlighted to have a significant impact on the emissions reductions. \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 3 \n\nBuildings: \n \nMost of the emissions in the building sector result from space heating. In the past years, emissions \ndecreased due to warmer winter temperatures concomitant with decreased heating demand and due to \na fuel switch from liquid and solid fuels to natural gas. Also, technological developments such as more \nefficient heating systems and thermal insulation led to lower energy consumption for space heating. \nHowever, emission reductions were partly offset due to the increased number of dwellings and larger \nfloor areas of buildings. \n \nCurrent emission projections show that emissions will continue to decrease following more or less the \nsame trend as in the historical years; with the additional measures, further emission reductions of -21 % \nare projected to be achieved by 2030. The historical and projected emission trends in the building sector \nshow that effective measures have already been put in place by many Member States, but not all \ncountries have yet reported on additional measures in the building sector to further increase their \nambition. In any case, further measures are needed to reduce emissions, especially when rebound and \ncounterbalancing effects cancel out efficiency improvements. Nine Member States still report increasing \nemissions in the WEM scenario and five countries also report increasing emissions in the WAM scenario. \n \nThe focus of the countries with highest relative emission reductions in the WAM scenario in 2030 \ncompared to the WEM scenario (Belgium, Spain and Hungary) lies on energy efficiency measures namely \nto accelerate building renovation rates, but also to promote efficient heating systems. Another focus is \nthe increase of low carbon fuels (including biomass and biofuels). The three countries do not provide \nsufficient PaM - specific information on the impacts and therefore it is unclear how much these \nmeasures contribute to the emission reductions. \n \nAgriculture: \n \nEnteric fermentation from cattle and direct N2O emissions from agricultural soils are responsible for the \nlargest part of emission from the agriculture sector, but also for the largest reductions in historical \nagricultural emissions. Since 2005, emissions in this sector have been close to stable in the EU, meaning \nthat the agriculture sector hardly contributed to reductions in the Effort Sharing sectors during that time. \n \nIn the WEM scenario 13 Member States report increasing emissions until 2030 compared to 2018. \nEmission projections with additional measures show that in 2030 the EU will reach 25% below emission \nlevels of 1990, only anticipating a reduction of 4 % during the period 2018-2030.  \n \nCroatia, Spain and France, the countries with the highest relative emission reductions in the WAM \nscenario in 2030, have reported diverse additional measures, mainly targeting the reduction of \nfertilizer/manure use, the improvement of animal waste management systems, the improvement of \nmanagement of organic soils and the improvement of livestock management. The three countries do not \nprovide sufficient information on the PaM - specific impacts and therefore it is unclear how much these \nmeasures contribute to the emission reductions. \n \nWaste: \n \nSolid waste disposal and wastewater treatment are the main contributors to emissions in this sector. \nCompared to 1990, emission in the sector decreased by 36 % until 2019. Except for Croatia and Malta all \nMember States project a continuous decline of emissions in the WEM scenario until 2030.  \n \nSmall industry:  \n \nThe sector \u201cSmall industry\u201d contain emissions from smaller energy and industrial activities, which are not \ncovered under the EU ETS. There are no specific policies and measures reported which are specifically \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 4 \n\ntargeting Effort Sharing emissions of small energy industries, manufacturing and construction or process \nemissions, but there are many policies and measures reported to reduce F-Gases, which are relevant for \nprojected emission reductions in many Member States. Highest absolute and relative emission decreases \nare projected by France, followed by Slovakia, if relative reductions are considered.  \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 5 \n\n1 Introduction  \n\nThe Effort Sharing legislation sets national targets for EU Member States. It covers emissions which are \nneither included under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) nor under the Land use and Land use \nChange and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation. Historical emission reductions under the Effort Sharing \nlegislation have been considerably lower than those under the EU ETS: While emissions decreased by \n33 % between 2005 and 2019 under the EU ETS in EU-27, the reduction under the Effort Sharing \nlegislation was only 10 % in the same period. While these reductions will be sufficient to achieve the EU\u2019s \n2020 reduction target, emission reductions especially under the Effort Sharing need to speed up \nconsiderably to deliver the emission cuts foreseen by 2030. Effort Sharing emissions have significantly \ndifferent drivers and reduction potentials. Reducing these emissions to meet national Effort Sharing \ntargets requires a diversified and well adapted policy mix at the national level. Having reported a large \nnumber of planned policies and measures under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation in 2019 and \npartly in 2020, EU Member States must now fully implement them to allow the EU to deliver on its \ndecarbonization objectives and need to add further planned measures for higher reduction needs.  \n \n\n \n \nThis report provides an updated overview of sectoral trends, projections of greenhouse gas emissions, \nand planned policies and measures in the EU Effort Sharing sectors. It complements  the EEA\u2019s recent \nTrends and Projections report (EEA 2020h), which assesses progress towards the EU\u2019s climate and energy \ntargets, and the EEA\u2019s Trends and drivers of EU greenhouse gas emissions report which analysis the \ndevelopment of GHG emissions since 1990 (EEA 2020f) . The findings are based on preliminary estimates \nof greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 (proxy data) and historic and projected greenhouse gas emissions, \nas well as policies and measures that Member States reported to the EEA in March 2019 under the \nMonitoring Mechanism Regulation. The EEA has published historic emissions (EEA 2020c), projections by \nMember State (EEA 2020b) and the database of policies and measures (EEA 2019a) online as interactive \ntools.  \n \n\nBox 1 Effort Sharing legislation \n\nThe EU\u2019s Effort Sharing legislation aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors that are not included in \nthe EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). This represents a wide range of sources, such as petrol and diesel \nuse for road transport, energy use for heating and cooling in households and commercial buildings, animal \ndigestion and fertilizer use in agriculture, waste treatment and small industries. Altogether, these emissions \nmake up about 59 % of total greenhouse gas emissions at EU level. The Effort Sharing legislation does not \napply to emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), which are covered by \nthe Kyoto Protocol and from 2021 by the LULUCF Regulation. It also does not apply to emissions from \ninternational maritime transport nor to aviation outside of the scope of the EU ETS (apart from N2O and CH4 \nfrom domestic aviation). Until 2020 it excludes NF3 emissions, while from 2021 onwards these are included. \nThe legislation sets national annual greenhouse gas emission targets for the periods 2013-2020 (Effort Sharing \nDecision, ESD) and 2021-2030 (Effort Sharing Regulation, ESR). These annual targets are different for each \ncountry: The national emission targets for 2020 range from a 20 % reduction by 2020 (from 2005 levels) for \nthe richest country to a 20 % increase for the poorest one, Bulgaria. Taken together, the national 2020 targets \nrepresent a 10 % reduction in EU Effort Sharing emissions compared with 2005, which is in line with the EU \ntarget of a 20 % reduction in all greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (including those in the EU ETS), compared \nwith 1990. \nFor 2030, the national emission targets range from 0 % (no change from 2005 levels) to 40 % below 2005 \nlevels (applicable to Effort Sharing emissions only). These targets correspond to an EU reduction of 30 % from \n2005 levels by 2030, as a contribution towards the current reduction target of 40 % below 1990 levels for all \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States and the United Kingdom. \n \nFor further information about the Effort Sharing legislation see EEA (2020e). \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 6 \n\nThe report can be seen in the context of two other reports on trends and drivers of emissions under the \nEffort Sharing legislation, published both in 2018 by the ETC/ACM. While the first report (ETC/ACM \n2018a) looked into drivers of specific sectors, the second (ETC/ACM 2018b) analysed sectoral historical \nand projected trends. This third report includes an update of the sectoral trend analysis and takes a \nthorough look into reported additional policies and measures and their reported effects on emission \ndevelopment.   \n \n\n \n  \n\nBox 2 Brexit, COVID-19 and the European Green Deal \n\nThis report is based on the information reported by EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Norway and \nIceland under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation in 2019 and 2020. It is based on the political framework \nagreed prior to the European Green Deal: A total greenhouse gas reduction of 40% below 1990 levels for the \nEU 28. Since then, the political and economic situation has changed considerably. \nThe United Kingdom has left the EU at the end of January 2020. During the transition period until 31 \nDecember 2020 the UK will continue to apply EU law including the Effort Sharing Decision. In this report the \nterms \u201cEU\u201d and \u201cMember State\u201d only apply to the remaining 27 countries. The discussion of the 2020 target \nincludes the UK; assessments looking at the period until 2030 are based on the EU-27 only.  \nIn December 2019 the European Commission published the European Green Deal. In it, the Commission \nproposes to increase the EU\u2019s 2030 GHG reduction target to at least 50 % and towards 55 % below 1990 levels \nin order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (European Commission (EC) 2019). In its Climate Target Plan the \nCommission proposes an EU-wide GHG target of 55% below 1990 levels (European Commission (EC) 2020). \nCompared to the current targets the scope is expanded: it includes intra-EU international shipping and \nLULUCF. The accompanying Impact Assessment underlines the feasibility of the new target but does not yet \npropose a new climate architecture. It opens the discussion by exploring different options to achieve the \nenhanced target. While the European council followed this proposal, the European Parliament agreed to a \n60 % reduction target. The final decision on level and scope of the target will be agreed in trialogue \ndiscussions around the end of the year 2020. Only afterwards the design of the climate target architecture is \nunder consideration, in June 2021 proposals are expected by the European Commission. \nThe reporting by Member States under the MMR in 2019 and 2020 does not yet include the European Green \nDeal and enhanced targets for the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing legislation. This report therefore \nmainly looks at the progress towards the current targets with some insights on raising ambition where \nappropriate. \nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on GHG emissions in 2020 from the EU and the \nUnited Kingdom. The European Commission expects the EU-27 economy to shrink by 7.4 per cent in 2020 and \na recovery of 4.1 per cent in 2021 (EC 2020). GHG will follow a similar development. The information by \nMember States and the United Kingdom used in this report does not yet include the impacts of the pandemic. \nProjections for the short-term will therefore be much higher than the real development; the impact of \nCOVID-19 on 2030 emissions depends not only on the speed of recovery but also on the type of recovery: the \ngreener the recovery the lower the mid-term emissions. \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 7 \n\n2 Progress in reducing emissions under the Effort Sharing  \n\n2.1 Surplus and deficit of annual emission allocations at EU level \n\nThe Effort Sharing legislation covers emissions that are neither covered under the EU ETS nor related to \nthe LULUCF sector. These emissions are produced by a diverse range of sectors and activities, including \nroad transport, energy consumption in buildings, agriculture (animals and soils), smaller industrial \ninstallations, smaller energy generation facilities and waste management. These represent altogether \nabout 59 % of total EU GHG emissions.  \n \nThe legislation sets annual emission trajectories for each Member State for the periods 2013-2020 (ESD) \n(EU, 2013b, 2017a) and 2021-2030 (Effort Sharing Regulation, ESR) (EU, 2018g). These are translated into \nnational annual emission allocations (AEAs) by implementing decisions2. Member States should stay \nwithin the limits of their allocations or can make use of several flexibilities stipulated in the \ncorresponding legislation. The responsibility lies with Member States to implement a combination of \nnational and EU-driven policies and measures to meet their commitments under the Effort Sharing \nlegislation.  \n \nIn 2019, Effort Sharing emissions aggregated at EU-28 (EU and UK) level were 12 % below 2005 ESD \nemissions. With the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 emissions reductions will exceed the \noverall EU-wide minimum reduction of 10 % of emissions under the Effort Sharing legislation (20132020). From 2021 on, the legislation only refers to EU-27; the difference between the two scopes is \ndepicted in Figure 1.  \n \nThe decrease of Effort Sharing emissions is projected to continue: aggregated national projections with \nexisting and adopted policies and measures (WEM scenario) that were reported by Member States under \nthe MMR result in a 18 % reduction of Effort Sharing emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 base year \nemissions. If additional polices and measures are considered, emissions are projected to decrease by \n29 % compared to ESD base year emissions3.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(2)  For the years 2021-2030, AEAs were not available at the time when the assessment for this report was \n\nperformed. They have therefore been calculated with ESD base year emissions 2005 and latest inventory \ndata, see EEA (2020i).  \n\n(3)  ESR base year emissions will be different to ESD base year emissions, they are fixed in the Implementing \nDecision on setting out the annual emission allocations of the Member States for the period from 2021 to \n2030 pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842. The ESR base year emissions were not available when the \nassessment of this report was performed.  \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 8 \n\nFigure 1 Greenhouse gas emission trends, Effort Sharing targets and projections \u2018with existing\u2019 \nand \u2018with additional\u2019 measures, 2005-2030, EU and the United Kingdom. \n\n \nNotes: Historic emissions for the EU and the UK are represented in solid lines. Projections from 2015 to 2030 are represented \nin dashed lines (EU only). Annual targets under the Effort Sharing legislation are represented as bullets. The depicted targets are \nthose in force in 2020, i.e. a 30 % ESR target for 2030 in line with an overall EU ambition of 40 %. Until 2020 the targets include \nthe United Kingdom, afterwards the targets are for the EU only. \nSource:  EEA (2020h). \n\n \n \nThe Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) allows Member States to use flexibility provisions to meet their annual \ntargets, with certain limitations (EEA 2020h): \n\n\u2022 Within a Member State, any overachievement in a year during the period 2013-2019 can be carried \n\nover to subsequent years, up to 2020. Up to 5 % of a Member State\u2019s annual emission allocation \n\n(AEA) may be carried forward to the following year during the period 2013-2019. Member States \n\nmay transfer up to 5 % of their AEAs to other Member States, which may use this emission allocation \n\nuntil 2020 (ex-ante). Any overachievement in a year during the period 2013-2019 may also be \n\ntransferred to other Member States, which may use this emission allocation until 2020 (ex post). The \n\nlatter can take place only after emission data for the relevant year have been confirmed.  \n\nThe Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) for 2030 targets maintains existing flexibilities under the current ESD \nwith some adjustments: \n\n\u2022 Banking of unused AEAs is capped at a total of 30 % of the cumulative AEA of the year in question \n\nfrom 2022 to 2029. \n\n\u2022 Borrowing is limited to 10 % of the AEA of the following year from 2021 to 2025 and to 5 % from \n\n2026 to 2029. \n\n\u2022 The limit for transfers of AEAs to other Member States is increased to 10 % of the AEA of respective \n\nyears in the period 2026-2030.

The Member States having this option are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, \n\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Malta and Sweden. \n\nEligible Member States needed to notify the Commission by 31 December 2019 how much of the \n\nmaximum amount of this flexibility they intend to use during the Effort Sharing compliance period \n\n2021-2030. Iceland and Norway are also eligible as they have agreed with the EU to implement the \n\nESR. \n\nThe maximum limit that can be used annually in the period 2021-2030 is set at 2 % of each country\u2019s \n\nEffort Sharing emissions in 2005, except for Ireland, Luxembourg and Iceland, which are allowed a \n\nlimit of up to 4 %. The total maximum amount for all 11 eligible countries is limited to 107 million \n\ntons. Six Member States, as well as Iceland and Norway, have given notice that they intend to use \n\ntheir full amount of this flexibility, whereas Belgium intends to use 1.89 %. The Netherlands and \n\nSweden have decided not to use the flexibility. Member States may request downward revisions of \n\ntheir percentages for later years during the compliance period in 2024 and 2027, respectively.  \n\n\u2022 There is a new flexibility to use credits from the land use sector. Land mitigation units (LMUs) from \n\nafforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland allow Member States to use up to \n\n280 million credits over the entire period 2021-2030 in the whole of the EU to comply with their \n\nnational targets. All Member States are eligible to make use of this flexibility, but Member States \n\nwith a larger proportion of emissions from agriculture have greater access to it. In line with EU \n\nleaders\u2019 guidance, this recognizes that there is a relatively low mitigation potential for emissions \n\nfrom the agriculture sector. Iceland and Norway also have access to this flexibility since both are part \n\nof the ESR and Land use, land use change and forestry Regulation for the period 2021-2030. \n\nFigure 2 shows the annual and cumulated difference between projected Effort Sharing emissions 2021 \nand 2030 and the AEAs for the EU-27. It shows the results of the MMR scenario with existing policies and \nmeasures (WEM scenario) and with additional policies and measures (WAM scenario)4. If emissions are \nbelow annual AEAs, a surplus is depicted with positive bars, while higher emissions than AEAs result in \nnegative bars. The lines show the cumulated surplus or deficit, if the effects are summed up from one \nyear to the next.  \n \nIn case of the WEM scenario, emissions are above the annual emission allocations for all years after 2021 \n(compare to Figure 1). Consequently, the line with cumulated results ends up with a deficit of \n1 285 Mt CO2e. But if additional measures are considered, annual emissions are below annual emission \nallocations for all years. These additional measures lead to a total cumulated surplus of about \n300 Mt CO2e in 20305. The annual surplus in earlier years is higher than at the end of the period. This \nshows that the early implementation of additional policies and measures and taking in early reduction \neffects are essential to achieve the targets set under the Effort Sharing Regulation. If additional policies \nand measures were implemented as planned in WAM scenarios reported under the MMR in 2019 and \n2020, an AEA surplus would result at the end of the ESR period.  \n \nThis result was calculated even though not all Member States reported additional policies and measures. \nBulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Malta, Netherlands and Sweden did not report an emission \nscenario including additional policies and measures (WAM scenario). Out of these, all but Malta have \n\n                                                           \n(4)  While compliance under the Effort Sharing Decision takes place on an annual basis, compliance under the \n\nEffort Sharing Regulation takes place in two periods: 2021-2025 in 2026 and 2026-2030 in 2032. \nNevertheless, annual differences are considered here.  \n\n(5) For this calculation, the ETS flexibility has been included as reported on page 3. The LULUCF flexibility has \nnot been considered; actual use depends on the actual removals in a compliance period and emissions from \nthe ESR sectors. Maximum usage is 280 million allowances, but it is unlikely that Member States will be \nable to use the full amount.  \n\n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 10 \n\nprovided updated projections in their National Energy and Climate Plans to the Commission mid-2020 \n(NECPs)6.

This means that the emissions covered under the ESR need to be \nreduced by 741 Mt CO2e between 2005 and 2030. So far, a third of these needed reductions \n(250 Mt CO2e) have been cut. Looking ahead, Member States expect to reduce emissions by about \n200 Mt CO2e in the WEM scenario and by another 260 Mt CO2e in the WAM scenario. With this, the ESR \nemissions would fall short of the 30 % reduction by 33 Mt CO2e. However, additional contributions \nreported by seven Member States in their NECPs could turn this gap into an overachievement.8  \n \nThe buildings sector has contributed to more than half of the greenhouse gas emission reductions \nbetween 2005 and 2019, which is by far the highest share. Small industry9 with 21 % of the reductions \nachieved so far and waste with 17 % are the second and third largest contributors to past emission \nreductions in the Effort Sharing sectors. The transport sector, despite being responsible for 36 % of ESR \nemissions in 2019, has so far only reduced emissions by 13 Mt CO2e, merely 5 % of the total Effort \nSharing reduction between 2005 and 2019. Transport is also the sector with the highest intended \nreduction in the future: 50 % of the additional reduction is planned to take place in this sector. The waste \nsector has achieved the highest relative reduction by 2019, 27 % below 2005, followed by the buildings \nsector with a reduction of 20 %. The agriculture sector, which is responsible for 18 % of the ESR \nemissions, only plays a minor both for the achieved and planned reductions until 2030.  \n \n \n\n                                                           \n(8)  See footnote 6 for more details on the NECP projections. \n(9)  The sector \u201cSmall industry\u201d contains emissions from industrial activities not covered by the ETS and \n\nemissions from installations that fall below the minimum threshold for participation in the ETS.  \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 14 \n\nFigure 5 Historic and projected developments in the Effort Sharing sector for EU-27, absolute  \n\n \nNote:  This graph is based on the latest projections submitted by countries in 2020.

The idea is to better understand the relation between these effects and \nreported GHG projections. The analysis focusses on the three most important Effort Sharing sectors: \ntransport, buildings and agriculture. For the other two sectors, waste and small industry, no analysis of \npolicies and measures has been conducted.  \n\n3.2 Transport \n\n3.2.1 EU trends along the timeline \n\nIn the transport sector emissions in EU increased by 22 % between 1990 and 2018. Current projections \nshow that with existing policies and measures, in 2030 emissions will still be above the level of 1990 \nemissions. With additional policies and measures, emissions will decrease after 2020 and reach the level \nof 1990. Recent analyses by EEA show that efficiency improvements in the transport sector are often \noffset by growing demand for transportation which is strongly linked to the GDP development (EEA \n2019e). Road transport causes the majority of transport emissions (about 70 %) due to a significant rise \nin passenger-kilometres and ton-kilometres (EEA 2019c). The latest EEA report on the CO2 monitoring of \ncars (EEA 2020d) mentions that between 2016 and 2018 the average CO2 emissions from new passenger \ncars increased, after a period of decline from 2010-2016, due to the growing share of petrol cars, \nespecially in the SUV segment, in new registrations and a low share of zero and low-emission vehicles. In \naddition, this report concludes that the average fuel efficiency of fuel and petrol cars has worsened in \n2018 compared to 2017.  \n \n \n\nFigure 7  Historical and projected developments in the transport sector for EU-27 1990-2030 \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030\n\nEf\nfo\n\nrt\n S\n\nh\na\n\nri\nn\n\ng \nem\n\nis\nsi\n\no\nn\n\ns \n[M\n\nt C\nO\n\n2\n e\n\nq\n]\n\nTransport\n\nWAM WEM Historic\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 16 \n\n3.2.2 Projection of progress by Member States \n\nAt EU level, emissions decreased by 2 % between 2005 and 2018.10 In 12 Member States emissions \nincreased in this time period and in 15 Member States emission decreases have been reported.  \nIn projections with existing policies and measures, there are still 10 Member States showing increasing \nemission. This number is reduced to three Member States (Cyprus, Hungary and Romania) for \nprojections with additional policies and measures (see Figure 8); Bulgaria and Poland did not submit a \nWAM scenario.  \n \nIn the transport sector, the highest absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions have been projected in \nFrance, Spain and Italy, all including planned policies and measures (see Figure 8). These emissions \nreductions are between 37 and 21 Mt CO2e. In Italy, the historical emission reductions between 2005 \nand 2018 were about the same level as what is projected for 2018-2030, while the historical emission \nreductions were less than half of the projected reductions in Spain and France.  \n \nThe three Member States (Cyprus, Hungary and Romania) with projected emission increases in both the \nWEM and WAM scenario showed historical emission increases between 2005 and 2018 as well. \nEspecially the historical emission increases in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria were higher than projected \nincreases with additional policies and measures. This indicates that at least the growth rate of emissions \nis expected decrease. \n \n \n\nFigure 8 Historical and projected developments in the transport sector by country 2018-2030 \n(absolute) \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n \n\n \nIf relative developments are considered, Portugal, Finland and Spain show highest projected decreases in \nscenarios with additional measures. On the other hand, Cyprus, Hungary and Romania not only show the \nhighest absolute but also show the highest relative projected emission increases with additional \nmeasures. \n                                                           \n(10)  Chapters 3.2 to 3.6 compare the reported effects of policies and measures with the projected greenhouse \n\ngas emissions.

It should be noted that the number of reported policies and measures varies among \nthe Member States and this may also have an impact on the number of reported objectives per PaM per \nMember State.  \nThe total effect on Effort Sharing emissions is presented as the sum of all quantified effects reported for \nplanned PaMs for the year 2030 (\u201cPaMs effect\u201d). It can be understood as the additional reduction in emissions \ndue to the planned PaMs in 2030. This number is put in relation to the total effect of planned PaMs according \nto the GHG projections for the WAM scenario compared to the WEM scenario. The grey bars show how much \nof the WAM emission reductions (WAM projections minus WEM projections) are explained by the effect of \nthe quantified planned PaMs. For some countries the quantified PaMs effect exactly matches the WAM effect \nof the projection\u2019s scenario (e.g. Greece), but in most countries there remains a gap. According to the Eionet \nReport (Dauwe et al. 2019) this is related to the incompleteness of the PaMs quantification but also to the \ndifferent approaches applied by Member State. Information on the PaMs effect is reported for less than 40 % \nof the total reported PaMs (existing and planned). To put the estimated PaMs effect in 2030 in relation with \nthe sectoral emissions, the share of the quantified PaMs effect in the total sectoral WEM emissions in 2030 is \nincluded. In some countries the planned PaMs are expected to contribute to reductions in the sectoral \nemissions of up to one quarter. \n \nWhen concluding on the following results, it is important to understand that: \n\n\u2022 the absolute number of PaMs reported for a sector does not indicate a Member States commitment to \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions, because there are different approaches how Member States report \ntheir PaMs depending on their national system. Some countries prefer to report fewer, more general and \ncomprehensive PaMs, whereas some countries report many very specific PaMs and \n\n\u2022 the PaMs reported with a quantified reduction effect may not be the PaMs that contribute the largest \nreduction effects to a sector in a Member State. It might well be that the PaM with the largest reduction \neffect has not been quantified. \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 20 \n\nTable 1 Overview of quantified planned PaMs in the transport sector \n\nMember State No of PaMs \n(quantified/ not \nquantified) \n\nPaMs objectives Total PaMs effect \n(reduction effect of \nall sectoral planned \nPaMs) in 2030 (ESR) \nkt CO2e \n\n% share of PaMs \neffect in the \nWEM/WAM \ndifference of the \ntransport sector  \n\n% share of PaMs \neffect in total \nsectoral WEM \nemissions in \n2030 \n\nPlanned PaM with highest effect \n\nCzechia 2/0 \nEfficiency improvements of vehicles, \n\nDemand management/reduction \n142 \n\n \n1 % Road toll \n\nEstonia 7/0 \nModal shift to public transport or nonmotorized transport; \nDemand management/reduction; \nImproved behaviour,  \nImproved transport infrastructure; \n\nLow carbon fuels/electric cars \n\n604 \n \n\n25 % Additional spatial and land-use \nmeasures for urban transport energy \nsavings to increase and improve the \nefficiency of the transport system \n\nFinland 4/0 \nLow carbon fuels/electric cars, \nEfficiency improvements of vehicles \nModal shift to public transport or nonmotorized transport;  \n\nDemand management/reduction \n\n713 \n \n\n28 % Promoting the use of biofuels in the \ntransport sector (additional measure) \n\nGermany 5/0 \nImproved behaviour;  \nImproved transport infrastructure \nEfficiency improvements of vehicles \n\nLow carbon fuels/electric cars \n\n11000 NA (DE reported \nWAM measures \nfrom 2017, but \nno WAM \nprojections in \n2019) \n\n7 % Continuing the CO2 regulations for \nnewly registered cars to 60g/vkm in \n2030 and include trucks \n\nGreece 2/0 \nLow carbon fuels/electric cars \nEfficiency improvements of vehicles \nModal shift to public transport or nonmotorized transport \n\nImproved transport infrastructure; \n\n1157 \n \n\n7 % Further biofuel use in transportation \n\nIreland 2/0 Low carbon fuels/electric cars 1257 \n \n\n9 % Directive 2009/28/EC \u2013 on the \npromotion of the use of energy from \nrenewable sources \u2013 Transport \ncomponent \n\n38%\n\n89%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\n84%\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 21 \n\nMember State No of PaMs \n(quantified/ not \nquantified) \n\nPaMs objectives Total PaMs effect \n(reduction effect of \nall sectoral planned \nPaMs) in 2030 (ESR) \nkt CO2e \n\n% share of PaMs \neffect in the \nWEM/WAM \ndifference of the \ntransport sector  \n\n% share of PaMs \neffect in total \nsectoral WEM \nemissions in \n2030 \n\nPlanned PaM with highest effect \n\nLithuania 4/2 \nImproved behaviour;  \nModal shift to public transport or nonmotorized transport \nOther transport \nImproved behaviour \n\nLow carbon fuels/electric cars \n\n1376 \n \n\n22 % Implementation of incentives for the \nuse of combined freight transport \n\nSpain 2/8 Demand management/reduction 44 \n \n\n0.05 % Introduction of advanced biofuels in \nmaritime transport \n\nSource: EEA (2019a)\n\n387%\n\n0.13%\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 22 \n\nAccording to this analysis, 7 % of the total WAM effect (difference of WEM and WAM scenario) of the EU \nGHG projections can be directly linked to quantified PaMs reported by Member States (excluding \nGermany because no WAM reported). Due to the limited information on the ex-ante quantification of \nPaMs, for the large part of the WAM effect in the transport sector it is not possible to link this effect to \nspecific policies and to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of PaMs.  \n \nHowever, from those quantified, the PaMs with the highest impact in the WAM scenario are quite \ndiverse and refer to the increase of biofuels, e.g.:  \n\n- Finland plans to set minimum biofuel shares to reach a share of 30 % biofuels in transport fuels \nin 2030,  \n\n- Greece wants to continue the obligation to blend diesel with biodiesel and extend the measure \nto other transport sectors.  \n\n- Estonia plans a very comprehensive PaM which includes several sub-measures, e.g. to develop \nlight traffic routes, promotion of car sharing, reduction of subsidies for parking space, etc. \n\n- In Czechia the extension of the road toll to trucks with more than 3.5 tons and the change of \nroad pricing for freight transport (inclusion of first- and second-class roads) is the planned and \nquantified measure that lead to the largest reduction in the WAM scenario.  \n\n- Spain reported effects for two single PaMs related to the introduction of biofuels, which make \nup for only very small portion of the total WAM effect.  \n \n\nHowever, there are some inconsistencies in the reported data. Germany reports WAM measures which \nseem to be related to the 2017 submission, because they do not provide a WAM projections scenario11. \nFor Lithuania the total PaMs effect is larger than the total effect of the WAM scenario for 2030. There is \nno information provided in the report. For Czechia both planned PaMs were quantified but they only \nexplain 38 % of the WAM effect, but there is no explanation for this provided in the report. \n \nIn the following, selected countries are analysed for their additional PaMs as they have reported the \nhighest relative emission reductions in the transport sector for their WAM scenario compared to the \nWEM in 2030 (see Figure 10). As not all Member States provide the ex-ante impacts for their PaMs, \nadditional information from their PaMs and projections reports were summarized in the following in \norder to help understanding the projected reductions in the WAM.  \n \nBelgium \n \nBelgium is responsible for 3 % of transport emissions in EU in the year 2018. It reports slightly increasing \ntransport emissions in the WEM scenario (+9 % between 2018 and 2030), but in the WAM scenario the \nemissions are projected to decrease by -24 % by 2030 due to the implementation of additional policies. \nIn 2030 the emissions in the WAM scenario are lower by 9 211 kt CO2e than in the WEM scenario. 23 \nadditional policies and measures have been reported, their specific effects have not been quantified.  \n \nAccording to the projections report12, the most determining factor driving the emissions in the transport \nsector is the share of biofuels in road transport, which is increased in the WAM scenario. Other \nadditional measures for the Flemish region aim to reduce the vehicle kilometres and the shift to electric \nor hybrid vehicles. The latter is also formulated in a strategic document that foresees a share of 50 % of \nzero emission vehicles sold as new cars in 2030. In this context Belgium also underlines the importance \nof kilometre charges for passenger cars. For Wallonia the share of electric vehicles will also be increased. \nFor the Brussels region the main additional measures are reduction of cars and the greening of the fleet. \n \n\n                                                           \n(11)  Note that in 2020 DE provided an update of its PaMs reporting, however for consistency reasons only the \n\nsubmissions of 2019 were considered. \n(12)  Belgium report on \u201eProjections of greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removal by sinks: Information \n\non the assumptions, parameters and methods - Reporting under Article 14 of Regulation (EU) n\u00b0 525/2013\u201d \n(2019) \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 23 \n\nFigure 11  Most common objectives of additional transport PaMs in Belgium  \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \nSpain \n \n11 % of EU emissions in the transport sector in 2018 are reported from Spain. There, emissions in the \ntransport sector are expected to increase in the WEM scenario by 4 % by 2030 compared to 2018. On the \nother hand, with additional measures the emissions are projected to decrease by -34 % by 2030. The \noverall effect of the WAM measures in 2030 amounts to a reduction of 33 779 kt CO2e compared to \nWEM. Spain reports two quantified PaMs which aim to increase biofuels in air and maritime transport \n(referring to the Renewable Energy Directive). The estimated effect of these measures in 2030 is \n44 kt CO2e, However, in the projections report13 a table with overall WAM effects for ESR emissions per \npolicy package is provided. For the planned aviation PaMs the reduction effect in 2030 compared to the \nWEM is estimated at \u2013 5 kt CO2e. The additional PaMs related to road transport are expected to reduce \nemissions by -34 142 kt CO2e in 2030. Planned PaMs for maritime transport result in a slight emission \nreduction of -38.5 kt CO2e, whereby in the railway sector emissions are expected to increase by \n436.5 kt CO2e due to additional PaMs in 2030. The main reduction is achieved in the road transport \nsector. These measures include the use of biofuel for road transport. Furthermore, Spain plans to reduce \nthe passenger km in urban areas by 35 % until 2030. The car fleet shall be renewed and replaced by \nelectric vehicles. This is projected to lead to cumulated savings in final energy consumption of 2 520 ktoe \nin the period 2021-2030 which corresponds to 18 % of the total final energy consumption in the \ntransport sector14.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(13)  Spain\u2019s GHG projections report: \u201cProyecciones de emisiones a la atm\u00f3sfera edici\u00f3n 2019 - Sumario de \n\nresultados\u201d \n(14)  PaMs database 2019 \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 24 \n\nFigure 12  Most common objectives of additional transport PaMs in Spain \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \nEstonia \n \nEstonia\u2019s transport emissions make up for 0.3 % of EU transport emissions in 2018. In the WEM scenario, \nEstonian emissions are projected to increase by 2 % between 2018 and 2030, whereby in the WAM \nscenario they are expected to decrease by -27 % due to additional measures. The emission reduction by \nthe seven reported additional measures in 2030 amounts to 681 kt CO2e and Estonia has quantified all \ntransport PaMs covering 89 % of this effect. In the report there is no explanation provided why the sum \nof all PaMs effects are not fully covering the WAM effect, however it is mentioned that a PaM on railway \nelectrification has not been quantified yet, because it is still under development. This PaM is also not \nreported in the PaMs database. The PaM on spatial planning and land use measures for urban transport \nleads to the highest emission savings in the WAM scenario. This measure includes the development of \ntraffic routes for \u201clight traffic\u201d, promotion of car sharing, updates in the urban parking systems and \nreduction of subsidies for parking spots and the reduction of the use of private cars15. Other additional \nmeasures reported by Estonia are the further development of public transport, support scheme for \nelectric cars, development of the rail infrastructure, further promotion of eco-driving, improved \nefficiency of tyres and aerodynamics of cars and road usage fees. In the WEM scenario the PaM aiming \nto increase the share in biofuels has the highest impact in 2030, but this PaM is not intensified in the \nWAM scenario.  \n \n\n                                                           \n(15)  Estonia\u2019s report on GHG projections Report pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 525/2013 \n\nsubmitted in 2019 \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 25 \n\nFigure 13  Most common objectives of additional transport PaMs in Estonia  \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n\n3.3 Buildings \n\nUnder the buildings category for this analysis we include the sectors 1.A.4 and 1.A.5, although we are \naware that there is a small portion of emissions from mobile sources included in both sectors. However, \nthe projections data set does not allow for a further disaggregation of the sectors 1.A.4 and 1.A.5, \ntherefore we use the sum of both sectors as \u201cbuilding sector\u201d. \n\n3.3.1 EU trends along the timeline \n\nMost emissions in the building sector stem from the combustion of fossil fuels for space heating. The \nlong-term trend of the EU buildings sector shows decreasing emissions, which is result of the \nimplementation of higher standards for new buildings but also due to measures to increase energy \nefficiency in existing buildings (e.g. through changing of heating systems, thermal insulation and more \nefficient heating systems). The latest data of the EU NIR (EEA 2020a) shows a strong decrease in \nemissions from liquid and solid fuels and an increase of gaseous fuels in the sector, which leads to overall \nlower emissions in the sector. But also, outdoor temperatures, the size of the total building stock and \nareas are important factors that influence the emission trend. In the latest EEA analysis on trends and \ndrivers of GHG emissions, it is noted that there is a trend of decreased heating demand due to warmer \ntemperatures (EEA 2019b). On the other hand, according to the decomposition analysis of the ODYSEEMURE database for space heating in households, the effect of technical energy savings has a large impact \non the reduction of fuel consumption in households, but at the same time the increased number of \ndwellings and larger floor areas of the buildings partly counterbalanced this effect (Odyssee-Mure 2020). \nAccording to the EEA indicators, the consumption of energy for space heating per sqm has decreased by \napproximately 25 % in 2016 compared to 1990, whereby the floor area has increased by 25 % in the \nsame time period (EEA 2019c). \n \nCurrent projections show that that the historical trend in reducing emissions is expected to continue. \nWith existing measures, emissions will further decrease by 13 % by 2030 compared to 2018. With \nadditional measures, emission reductions will amount to -21 % by 2030 compared 2018 (see Figure 6 and \nFigure 14). \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 26 \n\nIt should be noted that any changes in the buildings sector, might reduce emissions from this sector, but \nlikely causes a shift of emissions to other sectors, which could be covered in the ETS. In case of the \nexchange of the heating system by district heating emissions in the buildings sector are reduced, but this \nwill increase emissions e.g. in the energy supply sector (1.A.1) in which the energy is produced instead. \nSimilarly, the direct or indirect use of electricity in the building sector increases emissions in the energy \nsector. As far as the additional demand in the energy sector is not covered by renewable energies, this \nleads to higher emissions in this sector, which is largely covered under the EU ETS. \n \n \n\nFigure 14  Historical and projected developments in the building sector for EU-27 1990-2030 \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\n3.3.2 Projection of progress by Member States \n\nAt EU level, emissions in the buildings sector decreased by 25 % between 2005 and 2018. In only four \nMember States (Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Malta) emissions increased in this time period \nwhereas in all other Member States emission decreases have been reported.  \n \nIn projections with existing policies and measures, eight Member States projected increasing emissions \n(Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Romania, Slovakia and Spain). However, even with additional \npolicies and measures there remain only three Member States (Cyprus, Greece and Romania) which \nreport increasing emissions in their projections (see Figure 15) although they have reported decreasing \nemissions in the past.  \n \nThe highest absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions in the buildings sector have been projected in \nFrance, Germany and Italy (see Figure 15). These emissions reductions are between 35 and 22 Mt CO2e. \nIn Germany, the historical emission reductions between 2005 and 2018 were about the same level as \nwhat is projected with existing measures for 2018-2030.

This is especially the case for Slovenia, Sweden and Greece, where the reduction from 2005 to 2018 is \nlower than -100 %, outside of the range of the figure.  \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 17  Difference between WEM and WAM projections in the buildings sector by country \n\n  \nNote: To make the GHG developments comparable between Member States, reductions in the right figure have been divided by \nsectoral ESD emissions 2018 of the respective Member States. \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \nInsights about effects of policies and measures in WAM scenarios are presented in section 3.3.3., with a \nspecial focus on those Member States which project highest effects in their scenarios with additional \npolicies and measures (Belgium, Spain and Hungary).  \n\n-100%\n\n-75%\n\n-50%\n\n-25%\n\n0%\n\n25%\n\n50%\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\nB\n\nul\nga\n\nri\na\n\nLi\nth\n\nu\nan\n\nia\nB\n\nel\ngi\n\num\nIr\n\nel\nan\n\nd\nFi\n\nnl\nan\n\nd\nG\n\ner\nm\n\nan\ny\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\nIt\n\nal\ny\n\nN\net\n\nh\ner\n\nla\nn\n\nd\ns\n\nH\nu\n\nn\nga\n\nry\nD\n\nen\nm\n\nar\nk\n\nC\nze\n\nch\nia\n\nSp\nai\n\nn\nSl\n\nov\nen\n\nia\nA\n\nu\nst\n\nri\na\n\nC\nro\n\nat\nia\n\nPo\nrt\n\nug\nal\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\nEs\n\nto\nni\n\na\nLu\n\nxe\nm\n\nbo\nur\n\ng\nP\n\no\nla\n\nn\nd\n\nSl\nov\n\nak\nia\n\nR\no\n\nm\nan\n\nia\nU\n\nn\nit\n\ned\n K\n\nin\ngd\n\nom\nG\n\nre\nec\n\ne\nC\n\nyp\nru\n\ns\nM\n\nal\ntaR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nch\n\nan\nge\n\ns \n[%\n\n o\nf \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n8\n\n]\n\nWEM (2018-2030) WAM (2018-2030) Historic (2005-2018)\n\n-111%-104% -174%\n\n-20,0\n\n-18,0\n\n-16,0\n\n-14,0\n\n-12,0\n\n-10,0\n\n-8,0\n\n-6,0\n\n-4,0\n\n-2,0\n\n0,0\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nIt\nal\n\ny\n\nSp\nai\n\nn\n\nB\nel\n\ngi\nu\n\nm\n\nH\nun\n\nga\nry\n\nIr\nel\n\nan\nd\n\nG\nre\n\nec\ne\n\nR\nom\n\nan\nia\n\nSl\nov\n\nak\nia\n\nFi\nnl\n\nan\nd\n\nC\nro\n\nat\nia\n\nU\nn\n\nit\ned\n\n K\nin\n\ngd\no\n\nm\n\nPo\nrt\n\nug\nal\n\nEs\nto\n\nni\na\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nA\nd\n\nd\nit\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n r\n\ned\nu\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n b\n\net\nw\n\nee\nn\n\n W\nEM\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n W\n\nA\nM\n\n i\nn\n\n 2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n \n[M\n\nt \nC\n\nO\n2\n\n] \neq\n\n]\n\nBuldings (absolute)\n\nDifference WEM/WAM\n\n-30%\n\n-25%\n\n-20%\n\n-15%\n\n-10%\n\n-5%\n\n0%\n\nB\nel\n\ngi\nu\n\nm\n\nSp\nai\n\nn\n\nH\nun\n\nga\nry\n\nFr\nan\n\nce\n\nG\nre\n\nec\ne\n\nIt\nal\n\ny\n\nEs\nto\n\nni\na\n\nIr\nel\n\nan\nd\n\nSl\nov\n\nak\nia\n\nFi\nnl\n\nan\nd\n\nC\nro\n\nat\nia\n\nR\no\n\nm\nan\n\nia\n\nPo\nrt\n\nug\nal\n\nLa\ntv\n\nia\n\nU\nn\n\nit\ned\n\n K\nin\n\ngd\no\n\nm\n\nA\nd\n\nd\nit\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n r\n\ned\nu\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n b\n\net\nw\n\nee\nn\n\n W\nEM\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n W\n\nA\nM\n\n i\nn\n\n 2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n [\n%\n\n]\n\nBuildings (percentage points)\n\nDifference WEM/WAM\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 29 \n\n3.3.3 Reported planned PaM of Member States \n\nThe analysis of PaMs is more challenging for the building sector compared to other sectors.16 The effects \nof PaMs are often interlinked or overlapping with other sector\u2019s PaMs and emission reduction efforts can \nbe counterbalanced by rebound effects. This is also a challenge for modelling and quantifying the impact \nof the PaMs and therefore only a small share of planned measures is quantified. In 2019, the countries \nreported 74 planned measures related to the building sector, which were selected because the \ndescription or the objectives related to the building sector. Only 21 PaMs were quantified by six Member \nStates (Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland and Slovakia). \n\n                                                           \n(16)  For a description of the methodological approach used see chapter 3.2.3. \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 30 \n\nTable 2 Overview of quantified planned PaMs in the buildings sector \n\nMember State No of PaMs \n(quantified/ \nnot \nquantified) \n\nPaMs objectives Total PaMs \neffect \n(reduction \neffect of all \nsectoral PaMs) \nin 2030 (ESR) kt \nCO2e  \n\n% share of PaMs \neffect in the \nWEM/WAM \ndifference of the \nbuilding sector  \n\n% share of \nPaMs effect \nin total \nsectoral \nWEM \nemissions in \n2030 \n\nPlanned PaM with highest effect \n\nGermany 04/05 \nEfficiency improvements of buildings \nOther energy consumption \nIncrease in renewable energy \nEfficiency improvement of appliances \nEfficiency improvement in industrial end-use \nsectors \n\nEfficiency improvement in services/ tertiary \nsector \n\n7900 NA (DE reported \nWAM measures from \n2017, but no WAM \nprojections in 2019) \n\n9 % \n\n \nProlongation and further development of \ngrants for efficient heat pumps and solar \nheating installations through the Market \nIncentive Programme for Renewable \nEnergies (MAP) \n\nEstonia 03/03 \nEfficiency improvements of buildings; \nEfficiency improvement in services/ tertiary \nsector; \n\nDemand management/reduction \n\n79 \n \n\n11 %  Additional reconstruction of private houses \nand apartment buildings \n\nFinland 01/01 \nDemand management/reduction \n\n407 \n \n\n11 % Promoting the use of bioliquids in heating \nof buildings \n\nGreece 01/01 \nEfficiency improvements of buildings;  \nEfficiency improvement in services/ tertiary \nsector \n\nEfficiency improvement of appliances \n\n1012 \n \n\n12 % Further promotion of natural gas in \nresidential and tertiary sectors and \nimplementation of additional energy \nefficiency measures in Residential and \nTertiary Sector (National Energy Efficiency \nAction Plan) \n\nIreland 11/13 \nEfficiency improvements of buildings \nEfficiency improvement in services/ tertiary \nsector; \nEfficiency improvement in industrial end-use \nsectors \nIncrease in renewable energy \nDemand management/reduction \n\n893 \n \n\n12 % Better Energy Homes (With Additional \nMeasures) \n\nSource:  .

Most countries report key planned PaMs that focus on efficiency measures, e.g.  \n\n- Estonia which plans the reconstruction of 20 % of existing public and commercial buildings by \n2030.  \n\n- Finland and Greece have their focus rather on fuel switch.  \n- In Finland the share of bioliquids for heating shall be increased to 10 % by 2030.  \n- The main measure in Greece has multiple objectives, namely to create tax incentives for \n\nrenewable energy facilities (for heating and cooling) in the residential and tertiary sector; to \nimplement financing programs for the renovation of public and private tertiary sector buildings \nunder the new programming period after 2020; to set up regulatory measures to promote \nbuildings of nearly zero energy; and to promote Energy Efficiency Agreements in the private \nsector through targeted financial programs.  \n\n- The planned measure of Ireland with the highest effect provides grant-aids to householders who \nwant to make their homes more energy-efficient by providing incentives towards the \nimplementation of energy efficiency measures including attic and wall insulation and heating \ncontrols with efficient boilers and/or solar thermal.  \n\n- The Slovakian planned PaM aims to supporting faster renovation of old buildings, including \ninsulation and strict building codes for new constructions. \n\n \nAs for the transport sector also for the building sector some inconsistencies occur in the dataset. \nGermany reports WAM measures which seem to be related to the 2017 submission, because they do not \nprovide a WAM projections scenario. For Estonia, Finland and Ireland the PaMs effect is not fully \nmatching with the total WAM effect. However, there is no information provided in the reports on any \nreasons for this. For Slovakia the effect is more than 100 % of the sectoral WAM effect, as according to \nthe PaMs description other sectors (Industry and transport) are also covered by this measure. For \nLithuania the total PaMs effect is larger than the total effect of the WAM scenario for 2030. There is no \ninformation provided in the report, but it could be that the figures reported for the planned PaMs in the \nPaMs database are the cumulated effects from 2021-2030 and not the annual effect for 2030. For \nCzechia both planned PaMs were quantified but they only explain 38 % of the WAM effect, but there is \nno explanation for this provided in the report. \n \nThe following, selected countries are analysed for their additional PaMs as they have reported the \nhighest relative emission reductions for their WAM scenario compared to the WEM (see Figure 17). \n \nBelgium \n \nBelgium\u2019s emissions from the building sector make up for 5 % in the EU-27 emissions in 2018. In the \nWEM scenario the emissions are projected to decrease by -1 % by 2030 compared to 2018. In the WAM \nscenario the emission reduction is expected to be -29 % in the same time period. Belgium reports about \n21 planned PaMs which can be attributed to the building sector for the three regions. None of these \nmeasures is quantified. According to the report for the Flemish region, the Flemish renovation pact \nprovides the main target of reducing the energy demand of residential buildings by 76 % in 2050 \ncompared to 2012. This is translated into different measures with a strong focus on the decarbonisation \nand increased efficiency of heating systems. For Wallonia the additional measures aim at building \nrenovation, improve energy consumption of new buildings and the use of renewable energy sources for \nheating. For Brussels capital region the planned measures include the exchange of fossil fuel-based \nheating systems and the renovation of buildings. There is no information provided which PaMs have the \nhighest impact on emission reduction. \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 32 \n\nFigure 18  Most common objectives of additional building PaMs in Belgium  \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \nSpain \n \nEmissions in the building sector are expected to decrease by 1 % by 2030 in the WEM and by 20 % by \n2030 in the WAM scenario compared to 2018. The whole sector contributes with 5 % to the EU-27 \nemissions. Spain reports nine planned PaMs which can be associated with the buildings sector and are \nnot quantified. They include the promotion of renewable gases and biomass use to replace fossil fuels, \nbut also building renovation (about 1.2 million buildings shall be thermally renovated until 2030). The \nrenovation rate shall be gradually increased from 2021 to 2030, starting with 30 000 homes per year in \n2021 and ending with 300 000 homes in 2030. Through setting up a guarantee of origin scheme, support \nprogrammes and the revision of the building code, the renewable energy share in the heating and \ncooling sector shall be improved. Additional measures also aim at improving large air-condition \ninstallations and renovation of refrigeration equipment in the public sector, as well as the promotion of \nself-consumption. In the projections report, it is stated that the planned PaMs of the policy package for \nthe residential sector contribute to an additional emission reduction of 5 347 kt CO2e in 2030 compared \nto the WEM scenario (Spanish Projections report 2019, see footnote 9). \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 33 \n\nFigure 19  Most common objectives of additional building PaMs in Spain \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \nHungary \n \nHungary\u2019s emissions from the building sector make up for 2.5 % of the EU-27emissions in this sector in \n2018. In the WEM scenario emissions are projected to decrease by -4 % in 2030 compared to 2018, in \nthe WAM scenario emissions are expected to decrease by 25 % in the same time period. Hungary reports \nfive planned measures which are attributed to the building sector. Estimated impacts on GHG emissions \nare not provided. There is no information on PaMs in the report and the information in the database is \nrather limited. For two measures related to the accelerated exchange of the existing building stock and \nto the promotion of heat pumps, energy saving objectives are provided in the PaMs database (429 ktoe \nand 38 ktoe, respectively), but without mentioning a time horizon until when these savings shall be \nachieved. The other PaMs focus on the promotion of exchange of heating systems, use of modern \nbiomass-based fuels. The budget for energy efficiency programmes for buildings is planned to be \nincreased and the resources shall be allocated towards climate related measures and another PaM is \nfocusing on grants and credits for in the framework of the energy efficiency programme for buildings.  \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 34 \n\nFigure 20  Most common objectives of additional building PaMs in Hungary  \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \n\n3.4 Agriculture \n\n3.4.1 EU trends along the timeline \n\nAbout 39 % of the European Union\u2019s land is farmland (Cook 2019). Since 1957 agriculture in Europe is \ndetermined by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union. Initially the CAP was mainly \naiming on higher agricultural productivity. With the MacSharry reform of 1992 the EU took steps to shift \nCAP subsidies away from price and market support towards direct support for farmers. This was \ncontinuously pursued with the Agenda 2000 reform, focusing more on the maintenance and \nenhancement of the rural environment and a better recognition of agriculture as a multifunctional \nactivity. The 2003 CAP reform focused on making the European agriculture more market oriented and at \nthe same time targeted on environmental protection (EEA 2020a).  \n \nWith 17 % of total Effort Sharing emissions at EU level, agriculture is the third largest source of emissions \nin the Effort Sharing sectors. Agricultural emissions in EU decreased by 21 % between 1990 and 2018. \nThis reduction was mainly driven by the two largest emission sectors in agriculture. Emissions from \nenteric fermentation from cattle decreased due to a reduction in cattle population in Europe and direct \nN2O emissions from agricultural soils decreased due to less quantities of applied fertilizer (EEA 2020a). \nWith emission trends in this sector nearly constant between 2005 and 2018, this sector has hardly \ncontributed to reductions in the Effort Sharing sectors during that time.  \n  \nCurrent projections show that that the latest historical trend is likely to continue as countries plan rather \nlow emission reductions in this sector. Even with additional measures emissions in this sector will reach \nno further than 25 % below 1990 level by 2030, predicting a reduction of only 4 % in the period 2018 \u2013 \n2030 (see Figure 21). \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 35 \n\nFigure 21  Historical and projected developments in the agriculture sector for EU-27 1990-2030 \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\n3.4.2 Projection of progress by Member States \n\nCurrent projections indicate that countries plan rather low emission reductions in this sector.  \nWith existing policies and measures emissions will only be reduced by another 2 % in 2030 in relation to \n2018. With additional policies and measures, emissions will reach 25 % below 1990 level.  \nIn projections with existing policies and measures, fourteen Member States projected slightly increasing \nemissions (Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the \nNetherlands, Romania, Slovenia and Spain). However, even with additional policies and measures all but \none of these Member States (Croatia) still report increasing emissions in their projections (see Figure 22). \nThe highest absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions in the agriculture sector have been projected \nin Spain, France and the UK (see Figure 22). These emissions reductions are between 10 and 3 Mt CO2e.  \n \nRegarding the relative changes, Spain, Portugal and Belgium show highest projected decreases in their \nscenarios.

These measures most commonly \naim at improving cropland management, reducing fertilizer use and manure application on cropland \nimproving livestock management.  \n  \nPaMs reported are mostly related to the implementation of European policies such as the Common \nAgricultural Policy, the Nitrates Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive. \nAgain, it should be noted that additional PaMs reported by Germany are related to its previous \nsubmission from 2017 and no WAM projections were reported in 2019.

This PaM is followed by the impact of another set of \nmeasures focusing on the promotion of the rotations of dry arable crops and the adjustment of \nnitrogen supply to the needs of the crop. \n\n  \nAs for other sectors there are some inconsistences in the dataset. Germany, like for all other sectors, \nreports WAM measures which seem to be related to the 2017 submission, because they do not provide a \nWAM projections scenario. For Lithuania the total PaMs effect is larger than the total effect of the WAM \nscenario for 2030. There is no information provided in the report on this, but possibly figures reported \nfor the planned PaMs in the PaMs database represent the cumulated effects from 2021-2030 and not \nthe annual effect for 2030 (see also explanation in Transport chapter). Also, Spain\u2019s WAM effect in the \nagriculture sector is slightly above 100 %, with no explanation given in their report. For Finland and \nIreland, the quantification of the planned PaMs explains about 90 % respectively 98 % of the WAM \neffect. \n \nThe following, selected countries are analysed for their additional PaMs as they have reported the \nhighest emission reductions for their WAM scenario compared to the WEM (see Figure 24) \n \nCroatia \n \nIn 2018 0.7 % of EU emissions in the agriculture sector are reported from Croatia. In the WEM scenario \nthe emissions are reported to increase by 7 % by 2030 compared to 2018. In the WAM scenario the \nemissions are expected to decrease again and reach a level of -5 % during the same period. Croatia \nreports 9 planned PaMs associated with the Agriculture sector but none of them is quantified. Six of \nthese additional PaMs are linked to the CAP reform, two to the Nitrate Directive and one to the RES \nDirective. Four of these PaMs are mainly aiming at the reduction of fertilizer/manure use on cropland, \ntwo on improving of animal waste management systems, one on the improvement of livestock \nmanagement and one on the improvement of organic soils. The remaining PaM is planned to facilitate \nthe development of a biomass market for Croatian small-scale farms. \n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 40 \n\nFigure 25  Most common objectives of additional agriculture PaMs in Croatia  \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \nSpain \n \n10 % of EU-27 emissions in the agriculture sector in 2018 are reported from Spain. In the WEM scenario \nthe emissions are reported to decrease by 13 % by 2030 compared to 2018, in the WAM by 24 %. Spain \nreports 2 planned PaMs in the Agriculture sector. These two PaMs include a wide range of measures. \nThese two PaMs include a wide range of measures. Their estimated impact on GHG emissions is shown in \nTable 3. One of these PaMs is supporting the improvement of animal waste management systems such \nas the covering of slurry rafts and the separation of solid and liquid slurry during its management.

Estimated \nimpacts on GHG emissions are not provided. \n \n\nThese additional reported agricultural PaMs cover a wide set of objectives. These include two PaMs \n\nexplicitly promoting organic farming and the use of organic products in restaurants. One PaM is \n\nfacilitating the use of renewable energy on agricultural holdings while another PaM aims at the decline \n\nof urbanization and the limitation of the artificiality of land.  \n\n \n\nThe majority of PaMs is focusing on the reduction of fertilizer/manure use, the improvement of grazing \n\nland or grassland management and on improving animal waste management systems. \n\n \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 42 \n\nFigure 27  Most common objectives of additional agriculture PaMs in France  \n\n \nNote:  The size of each rectangle and the number indicates how many times the objective was mentioned \nSource:  ETC/CME, EEA (2019a). \n\n \n \n\n3.5 Waste \n\nSolid waste disposal and wastewater treatment are the main contributors to emissions in this sector. \nLandfills generate methane emissions if the dumped waste with carbon content (e.g. food waste, wood, \nplastics) decompose under anaerobic conditions. The same can occur in wastewater containing human \neffluent. Biological treatment of solid waste and waste incineration do not play a significant role. In total, \nthe waste sector only contributes by 3.1 % of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\n3.5.1 EU trends along the timeline \n\nCompared to 1990, emission in the sector decreased by 36 % until 2019, faster than total GHG emissions \n(26 %). Emissions from solid waste disposal sites are controlled by the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC). It \nrequires that the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfills by 2016 is no more than 35 % of the \nrespective value in 199518. Instead, biodegradable waste needs to be composted, recycled or sent to \nwaste incineration facilities. The impact on methane emission from landfills from the Directive is \ndelayed, the degradation process depends on the local climate and can take up to 20 years. For this \nreason, emissions are not declining a quickly as the quantity of biodegradable waste being sent to \nlandfills. In addition, the Landfill Directive requires the capture and treatment of landfill gas from solid \nwaste disposal sites. Landfill gas capture might not be feasible for all sites and cannot capture all \nemissions. \n \nMember States expect a continued decrease of emissions from waste until 2030 with little difference \nbetween the WEM and the WAM scenario. With the continued degradation of waste in the remaining \nlandfills emissions will continue to decline in the future. \n \n\n                                                           \n(18)  For some Member States the deadline is 2020 instead of 2016. \n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 43 \n\nFigure 28  Historical and projected developments in the waste sector for EU-27 1990-2030 \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\n3.5.2 Projection of progress by Member States \n\nExcept for Croatia and Malta, all Member States expect a continued decrease of emissions from waste in \nthe WEM scenario. In the WAM scenario, only Malta projects an emission increase compared to 2018. \nOnly few Member States show higher reductions in the WAM scenario, most notably Croatia which \nintends to decrease emissions by over 20 % in 2030 compared to 2018; in the WEM scenario, emissions \nare projected to be over 40 % above current levels. In absolute terms, the difference between the WEM \nand WAM scenario for the EU-27 is less than 10 Mt CO2e. \n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030\n\nEf\nfo\n\nrt\n S\n\nh\na\n\nri\nn\n\ng \nem\n\nis\nsi\n\no\nn\n\ns \n[M\n\nt C\nO\n\n2\n e\n\nq\n]\n\nWaste\n\nWAM WEM Historic\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 44 \n\nFigure 29 Historical and projected developments in the waste sector by country 2018-2030 \n(absolute) \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure 30 Historical and projected developments in the waste sector by country 2018-2030 \n(percentage points) \n\n \nNote: To make the GHG developments comparable between Member States, emissions in this figure have been divided by \nsectoral ESD emissions 2018 of the respective Member States.  \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nA\nb\n\nso\nlu\n\nte\n c\n\nh\na\n\nn\nge\n\ns \n[M\n\nt \nC\n\nO\n2\n\n e\nq\n\n]\n\nWEM (2018-2030) WAM (2018-2030) Historic (2005-2018)\n\n-60%\n\n-40%\n\n-20%\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\nB\nel\n\ngi\num\n\nIr\nel\n\nan\nd\n\nC\nyp\n\nru\ns\n\nN\net\n\nhe\nrl\n\nan\nd\n\ns\nLi\n\nth\nu\n\nan\nia\n\nG\ner\n\nm\nan\n\ny\nLa\n\ntv\nia\n\nSw\ned\n\nen\nSl\n\nov\nak\n\nia\nFi\n\nnl\nan\n\nd\nFr\n\nan\nce\n\nA\nu\n\nst\nri\n\na\nU\n\nn\nit\n\ned\n K\n\nin\ngd\n\nom\nEs\n\nto\nn\n\nia\nC\n\nze\nch\n\nia\nIt\n\nal\ny\n\nSp\nai\n\nn\nPo\n\nrt\nug\n\nal\nR\n\nom\nan\n\nia\nH\n\nu\nn\n\nga\nry\n\nC\nro\n\nat\nia\n\nD\nen\n\nm\nar\n\nk\nLu\n\nxe\nm\n\nbo\nur\n\ng\nSl\n\nov\nen\n\nia\nPo\n\nla\nnd\n\nG\nre\n\nec\ne\n\nB\nul\n\nga\nri\n\na\nM\n\nal\nta\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nch\n\nan\nge\n\ns \n[%\n\n o\nf \n\n20\n18\n\n]\n\nWEM (2018-2030) WAM (2018-2030) Historic (2005-2018)\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 45 \n\nFigure 31  Difference between WEM and WAM projections in the waste sector by Member State \n\n   \nNote: To make the GHG developments comparable between Member States, reductions in the right figure have been divided by \nsectoral ESD emissions 2018 of the respective Member States. \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\n3.6 Small industry \n\nThe sector \u201cSmall industry\u201d aggregates sectors which although mainly covered by the EU ETS contain \nemissions from smaller energy and industrial activities, which are not covered under the EU ETS. These \nsectors are Energy Industries (1A1, 1B and 1C), Manufacturing and Construction (1A2) and Industrial \nprocesses (2). ESD emissions of these sectors can be seen as the residual emissions between total ESD \nemissions and ESD emissions of the other sectors, mentioned before. \n\n3.6.1 EU trends along the timeline \n\nAt the level of total EU emissions, ETS emissions are decreasing at a rate which is considerably higher \nthan emissions covered under the ESD. While ETS emissions decreased by 43 % between 1990 and 2019, \nreductions of ESD emissions have been reduced by 14 %, less than a third. Projections show future \ndecreases, but at a slower rate. The reduction rate of ESD emissions of \u201cSmall industry\u201d is more than \ntwice as high than the average ESD reduction between 1990 and 2019, with a lower rate since 2005. \n \nFor the group of sectors covered under \u201cSmall industry\u201d, the rates of ESD reductions are heterogeneous \n(see also (ETC/ACM 2018a)). Between 2005 and 2019 a small increase of ESD emissions from energy \nindustries is visible, while emissions decreased by 19 % in both other sectors (1.A.2 and 2). Increasing \nESD emissions of energy industries can be explained by higher decentralized energy system structures \nwhich include a higher share of smaller energy stations below the ETS threshold of 20 MW. ESD emission \ndevelopments in sector 2 are often driven by F-gases. While there are no specific policies and measures \nreported which are targeting ESD emissions of energy industries, manufacturing and construction or \nprocess emissions, there are many policies and measures reported to reduce F-Gases.  \n \n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nA\nd\n\nd\nit\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n r\n\ned\nu\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n b\n\net\nw\n\nee\nn\n\n W\nEM\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n W\n\nA\nM\n\n i\nn\n\n 2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n \n[M\n\nt \nC\n\nO\n2\n\n] \neq\n\n]\n\nWaste (absolute)\n\nDifference WEM/WAM\n\n-70%\n\n-60%\n\n-50%\n\n-40%\n\n-30%\n\n-20%\n\n-10%\n\n0%\n\nA\ndd\n\nit\nio\n\nna\nl \n\nre\nd\n\nuc\nti\n\non\n b\n\net\nw\n\nee\nn \n\nW\nEM\n\n a\nnd\n\n W\nA\n\nM\n i\n\nn \n20\n\n30\n [\n\n%\n]\n\nWaste (percentage points)\n\nDifference WEM/WAM\n\f\n \n \n\n \nEionet Report - ETC/CME 8/2020 46 \n\nFigure 32  Historical and projected developments in the agriculture sector for EU-27 1990-2030 \n\n \nSource:  ETC/CME, Projections: EEA (2019d), Inventory data: EEA (2020c), ETS data: EEA (2020i). \n\n \n \n\n3.6.2 Projection of progress by Member States \n\nDevelopment on Member State level is very divers and often driven by the development of F-Gases. This \nhas been discussed in detail in (ETC/ACM 2018b). Highest relative historic reductions in this sector are \nseen by Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands, with highest increases in Malta and Lithuania, (see Figure \n33, right and compare to (ETC/ACM 2018b). Emissions in this sector have been increasing between 2005 \nand 2018 in many countries. Nevertheless, emission reductions are projected for all but four Member \nStates (Czechia, Romania, Denmark and Lithuania) until 2030 (see Figure 34).

This overshoot was propelled by steep emission cuts in 2019 and 2020.

EU greenhouse gas emissions are expected to further decline until 2030.

With one exception in 2017, the EU\u2019s GHG emissions were below the 2020 reduction target for the past 7 years, with the rapid decline in emissions observed in the last 2 years contributing significantly to this overshoot. These achievements include emissions from international aviation and do not account for land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) contributions.\nThe emissions decrease in 2020 compared with the previous year was 10% \u2014 making it the second year in a row with the steepest annual reduction seen in the last decade. The remarkable reduction of 4% achieved in 2019 was strongly driven by policy measures such as the substitution of coal by gas and renewable energy sources for power generation. The circumstances in 2020 were much different from 2019 and decreasing emissions caused by reduced energy use from economic activities and transport were largely related to the effects of the measures addressing the Covid-19 pandemic. The extent to which climate change mitigation measures also contributed to the decline in 2020 is currently unclear.\nLooking towards climate mitigation targets for 2030, the EU\u2019s total GHG emissions[1] are expected to continue declining to a net emissions reduction of 41%. Most Member States have not yet realigned their ambitions to the new net 55% reduction target for 2030, and the further introduction of more impactful policies and measures across Europe will be necessary to bring the new 2030 target within reach.\nThe EU\u2019s aim to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 will require a realistic and resilient emissions pathway into the future. The agreement and subsequent implementation of the EU policy proposals addressing the EU's ambitious 2030 and 2050 targets (compared with 1990 and including removals) is therefore fundamental to keep bending the emission trend while recovering from the pandemic.\n[1] Greenhouse gas projections submitted by Germany are preliminary.\nThree key EU policies address GHG emissions and removals: the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS); the Effort Sharing legislation; and the legislation on emissions and removals from LULUCF.\nThe ETS covers large power stations, large industrial plants, large district heating plants and aviation, representing about 40% of total EU emissions. Emissions have decreased by 41% since 2005, driven by the decarbonisation of the EU power sector.

The national targets cover sectors such as transport, buildings, non-ETS industry, agriculture and waste.
