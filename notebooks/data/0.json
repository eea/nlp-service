The report is based on data \nreported by EU Member States (EU\u201128) and Iceland to \nthe European Environment Agency (EEA) and verified \nby\u00a0manufacturers\t(OEMs).\t\n\nFor passenger cars, Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 \n(EU,\u00a02009)\tsets\tan\tEU\tfleet\twide\tCO2 target of 130 gCO2 \nper kilometre (gCO2 /km) for the period 2015 to 2019.\n\nFor light commercial vehicles, Regulation (EU) \nNo\u00a0510/2011\t(EU,\t2011)\tsets\tan\tEU\tfleet\twide\tCO2 target \nof\u00a0175\tgCO2/km for the period 2017 to 2019. \n\nStarting from 2012 for cars and 2014 for vans, \na\u00a0binding\tspecific\temission\ttarget\thas\tapplied\tannually\t\nfor each manufacturer. The target is set according \nto the average mass of the manufacturer's newly \nregistered vehicles using a limit value curve. For \neach manufacturer, the average specific emissions \nof its fleet of newly registered vehicles in the EU that \nyear, are compared with the manufacturer's specific \nemission\u00a0target.\n\nStricter targets apply from 2020, as set out in the \nnew Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission \nperformance standards for new passenger cars and \nfor new light commercial vehicles, and repealing \nRegulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 \nfrom 1 January 2020. \n\nAverage CO2 emissions from new cars \nincreased\tby\tmore\tthan\t2\tg\u00a0CO2/km in 2018 \n\nCars\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the average CO2 \nemissions\u00a0(1) from new passenger cars increased \nin 2018 and reached 120.8 gCO2/km. After a steady \ndecline from 2010 to 2016 by almost 22 gCO2/km, \n\naverage emissions increased in 2017 by  \n0.4\u00a0gCO2/km. The upward trend continued with an \nadditional increase of 2.3 gCO2 /km in 2018. \n\nThe main factors contributing to that increase include \nthe growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, \nin particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. \nMoreover, the market penetration of zero\u2011 and \nlow\u2011emission vehicles, including electric cars, remained \nlow in 2018.\n\nVans\n\nFor the first time in 2018, average CO2\temissions\u00a0from\t\nnew\tlight\tcommercial\tvehicles\tregistered\tin\tthe\u00a0EU\u00a0were\t\nhigher\tthan\tin\tthe\tprevious\tyear:\t157.9\u00a0gCO2/km \nin\t2018\tagainst\t156.1\u00a0gCO2/km in 2017. Whereas \nbetween 2012\u20112017 average CO2 emissions decreased \nby\t24\u00a0gCO2/km, in 2018 emissions have increased by \nalmost\t2\u00a0gCO2/km compared to 2017.

The \nmarket share of petrol vehicles remains limited but \nhas\tincreased\tslightly,\tconstituting\t3.6\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tnew\t\nvans\tfleet\t(2.4%\tin\t2017).\tThe\tshare\tof\tzero-\tand\t\nlow-emission\tvans\tremained\tat\tthe\tsame\tlevel\t(1.7\u00a0%)\t\nas in 2017.\n\nThe vast majority of new registrations \nin\u00a02018\twere\tfor\tpetrol\tcars\t\n\nPetrol cars constituted the vast majority of new \nregistrations\t(around\t60\u00a0%),\twhile\tdiesel\tcars\taccounted\t\nfor\tmore\tthan\t36\t%,\tmarking\ta\tdrop\tof\t9\tpercentage\t\npoints from 2017, and 19 percentage points from the \npeak\tyear\t2011\t(55%).\tTogether,\tconventional\tdiesel\t\nand\tpetrol\tcars\taccounted\tfor\t96.5\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tnew\t\nregistrations.\n\nExecutive summary\n\n(1) Average CO2 emissions are calculated as simple averages without taking into account any adjustments.\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n8 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nThe average fuel efficiency of both diesel and petrol \ncars has worsened in the last year: diesel cars emitted \non\taverage\t121.8\u00a0gCO2/km (117.9 gCO2/km in 2017), \nwhile the average petrol car emitted 123.5 gCO2/km \n(121.6 gCO2/km in 2017). In 2000 the emission difference \nbetween diesel and petrol cars was much larger \n(17.1\u00a0gCO2/km). \n\nRising sales of SUV\n\nAn increase in sales of Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) was \nobserved in recent years. In Europe, one out of three \ncars newly registered in 2018 were SUVs. Compared \nto regular cars (as hatchback or sedan), SUVs are \ntypically heavier and have more powerful engines \nand larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase \nfuel\u00a0consumption.\n\nAccording to the dataset, the majority of new SUVs sold \nwere\tpowered\tby\tpetrol\t(53%),\twith\taverage\temissions\t\nof\t133\u00a0gCO2/km,\twhich\tis\taround\t14\u00a0gCO2/km higher \nthan the average emissions of other new petrol cars. \nForty\u2011five percent of SUVS were diesel vehicles with \naverage emissions of 129 gCO2/km, which is around \n13\u00a0gCO2/km higher than the average emissions of other \nnew diesel car.\n\nLow market penetration of electric \nvehicles \n\nThe proportion of plug\u2011in hybrid and battery electric \ncars\tdoubled\tfrom\t1.0\t%\tin\t2016\tto\t2.0\u00a0%\tin\t2018.\t\n\nThe CO2 emissions savings related to the deployment \nof electric vehicles have increased over the years, \nand reached 2.0 gCO2/km in 2018. This concerns both \nbattery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug\u2011in hybrid electric \nvehicles (PHEV).\n\nOne car manufacturer exceeded its \nspecific emission targets\n\nThe majority of car manufacturers met their specific \nCO2 emission targets in 2018 (Annex 3). Certain \nmanufacturers would have exceeded their specific \nemission target, but they met the target as part of \npools or because of derogations (see Annex 1). One \nmanufacturer, Automobili Lamborghini SPA, exceeded \nits specific emission targets and therefore is required to \npay excess emission premiums.\n\nAll van manufacturers met their CO2 specific emission \ntargets in 2018, taking into account pools and \nderogations.\n\nMore efforts are needed in order for \nmanufacturers to respect the 2020 targets\n\nBecause of the increase of the emissions in the last \ntwo years, in 2018 most car manufacturers were still \nfar away from meeting their 2020/2021 targets. Toyota \nis\u00a0the\tclosest\tto\treaching\tits\tfuture\ttargets,\tbut\tstill\thad\t\nto reduce its average emissions by around 5 gCO2/km \nby 2020. \n\nFor all other manufacturers the distance to the future \ntargets is higher, up to 39 gCO2/km in the case of \nMazda Corporation.\n\nSome of vans' manufacturers have already achieved \naverage CO2 specific emissions below their 2020 target: \nAutomobile Peugeot, Automobile Citro\u00ebn, Ford\u2011Werke \nGmbH and Iveco. Manufacturers such as Nissan \nInternational, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Europe \nare already very close to their 2020 targets; they still \nneed to reduce their average emissions by less than \n4\u00a0gCO2/km in the next 2 years. Other manufacturers \nwill have to make further progress to achieve their \n2020\u00a0targets.\n\nReducing the gap between type-approval \nand real world emissions \n\nFor both passenger cars and vans, the reported CO2 \nemissions are based upon measurements performed \nin the laboratory using a standard vehicle test cycle. \nOver the past decade, the gap between the laboratory \nemissions based on the NEDC test cycle and the \nreal\u2011world emissions has grown. This has led to the \ndevelopment of a new measurement protocol, the \nWorldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure \n(WLTP), which is more representative of real\u2011\nworld\u00a0driving.\n\nSince 2018, countries have reported both \nCO2\u00a0emissions\tbased\ton\tthe\told\t(NEDC)\tand\tnew\ttest\t\nprocedure (WLTP), the latter only for the newer models. \nUntil 2020, compliance with the CO2 emission targets \nwill continue to be based on NEDC emission values. \nFrom 2021 onwards, the compliance will be based on \nWLTP values. \n\nFrom 1 January 2021 onward, new vehicles sold in \nthe EU will be equipped with standardised on\u2011board \nfuel and/or energy consumption monitoring devices, \nwhich will monitor real\u2011world data. These data \nwill allow monitoring and assessing the real\u2011world \nrepresentativeness of emissions determined through \nthe test procedure for type approval.\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n9Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nThe improvements in manufacturers \nperformance were mostly driven by \ndownsizing and electric vehicles\n\nSince 2010, the officially reported CO2 emissions \nof new passenger cars have reduced substantially. \nThese reductions can be attributed to both the overall \nimprovement of car energy efficiency as well as a \nchange in the mix of car models sold in favour of more \nefficient powertrains/technologies. \n\nHowever, the downward trend of average CO2 \nemissions stopped in 2016 and these emissions have \nbeen increasing in the last two years. These trends \nwere mainly affected by the following drivers:\n\n\u2022 engine downsizing;\n\n\u2022 de\u2011dieselization; (shift to petrol) \n\n\u2022 introduction of new models;\n\n\u2022 electrification of the fleet;\n\n\u2022 increase in the market share of SUVs.\n\nWhile engine downsizing and the uptake of electric \nvehicles always have a positive effect on reducing CO2 \nemissions, the increase of SUVs has systematically led \nto an increase of emissions.\n\nUpgrading models, in case of complete overhaul of \nmodel (both engine and bodywork improvements) may \nreduce emissions. The effect of the de\u2011dieselisation \nof the fleet on average CO2 emissions depends on the \nfleet characteristic of the manufacturer.\n\nFigure ES.1  Average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and vans in the EU-28 and Iceland\n\n90\n\n0\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n170\n\n190\n\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n\nPassenger cars Vans Targets - passenger cars Targets - vans\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n10 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure ES.2  Distance to 2018 target by cars pool\n\nNote:  Bubble size represents the number of registrations.\n\nAverage mass (kg)\n\n0\n\n160\n\nAverage emissions  (gCO2/km)\n\n105\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\n145\n\n150\n\n155\n\n1 0500 1 100 1 150 1 200 1 250 1 300 1 350 1 400 1 450 1 500 1 550 1 600 1 650 1 700 1 750 1 800 1 850 1 900 1 950 2 000 2 050\n\nLimit value curve 2018\n\nTATA MOTORS LTD, JAGUAR CARS LTD, LAND ROVER\n\nDAIMLER AG\n\nBMW GROUP\nFORD-WERKE GMBH\n\nVW GROUP PC\n\nMITSUBISHI MOTORS\n\nFCA ITALY SPA\n\nHYUNDAI\n\nKIA\n\nHONDA MOTOR EUROPE LTD\n\nSUZUKI POOL\n\nTOYOTA-MAZDA\nRENAULT\n\nPSA-OPEL\n\f\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\nMonitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from \nthe transport sector is a key priority for the EU.

Cars and light \ncommercial vehicles (vans) are responsible respectively \nfor\t44\t%\tand\t9\t%\tof\tthe\temissions\tof\tthe\ttransport\tsector.\n\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, \nthe European Parliament and the Council adopted two \nregulations, which introduced mandatory CO2 emission \nperformance standards for new passenger cars, and \nnew light commercial vehicles: \n\n\u2022 For new passenger cars, Regulation (EC) \nNo\u00a0443/2009\tsets\ta\ttarget\tof\t130\tgCO2/km for the \nEU fleet\u2011wide average CO2 emissions for the period \n2015 to 2019. A target of 95 gCO2/km has been set \nfor 2021 with a phase\u2011in starting in 2020.\n\n\u2022 For new light commercial vehicles, Regulation (EU) \nNo 510/2011 sets the target for the EU fleet\u2011wide \naverage CO2 emissions to 175 gCO2/km for the \nperiod 2017 to 2019. A target of 147 gCO2/km has \nbeen set for 2020.\n\nThese two Regulations have been replaced since \n1\u00a0January\t2020\ton\tby\tthe\tnew\tRegulation\t(EU)\t2019/631\t\n\n(EU, 2019) setting CO2 targets for new passenger cars \nand for new light commercial vehicles also for the \nperiod after 2020. The EU fleet\u2011wide targets for 2025 \nand 2030 are defined as a percentage reduction of the \n2021 starting point:\n\n\u2022 For new passenger cars, the Regulation requires \na\u00a015%\treduction\tfrom\t2025\ton\tand\ta\t37.5%\t\nreduction from 2030 on;\n\n\u2022 For new light commercial vehicles, the Regulation \nrequires\ta\t15%\treduction\tfrom\t2025\ton\tand\t\na\u00a031%\u00a0reduction\tfrom\t2030\ton.\n\nAccording to the Regulations, data on new registered \npassenger cars and vans, including their CO2 emissions, \nshall be collected each year by Member States and \nsubmitted to the European Commission. Manufacturers \ncan verify the data, and notify the Commission of any \nerrors. The Commission assesses the manufacturers' \ncorrections, and, where justified, takes them \ninto account for the calculation of their average \nCO2\u00a0emissions\tand\tspecific\temission\ttargets.\tThis\treport\t\npresents the data concerning the years 2010\u20112018. \n\nFor both cars and vans, the reported CO2 emissions \nare based upon the New European Driving Cycle \n(NEDC). Since 2018, countries have reported both \nCO2 emissions based on the old (NEDC) and new test \nprocedure (WLTP), the latter only for the newer models. \nFrom 2021, compliance assessment will be based on \nthe WLTP data.\n\n1 Introduction\n\n \nType approval emissions versus real-world emissions\n\nAccording to EU legislation, vehicles must be tested to verify that they comply with the required environmental, climate, \nsafety and security standards. To check that vehicles meet the official requirements for CO2 emissions, standardised \nmeasurements in laboratories are used. The results of these tests are the so\u2011called 'type approval' emissions.\n\nUntil September 2017, these tests were based on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Since then, the Worldwide \nHarmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) applies as the new type approval test procedure. The WLTP was developed \nto be more representative of real world driving conditions. From 2021 onwards, the WLTP will replace fully the NEDC for the \npurpose of the CO2 emission standards.\n\n(2)  All figures are calculated including emissions from international aviation and international shipping.\n\f\nMonitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 201812\n\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n2.1 Passenger cars\n\nThe final data presented in this report replace the \nprovisional data published by the EEA earlier in 2019, \ntaking into account corrections proposed by the \nmanufacturers. \n\nThe average CO2 emissions from the new passenger car \nfleet in the EU in 2018 were 120.8 gCO2/km (Figure\u00a02.1), \nwhich is an increase of 2.3 gCO2/km comparted to 2017.\n\nAfter a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost \n22\u00a0gCO2/km, average emissions from new passenger \ncars increased in 2017 by 0.4 gCO2/km. This upward \ntrend has continued in 2018 even though stricter \ntargets will start to apply from 2020 on.\n\nThe main factors contributing to the increase of \nnew passenger cars' emissions in 2018 include the \ngrowing\u00a0share\tof\tpetrol\tcars\tin\tnew\tregistrations\t\n(chapter 2.1.1), in particular in the sport utility \nvehicle\u00a0(SUV)\tsegment\t(chapter\t2.2.2).\tMoreover,\t\nthe\u00a0market\tpenetration\tof\tzero-\tand\tlow-emission\t\ncars,\u00a0including\telectric\tcars,\tremained\tlow\t\n(chapter\u00a02.2.1).\t\n\nIn order to identify the factors that have mostly \ninfluenced the increase in the CO2 average emissions \nover the last two years, the results of a simple \ndecomposition analysis is presented in Figure 2.2. \nThe\u00a0average\tCO2 average emissions of the two years is \ncalculated as the sum of the contributions coming from \ndifferent car segments (small, medium, large regular \n\n2 Average CO2 emissions from new \npassenger cars and vans\n\nFigure 2.1  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2/km) from new passenger cars, by fuel type (EU-28 and Iceland)\n\n50\n\n80\n\n110\n\n140\n\n170\n\n200\n\n230\n\nPetrol Diesel All fuels Targets\n\n130 gCO2/km\n\n95 gCO2/km\n\n0\n2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n13Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure 2.2  Decomposition analysis: average CO2 emissions changes observed for different car segments \n(small, medium, large regular cars and SUVs) (6) and fuel type (petrol and diesel). \n\n(3) The term 'regular cars' refers to passenger cars that are not SUV, as sedan or hatch back.\n(4) There is no universally accepted definition of the sport utility vehicle.

The sum of the differences between each \ncontribution is to the overall changes in average \nCO2\u00a0emissions\t(Figure 2.2).\n\nThe decreasing share of new registrations of diesel \ncar\tregistrations\tin\t2018\t(-26\t%)\ttogether\twith\tan\t\nincreasing share of petrol cars with comparatively \nhigher emissions contributed to an overall increase in \nthe average CO2 emissions. Amongst the petrol cars, \n\nSUVs had the highest increase of their contribution to \nthe total average CO2 emissions (+8.5 gCO2/km).\n\nOn average (Figure 2.3) the highest\u2011emitting cars were \nregistered in Estonia (132.4 gCO2/km), Luxemburg \n(131.4 gCO2/km), and Poland (129.8 gCO2/km).\tAs\u00a0in\t\nprevious years, the Netherlands (105.5 gCO2/km) \nregistered the lowest emitting new passenger car fleet. \nPortugal, Malta and Denmark followed, with average \nemissions below 110 gCO2/km (Figure 2.3). \n\nCompared with 2017, CO2 emissions decreased in only \nfive countries.\n\nCO2 emission changes (g CO2/km)\n\nIncrease Decrease Total\n\nDiesel-small Diesel-medium Diesel-large Diesel-SUV Petrol-small Petrol-medium Petrol-large Petrol-SUV Total increase\n\n2.68.5\n\n-0.012.8\n\n-0.2-0.5\n-1.0\n\n-6.0\n\n-0.9\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n14 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\n2.1.1 Vehicles are further shifting from diesel to petrol \n\nIn 2018, for the second year in a row more new petrol \ncars were registered than new diesel ones Table 2.1. \nDiesel\tcars\trepresented\t36\t%\tof\tthe\tnewly\tregistered\t\ncar fleet, almost 19 percentage points less than in 2011, \nthe year in which the percentage of diesel cars reached \nits\tmaximum\t(55\t%).\t\n\nFor the first year, the average CO2 emissions increased \nboth for petrol cars (from 121.6 to 123.5 gCO2/km,  \ni.e.\u00a0by\t1.5%)\tand\tfor\tdiesel\tcars\t(from\t117.9\tto\t\n121.8\u00a0gCO2/km,\ti.e.\tby\t3.2%).\tThe\tdifference\tin\taverage\t\nfuel efficiency between the diesel and petrol cars newly \nregistered in 2018 was only 1.7 gCO2/km, one of the \nlowest values observed since 2009 (Table 2.2).\n\nThe share of diesel cars in new registrations, however, \nstill differs strongly amongst countries. For example, \nin Portugal, Italy and Ireland, the share of diesel was \nhigher\tthan\t50%\t(Table 2.1), while in the Netherlands, \nFinland\tand\tHungary,\tthe\tshare\tis\tlower\tthan\t25\t%.\n\nEven if the vast majority of Europe's new cars remain \npowered by petrol or diesel, the registration of \nalternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) has been increasing over \nthe last two decades (Figure 2.4). This category included \nonly a few dual\u2011fuel cars in 2000, i.e. cars mostly able to \noperate on petrol and ethanol blends, but it exceeded \n\nhalf a million new vehicle registrations in 2009, due \nto scrappage schemes favouring the uptake of LPG \nand NG vehicles in Italy and France. In 2010/11 the \nregistrations\tof\tAFVs\tdecreased\tsignificantly\t(by\t62\t%),\t\ncaused mainly by the end of the scrappage schemes \nin\u00a0France\tand\tItaly.\n\nIn the recent years, the share of electric cars (both \nBEV and PHEV) has been growing quickly. In 2018, \nthere were almost 150 000 registrations of BEVs \nand\t150\u00a0000\u00a0registrations\tof\tPHEVs.\tTogether,\tthey\t\nrepresented\t2\t%\tof\tnew\tregistrations.\t\n\nFigure 2.5 shows the average CO2 emissions including \nand excluding electric cars (BEV and PHEV). The \ndifference between the two lines increases over the \nyears, and reached 2.0 gCO2/km\t(or\t1.6\t%)\tin\t2018.\n\nThere are major differences in the market shares of EVs \namong countries: countries with significant incentives \nfor EVs generally had a higher share of EVs, while in \ncountries without such incentives the sales of EVs \nremained low (EEA, 2018). \n\nIceland\trecorded\thigh\telectric\tcar\tmarket\tshares,\t15%.\t\nWithin the EU28, Sweden had the highest share of \nnew\telectric\tcars\tin\t2018:\taround\t8\t%\tof\tnew\tcars\twere\t\nPHEVs or BEVs. \n\nFigure 2.3  Average CO2 emissions by country in 2018 compared with the EU average (120.8 gCO2/km)\n\n105\n\n0\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\nNeth\nerla\n\nnds\n\nPortu\nga\n\nl\n\nMalta\n\nDenmark\n\nGre\nece\n\nFra\nnce\n\nIre\nland\n\nCro\natia Ita\n\nly\n\nFin\nland\n\nIce\nland\n\nSp\nain\n\nBelgi\num\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\n\nRomania\n\nSw\neden\n\nAustr\nia\n\nCyp\nru\n\ns\n\nUnite\nd Kingd\n\nom\n\nCze\nch\n\nia\n\nBulga\nria\n\nSlo\nva\n\nkia\n\nHunga\nry\n\nLit\nhuania\n\nLa\ntvi\n\na\n\nGerm\nany\n\nPoland\n\nLu\nxe\n\nmbourg\n\nEsto\nnia\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n15Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nDIESEL PETROL BEV LPG NG PHEV\n\nEU\u201128 and Iceland 36\u00a0 60\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 0.4\u00a0 1.0\u00a0\n\nAustria 41\u00a0 56\u00a0 2.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.7\u00a0\n\nBelgium 36\u00a0 61\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 1.8\u00a0\n\nBulgaria 37\u00a0 60\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 1.2\u00a0 0.9\u00a0 0.3\u00a0\n\nCyprus 39\u00a0 61\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.3\u00a0\n\nCzechia 31\u00a0 68\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.8\u00a0 0.1\u00a0\n\nGermany 32\u00a0 66\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 0.1\u00a0 0.3\u00a0 0.9\u00a0\n\nDenmark 33\u00a0 65\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.3\u00a0\n\nEstonia 25\u00a0 74\u00a0 0.3\u00a0 0.1\u00a0 0.4\u00a0 0.2\u00a0\n\nSpain 38\u00a0 60\u00a0 0.4\u00a0 1.1\u00a0 0.3\u00a0 0.4\u00a0\n\nFinland 22\u00a0 72\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 4.1\u00a0\n\nFrance 41\u00a0 57\u00a0 1.4\u00a0 0.1\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.6\u00a0\n\nUnited Kingdom 32\u00a0 66\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.9\u00a0\n\nGreece 36\u00a0 63\u00a0 0.1\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 0.2\u00a0\n\nCroatia 44\u00a0 55\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.1\u00a0\n\nHungary 23\u00a0 75\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.5\u00a0\n\nIreland 54\u00a0 44\u00a0 1.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.6\u00a0\n\nIceland 37\u00a0 47\u00a0 3.9\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.8\u00a0 11.0\u00a0\n\nItaly 52\u00a0 39\u00a0 0.3\u00a0 6.6\u00a0 2.0\u00a0 0.2\u00a0\n\nLithuania 23\u00a0 76\u00a0 0.4\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.1\u00a0\n\nLuxembourg 47\u00a0 51\u00a0 0.8\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.3\u00a0\n\nLatvia 36\u00a0 63\u00a0 0.5\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.1\u00a0\n\nMalta 29\u00a0 66\u00a0 3.3\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.1\u00a0\n\nNetherlands 12\u00a0 81\u00a0 5.9\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.9\u00a0\n\nPoland 26\u00a0 73\u00a0 0.1\u00a0 0.5\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.1\u00a0\n\nPortugal 54\u00a0 42\u00a0 2.0\u00a0 0.8\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 1.7\u00a0\n\nRomania 40\u00a0 58\u00a0 0.4\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.3\u00a0\n\nSweden 36\u00a0 54\u00a0 2.1\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 6.3\u00a0\n\nSlovenia 31\u00a0 68\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.0\u00a0 0.3\u00a0\n\nSlovakia 30\u00a0 69\u00a0 0.3\u00a0 0.7\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 0.2\u00a0\n\nTable 2.1  Share of new passenger cars per fuel type in 2018  (%)\n\nNote:  BEV\tare\tbattery\telectric\tvehicles,\tLPG\tare\tliquefied\tpetroleum\tgas\tvehicles,\tNG\tare\tnatural\tgas\tvehicles,\tPHEV\tare\tplug-in\thybrid\telectric\t\nvehicles \n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n16 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure 2.4  Trends in total registrations of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), 2000-2018\n\nNumber of registrations\n\n100 000\n\n200 000\n\n300 000\n\n400 000\n\n500 000\n\n600 000\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nAll Ethanol Electric Liquefied petroleum gas Natural gas Plug-in hybrid Hydrogen\n\n0\n\nFigure 2.5  Average CO2 emissions with and without electric cars (BEV and PHEV)\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2.0\n\n105\n\n0\n\n110\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\n145\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nBenefit from EVs\n\nBenefit from EVs (%)Average emissions (gCO2/km)\n\nAverage CO2 emissions including EVs Average CO2 emissions excluding EVs\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n17Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nOn the basis of the monitoring data, the average CO2 \nemissions for vehicles using different fuel types can \nbe calculated (Table 2.2).

With the new system (called Klimatbonus), buyers of passenger cars newly registered from \n1 July 2018 and with CO2\u00a0emissions\tlower\tthan\t60\tgCO2/km will receive a bonus depending on their CO2 emission. For \nbattery electric vehicles (BEV), the bonus is 60 000 SEK and for plug\u2011in hybrid (PHEV) with CO2\u2011emission of 60g/km the \nbonus\tis\t10\t000\tSEK.\tFor\tPHEV\temitting\tless\tthan\t60\u00a0gCO2/km, the 60 000 SEK bonus decreases by 833 SEK per g/km \nemitted.\n\n\u2022 Road tax: the annual road tax is calculated according to the CO2\u2011emission of the vehicle. The low\u2011emitting cars are \nexempt from the road tax for the first five years after registration.\n\n\u2022 Company cars: the private use of company cars in Sweden can be declared as a 'benefit in kind' in the tax declaration \nif the vehicle is electric. And therefore this reduces the amount of income taxes that needs to be paid on it. In \nNovember\u00a02017,\tcompany\tcars\taccounted\tfor\tapproximately\t70%\tof\tthe\tnew\telectric\tcar\tsales.\n\n\u2022 Other incentive as implementation of support scheme for private charging infrastructure. The Swedish government \nimposed as well the adoption of environment\u2011friendly and electric cars in government fleets\n\n(7) Tail\u2011pipe emissions are the exhaust emissions of the vehicles. There are no end\u2011of\u2011pipe emissions for BEVs and low end of pipe emissions for \nPHEVs However, BEVs and PHEVs produce indirect emissions when they are plugged into the electricity grid. The indirect emissions are not \ntaken into account in this report or in the regulation.\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n18 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nsame period. Figure 2.6, shows that diesel cars are \non average about 300 kg heavier than their petrol \ncounterparts.\n\nVehicle mass is a critical parameter in car design as it \nis linked closely to fuel consumption. Increasing the \nmass of the car leads to a rise in the energy needed \nto accelerate the car and an increase in the rolling \nresistance resulting in increased energy consumption \n(and thus, all other aspects remaining unchanged, \nCO2\u00a0emissions).\tIn\torder\tto\texamine\tthe\tquantitative\t\neffect of weight, several studies have been carried out \nwhich demonstrate that for an additional vehicle mass \nof 50 \u2013 200 kg, the increase of fuel consumption over \nvarious cycles and operating conditions ranges from \n5\u00a0to\t9%\t(Fontaras,\tet\tal.,\t2017).\n\nLooking at the engine power trend, a substantial \nincrease from 2011 to 2018 is observed (Figure 2.7). \nOn\u00a0average,\tpetrol\tand\tdiesel\tcars\tare\tabout\t17.5%\tand\t\n11.5%\trespectively\tmore\tpowerful\tin\t2018\tthan\tthey\t\nwere in 2011. In addition, it is worth stressing that the \nconventional diesel cars are generally more powerful \nthan petrol counterparts.\n\nAs discussed previously, the automotive industry \nhas been able to reduce CO2 emissions from new \n\npassenger cars and meet the 130g CO2/km target, \neven when delivering more powerful passenger cars \nto the market. One factor that helped this decoupling \nof emissions from engine power was the petrol engine \ndownsizing that has taken place in recent years. Engine \ndownsizing can be defined as the use of a smaller \nengine able to deliver the power of a larger engine by \napply technologies increasing the engine's efficiency, \nsuch as supercharging or turbocharging (see chapter 5).\n\nDiesel and petrol cars exhibit different trends as \nregards engine capacity. In general, the average engine \ncapacity of diesel remained stable during the eight\u2011year \nperiod (2010\u20112018), slightly above 1800 cc, whereas \nthe average engine capacity of petrol cars decreased \nby 90 cc over the same period.

In fact, in comparison with other \ncars within a given segment, SUVs have larger frontal \nareas and higher drag coefficients that have a negative \nimpact on fuel consumption and can weaken efforts to \nreduce CO2 emissions. \n\nIn the database, SUVs were identified using the \ncommercial name. The remaining vehicles were then \nclassified according to the segment definition in \nAnnex\u00a02.\n\nAccording to EEA analysis, the majority of new SUVs \nsold\twere\tpowered\tby\tpetrol\t(53%),\twith\taverage\t\nemissions\tof\t133\u00a0gCO2/km,\twhich\tis\t14\u00a0gCO2/km higher \nthan the average emissions of other new petrol cars. \nForty\u2011five percent of SUVs were diesel cars with average \n\nemissions of 129 gCO2/km, which is 13 gCO2/km higher \nthan the average emissions of other new diesel cars.\n\n2.2 Vans\n\nSince the start of the monitoring, and for the sixth \nyear in a row, the number of new van registrations has \nincreased (Annex 2). In 2018, 1.65 million new vans \nwere\tregistered\tin\tthe\tEU-28\tand\tIceland,\t2.6\t%\tmore\t\nthan in 2017. \n\nThose vans emitted on average 157.9 gCO2/km, which \nis 1.7 gCO2/km more than in 2017. Following a sharp \ndecrease in 2017, this is the first increase in average \nCO2 emissions from new vans since the Regulation \ncame into force in 2011. Many factors affected the \nincrease in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, \nincluding an increase in the mass, engine capacity and \nsize of the vehicle. The market share of petrol vans \nremained very remains limited but increased slightly \n\nFigure 2.9  SUVs market share for 2007-2018 \n\nNote:  2007\u20112016 data from JATO (JATO, 2019b) , 2017\u20112018 EEA dataset.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nNumber of SUVs (%)\n\nSmall Medium SUV Large\n\nDiesel 102.6 113.9 129.1 143.7\n\nPetrol 113.3 126.2 133.1 203.9\n\nTable 2.3  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2/km) by segment and fuel type\n\f\nAverage CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans\n\n21Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nto\u00a03.5\t%\t(from\t2.4%\tin\t2017).\tThe\tshare\tof\tzero-\tand\t\nlow-emission\tvans\tremained\tat\tthe\tsame\tlevel\t(1.7\t%)\t\nas in 2017. \n\nThe average CO2 emissions from vans increased \nbetween 2017 and 2018 in all countries, but six. \nThe\tdecrease\tvaried\tfrom\t0.3\u00a0gCO2/km in Ireland to \n5.9\u00a0gCO2/km in Romania, while the increases varied \nfrom 0.1 gCO2/km in Croatia to 10.4 gCO2/km in Latvia. \nNo major changes were observed in fleet composition \nor average mass in these countries.\n\nAll countries had average specific CO2 emissions from \nnewly registered vans in 2018 below 175 gCO2/km, \nwhich is the EU target since 2017 (Figure 5.3).

It has become mandatory for all new \npassenger cars since September 2018 and for all new \nvans from September 2019.\n\nCompared to the NEDC, WLTP is more representative \nof real driving conditions. The new test includes \na\u00a0greater\trange\tof\tdriving\tsituations,\tmore\tdynamic\t\nand\u00a0representative\taccelerations\tand\tdecelerations,\t\nmore realistic driving behaviour more realistic vehicle \ntest mass, and stricter test conditions that better \nrepresent real\u2011world driving conditions (EEA 2016). \n\nThe average CO2 emissions and the targets until \n2020 will be calculated using the NEDC values.

Five large manufacturers (10) were analysed, \ntaking into account aspects such as average yearly \nreported CO2\u00a0emissions,\ttotal\tnew\tregistrations\tin\tthe\t\nEU, the uptake of low or zero emission vehicles and \ntechnological developments.\n\nThe main technologies and fleet\u2011wide trends identified \nin the passenger car sector in the recent past which \nmay have influenced CO2 emissions either positively \nor\u00a0negatively\tare\tthe\tfollowing:\n\n\u2022 downsizing;\n\n\u2022 de\u2011dieselization; \n\n\u2022 introduction of new models;\n\n\u2022 electrification;\n\n\u2022 SUVs market.\n\n5.1 Downsizing \n\nOne of the most important strategies followed by \nmanufacturers to comply with the CO2 emission \n\n5 Factors affecting the performance of \ncars\u00a0manufacturers\n\nregulations was the replacement of bigger engines with \ncompact ones or, in other words, engine downsizing. \nThese compact engines provide the needed power, \nwhile reducing, at the same time, the fuel consumption \n(Patil, et al., 2017). \n\nThe increased performance in a downsized engine \nis achieved by adding a forced aspiration device \n(turbocharger or supercharger) accompanied by other \nengine technologies such as direct injection technology \nor variable valve timing (VVT). The major advantages \nof a direct injection engine are increased fuel \nefficiency and high\u2011power output. VVT is the process \nof\u00a0optimising\tthe\ttiming\tof\ta\tvalve\tlift\tevent,\tand\tis\t\noften used to improve performance, fuel economy \nand\u00a0to\treduce\temissions.\n\nAs a cost\u2011effective technique, engine downsizing \nhas been implemented by the majority of cars \nmanufactures\t(Leduc,\u00a0et\tal.,\t2003;\tTartakovsky,\tand\t\nGutman, 2012).\n\nTo examine how the engine downsizing has influenced \npassenger cars over the years, the example of Ford is \npresented in Figure 5.1.\n\nFord relied heavily on the downsizing of the engines, \nespecially for petrol cars. In fact, the average engine \ncapacity\tdecreased\tby\t17\t%\tbetween\t2010-2018,\twhile\t\naverage\tengine\tpower\tincreased\tby\t28\t%\tcompared\tto\t\n2011 levels. This downsizing effect largely contributed \nto the reduction of the average CO2 emissions, up until \n2015\t(by\t16\t%\tcompared\tto\t2010\tdata).\t\n\n5.2 De-dieselisation \n\nIn general, diesel cars emit less CO2 than equivalent \npetrol cars with similar characteristics. Therefore, \nsupported by policies in many Member States, diesel \nvehicles have dominated the EU market reaching a \n55\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\tshare\tin\t2011.\tBy\t2015,\tdespite\ta\tsmall\t\ndrop\tin\tthe\tshare\tof\tdiesel\tcars\t(52\u00a0%),\tthey\tremained\t\n\n(9)  2018 data used for the analysis are provisional data.\n(10)  Volkswagen (VW), Toyota, BMW Group, Ford Group and Renault.\n\f\nFactors affecting the performance of cars manufacturers\n\n35Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nthe predominant choice of EU consumers. Since \nSeptember 2015, following the 'Diesel scandal', the \nshare of diesel cars started to drop, and this trend was \nstronger in the last two years, with the diesel car share \nin\tthe\tnew\tfleet\treaching\tabout\t36\t%\tin\t2018.\tInstead,\t\npetrol vehicles are now dominating the new car market. \n\nThis shift from diesel to petrol cars is one of the \nreasons why the average CO2 emissions in the EU \nhave\u00a0increased\tin\t2017\tand\t2018.\n\nTo examine how de\u2011dieselisation has influenced \npassenger cars over the years, the BMW example \nis\u00a0presented\tin\tFigure 5.2.\n\nFor both diesel and petrol cars, BMW has, compared to \nthe other large car manufacturers, one of the highest \naverage mass, engine capacity and engine power by \na sizable margin. This is expected as BMW historically \nproduces larger, more luxurious, and high\u2011performance \ncars (such as the X series) rather than smaller cars. \nAs\u00a0effect,\ttheir\taverage\tCO2 emissions is one of the \nhighest among the larger cars manufactures, during \nthe\u00a0period\t2010-2018.\n\nThe average CO2 emissions decreased significantly \n(almost\t15\u00a0%)\tfrom\t2010\tto\t2017.\tFor\tthe\tlarger\tpart,\t\nthis can be directly attributed to powertrain efficiency \nand vehicle design improvements, most notably smaller, \nturbocharged, more efficient engines (downsizing). \n\nNevertheless, in 2018 there was an increase in the \naverage\temissions,\tby\talmost\t5\u00a0%,\tcompared\tto\t2017.\t\nThis is mainly related to the increased share of petrol \ncars: compared to 2017, in 2018, BMW diesel new \nregistrations\tdecreased\tby\tabout\t20\u00a0%\twhile\tpetrol\tnew\t\nregistrations\tincreased\tby\tabout\t27\u00a0%,\trepresenting\t\n45\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tfleet\tin\t2018\t(35\t%\tin\t2017).\tOn\taverage,\t\nBMW petrol cars emit 8 gCO2/km more than diesel cars.\n\nEven if it is true that, in general, a diesel car emits \nless than an equivalent petrol version, the effect \nof dieselisation on cars manufacturers depends as \nwell on the type of petrol and diesel cars that the \nmanufacturer\u00a0produces.\t\n\nAlthough one would expect that the decline in diesel \nshare would negatively affect the overall CO2 emissions, \nthis is not the case for Volkswagen.

In 2018, diesel cars are \n24\t%\theavier\tand\thave\t48\t%\tbigger\tengine\tcapacity,\t\ncompared to their petrol counterparts, resulting in \nhigher average CO2 emissions. Hence, the smaller \ndiesel share of new sales has a positive effect on the \noverall average CO2 emissions.\n\n5.3 Upgrades to the most sold models in \nrecent year\n\nThe study looked into the most sold vehicles for the \n5\u00a0manufacturers\tanalysed.\t\n\nAs example, Renault Clio is the most sold Renault car. \nIt\taccounted\tfor\tover\t2\u00a0%\tof\tall\tnew\tpassenger\tcar\tsales\t\nin the EU in 2017 (ICCT, 2018). In 2013, the introduction \nof the new Renault IV model led to a noticeable drop \nin average CO2\temissions\t(10\t%)\t(Figure 5.4). The \nRenault Clio IV was equipped with a new generation of \ndownsized petrol engines (such as the Energy TCe 90) \nand diesel engines (such as the Energy dCI 90), which \nwere introduced around the same time period and \nwere designed to offer better fuel efficiency.\n\nAfter 2014, the CO2 emissions of the petrol version \nstabilized, while the emissions of the diesel version \nslightly decreased until 2016 then rising in the last \ntwo years to the same level of 2013. This may be due \nto their increasing average mass, as average engine \ncapacity remained constant throughout the years. \n\n5.4 Penetration of electric vehicles \n\nElectrified cars are gradually increasing their share in \nnew passenger car sales nowadays. This is triggered \nin particular by the need to reduce emissions of \nCO2\u00a0and,\tparticularly\tin\turban\tareas,\tair\tpollutants\tsuch\t\nas NOx\u00a0and\tPM.\tIn\tthe\tETC\treport,\tHEV\thave\tbeen\tas\t\nwell\u00a0identified\tand\tincluded\tin\tthe\tanalysis\t\n\nMore than other manufacturers, Toyota moved away \nfrom conventional cars, especially diesel, and promoted \nmore hybridised powertrains. As a matter of fact \nToyota announced its plans to completely phase out \ndiesel cars by the end of 2018, due to limited demand \nand widespread uptake of hybrid alternatives (HEV) \n(Toyota, 2018).\n\nIn 2018 despite the abrupt rise in CO2 emissions of \ndiesel cars, the overall CO2 emissions are significantly \nlower\tthan\tin\t2010\t(-\t20\t%).\tThis\tis\trelated\tto\tthe\tfact\t\nthat\tthe\tdiesel\tshare\tis\trather\tsmall\t(5\t%)\tand\tthe\tHEV\t\nregistrations, with an average emissions of 93 gCO2/km, \n\nFigure 5.4  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2 /km) of Renault Clio \n\nPetrol Diesel Total conventional\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013\n\nOctober 2012:\nIntroduction\nof new Clio IV\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n140\n\n130\n\n110\n\n120\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\f\nFactors affecting the performance of cars manufacturers\n\n38 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nrepresents\tmore\tthan\t56\t%\tof\tthe\tnew\tregistrations\tin\t\n2018 (Figure 5.5).\n\n5.5 Increase in sport utility vehicle sales \noffsets technological improvement\n\nManufacturers are heavily promoting new SUV and \nso\u2011called crossover models, available in a range of \nsizes and power output. As a result, the share of SUV \nsurged in recent years, as illustrated in Figure 5.6. This \ntendency is closely related to the increase in average \nmass, in the 2015\u20112018 timeframe, which applies to all \nselected manufacturers. \n\nBecause SUVs are typically larger, heavier and less \naerodynamic than medium sized passenger cars, they \nconsume more fuel and hence they emit more CO2. \nOne may argue that the surge in SUV demand is, at \nleast partially, cancelling out the environmental benefit \n\nfrom CO2 reduction technologies already employed in \nmodern cars, as well as the benefit from the increasing \nmarket share of the so\u2011called zero and low\u2011emission \npassenger cars (i.e. HEV, PHEV, BEV).\n\nAs an example, the average CO2 emissions of \nVolkswagen SUVs (Figure 5.7) follow a downward trend \n(20\u00a0%\treduction\tsince\t2010).\tNevertheless,\tin\tabsolute\t\nnumbers the average emissions (135 gCO2/km in \n2018) remain higher than small and medium sized \ncars (Figure\u00a05.3). This downward trend is related to the \ntechnological development in modern powertrains and \nvehicle design. In more recent years, this trend can be \nalso attributed to the introduction of smaller (both in \nvehicle and engine size) and more aerodynamically \nefficient SUV (often characterized as Crossovers). \nExamples of such models are the newer T\u2011Roc and \nT\u2011Cross models, compared to the bulkier Tuareg and \nTiguan models.\n\nFigure 5.5  Average CO2 emissions (gCO2/km) by fuel for Toyota \n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n95\n\n85\n\n105\n\n115\n\n125\n\n135\n\n145\n\nNumber of vehicles (thousand)\n\n0\n\n155\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\n450\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nEVs registrations Petrol Diesel EVsAll\n\f\nFactors affecting the performance of cars manufacturers\n\n39Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure 5.6:  Market share of new SUV compared to total new registrations (2018)\n\nNumber of SUV (%)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nVW Toyota BMW Ford Renault\n\n0\n\nFigure 5.7  Volkswagen SUVs: Average CO2 emissions by fuels (gCO2/km)\n\n140\n\n130\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nNumber of vehicles (thousand)\n\n0\n\n180\n\nAverage emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\n450\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSUVs registrations Petrol Diesel All\n\f\nMonitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 201840\n\nReferences\n\nEEA, 2016, Explaining road transport emissions \u2014 \na\u00a0non\u2011technical guide, European Environment Agency \n(https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/explaining\u2011\nroad\u2011transport\u2011emissions).\n\nEU, 2009, Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting \nemission performance standards for new passenger \ncars as part of the Community's integrated approach \nto reduce CO2 emissions from light\u2011duty vehicles, \nOJ\u00a0L\u00a0140,\t5.6.2009,\tp.\t1-15.\n\nEEA, 2018, Appropriate taxes and incentives do affect \npurchases of new cars, EEA Briefing, European \nEnvironment Agency (https://www.eea.europa.eu/\nthemes/transport/vehicles\u2011taxation/appropriate\u2011taxes\u2011\nand incentives\u2011do).\n\nEU, 2011, Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting \nemission performance standards for new light \ncommercial vehicles as part of the Union's integrated \napproach to reduce CO2 emissions from light\u2011duty \nvehicles, OJ L 145, 31.5.2011, pp. 1\u201118.\n\nEU, 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 setting \nCO2 emission performance standards for new \npassenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles, \nand repealing Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) \nNo 510/2011.\n\nFontaras, G., Zacharof, N. and Cuiffo, B., 2017, 'Fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions from passenger cars \nin Europe \u2014 Laboratory versus real\u2011world emissions', \nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 60, 97\u2011131.\n\nReferences\n\nICCT, 2018, European vehicle market statistics, \npocketbook 2017/2018, International Council on \nClean Transportation, Berlin, Germany (https://\ntheicct.org/publications/european\u2011vehicle\u2011market\u2011\nstatistics\u201120172018) accessed 26 September 2018.\n\nJATO, 2019a, 'Global SUV boom continues in 2018 but \ngrowth moderates' (https://www.jato.com/global\u2011suv\u2011\nboom\u2011continues\u2011in\u20112018\u2011but\u2011growth\u2011moderates/) \naccessed 27 November 2019.\n\nJATO, 2019b, 'Global SUV boom continues in 2018 but \ngrowth moderates'.\n\nJRC, 2018, 'CO2MPAS: Vehicle simulator predicting \nNEDC CO2 emissions from WLTP \u2014 CO2MPAS 2.0.0+9.\ng5b3144d documentation' (https://co2mpas.io/) \naccessed 26 September 2018.\n\nLeduc, P., Dubar, B., Ranini, A. and Monnier, G., 2003, \n'Downsizing of gasoline engine: An efficient way to \nreduce CO2 emissions'.\n\nPatil, C., Varade, S. and Wadkar, S., 2017, 'A review of \nengine downsizing and its effects', International Journal \nof Current Engineering and Technology Special Issue 7, \npp. 319\u2011324.\n\nTartakovsky, L. and Gutman, M., 2012, Energy efficiency \nof road vehicles \u2011 trends and challenges, E.F.

The notification \nmust be submitted within 3 months from the \nnotification of the provisional calculations.\n\nAs it does for countries' data, the EEA performs several \nquality checks to evaluate the accuracy and the quality \nof the data that have been corrected in the notification \nof errors. The verification process is very similar to the \none performed for countries' data presented in the \nprevious paragraphs. After this additional quality check, \nthe database is finalised.\n\nBased on the final data, the EEA calculates the \nperformance of car and van manufacturers in meeting \ntheir CO2 emission targets. The performance is \ncalculated as the difference between the average CO2 \nspecific emissions and the specific emission target for \neach manufacturer. The Commission notifies each \nmanufacturer (and pool) of the final calculations and \nthe provisional data are published on the EEA website.\n\nCalculation of average CO2 specific \nemissions\n\nAverage specific CO2 emissions are calculated as a \nweighted average of the manufacturer's fleet registered \nin a particular year. The average specific emissions for \neach manufacturer are subsequently adjusted to take \ninto account the following modalities (summarised in \nTable A1. 1):\n\n\u2022 phase\u2011in;\n\n\u2022 super\u2011credits;\n\n\u2022 eco\u2011innovations.\n\nPhase-in\n\nA phase\u2011in provision applies for calculating the average \nspecific emissions for cars in 2020: for assessing \ncompliance against the specific emission targets in \nthat\tyear,\tonly\tthe\t95\u00a0%\tbest-performing\tcars\tof\teach\t\nmanufacturer or pool will be taken into account.

These vehicles \nare temporarily given a greater weight when calculating \nthe average specific emissions of a manufacturer, as \nfollows: each such car is counted as 2 cars in 2020, \n1.67\u00a0cars\tin\t2021\tand\t1.33\tcars\tin\t2022.\tOver\tthe\tperiod\t\n2020-2022,\tthe\u00a0use\tof\tsuper-credits\twill\tbe\tsubject\tto\t\na\u00a0cap\tof\t7.5\u00a0gCO2/km for each manufacturer. For vans, \nno super\u2011credit scheme exists from 2018 on.\n\nEco-innovations\n\nFor certain innovative technologies which produce \nreal\u2011world CO2 savings, those cannot be demonstrated \nunder the applicable type\u2011approval test procedure. \nTo support technical development, a manufacturer \nor supplier can apply to the Commission for the \napproval of such innovative technologies. The approval \nconditions are set out in Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 \nfor cars and Regulation (EU) No 427/2014 for vans. \nIf\u00a0a\u00a0manufacturer\tfits\tits\tvehicle\t(car\tor\tvans)\tfleet\twith\t\nan approved eco\u2011innovation, the average emissions \nof\u00a0that\u00a0manufacturer\tmay\tbe\treduced\tby\ta\tmaximum\t\nof\u00a07\u00a0gCO2/km. \n\nCalculation of specific emission targets\n\nFor each manufacturer annual specific emissions target \nis defined, calculated on the basis of the fleet\u2011wide \ntarget\tand\tthe\taverage\t'mass\tin\trunning\torder'\u00a0(17) \nof\u00a0the\tregistered\tvehicles.\t\n\n(16) In addition to VINs, manufacturers may submit detailed monitoring data for the vehicles registered.\n(17) According to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, mass in running order means the mass of the car with bodywork, coolant, oils, fuel, spare wheel, \n\ntools and driver as stated in the certificate of conformity and defined in Section 2.6 of Annex I to Directive 2007/46/EC.\n\f\nAnnex 1\n\n43Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nThe following formulae applied for calculating the \nspecific emission targets for passenger cars (1) and \nvans (2) until 2019 (included):\n\nPassenger\tcars:\t130\u00a0+\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M0) (1)\n\nVans:\t175\u00a0+\u00a0a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M0) (2)\n\nwhere:\n\nM is the average mass of the manufacturer's fleet \nin\u00a0kilograms;\n\nM0\tis\tthe\treference\tmass\t(1\u00a0392.4\u00a0kg);\n\na is 0.0457 for passenger cars and 0.093 for vans.\n\nThis means that, for example, if the average mass \nof a manufacturer's newly registered passenger car \nfleet\tin\ta\tgiven\tyear\tis\t1\u00a0392.4\u00a0kg,\tthe\ttarget\tfor\tthat\t\nmanufacturer\tis\t130.0\u00a0gCO2/km.\n\nIf the average mass of the newly registered passenger \ncar\tfleet\tis\t1\u00a0492.4\u00a0kg,\tthe\ttarget\tfor\tthat\tmanufacturer\t\nis\t134.57\u00a0gCO2/km.

The pools are \nlisted in Annex 4. \n\nDerogations\n\nFor passenger cars, manufacturers selling fewer than \n10\u00a0000\tvehicles\tper\tyear\tcan\tapply\tfor\ta\tsmall-volume\t\nderogation. In this case, a specific emission target \ncan be granted consistent with the manufacturer's \neconomic and technological potential to reduce specific \nCO2 emissions. \n\nNiche derogations are provided for manufacturers \nresponsible\tfor\tbetween\t10\u00a0000\tand\t300\u00a0000\tnew\tcar\t\nregistrations.

For a WLTP interpolation family \ntwo parameters are defined in this respect:\n\n\u2022 deviation factor, De: it is the relative difference \nbetween the result of a random physical test to \nbe performed by a selection of vehicles and the \nmanufacturer declared value;\n\n\u2022 verification factor, Vf: When performing physical \ntests the correctness of the correlation input data \nshould be verified.

Small cars constitute most of the sales, \nfollowed by medium\u2011sized cars. Large cars constitute \nonly\ta\tminor\tshare,\tin\tthe\torder\tof\t4\u00a0%.\tOver\tthe\tperiod\t\n2010\u20112015, small cars have significantly strengthened \ntheir\tshare:\twhereas\tin\t2010\tthey\trepresented\t68\u00a0%\t\nof the market, in 2015 they increased their share by \n9\u00a0percentage\tpoints,\tconstituting\t77\u00a0%\tof\tall\tpetrol\tcars.\t\nIn the last 3 years, however, the percentage of small \ncars\thas\tsignificantly\tdecreased\tto\tthe\t2010\tlevel\t(67\u00a0%)\t\nin favour of medium and large cars.\n\nAs for diesel cars (Figure A2.2), the highest share of the \nmarket belongs to medium cars. Small and large cars \nhold minor shares. The trend observed in recent years \nis that the share of mid\u2011range cars has grown mainly at \nthe expense of small size cars.\n\nFigure A2.1 Market share per segment for petrol passenger cars\n\nSegment share (%)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n68 69 71 73 76 77 76 74\n67\n\n28 28 27 24 22 21 21 23\n30\n\n4 3 3 2 2 2 3 3 4\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nPetrol - small Petrol - medium Petrol - large\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n46 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nAs expected, larger cars generally had higher \nCO2\u00a0emissions\t(Figure A2.3 and Figure A2.4). However, \na decreasing trend in CO2 emissions is observed for all \nsegments. The CO2 emissions reductions are highest \nfor\u00a0larger\tcars\tand\trather\tmarginal\tfor\tsmaller\tones.\t\n\nRemarkable is the difference in the CO2 emissions of \nthe large size between petrol and diesel conventional \ncars. Specifically, Large\u2011petrol had extra emissions of \nup to 68 g/km compared to Large\u2011diesel. Though, their \ndifference has fallen towards the end of the time series \nto 52.4 gCO2/km in 2017.\n\nFor diesel cars segment an increase of emissions is \nobserved between 2018 and 2017from 0.2 gCO2/km  \nfor the small size car to almost 7 gCO2/km for the big \nones. For conventional petrol cars, large saw a small \nreduction in CO2\temissions\tof\taround\t2\u00a0gCO2/km,  \nmedium and small cars slightly increased their \nCO2\u00a0emissions\tby\tabout\t0.5\u00a0and\t1.0\tgCO2/km, \nrespectively, in the last year.\n\nThe peculiar behaviour of mini\u2011petrol cars, which \nfor several years had higher CO2 emissions than \nsmall\u2011petrol cars, is attributed to the fact that mini \ncars recorded a very small market share, which was \nnegligible towards the end of the time series.\n\nAlmost all size categories have seen an increase in the \nmass of the car since 2010, except large\u2011diesel cars, for \nwhich\tthe\tmass\thad\treduced\tby\tabout\t10\u00a0kg\tin\t2018\t\ncompared with 2010 ( Figure A2.5 and Figure A2.6). \nHowever, it should be noted that the changes in mass \nwere generally quite mild (from 40 kg to 100kg for the \nperiod 2010\u20112018), with the most intense occurring in \nthe small segment, in which the mass of petrol cars \nincreased\tby\t6\u00a0%\tand\tthe\tmass\tof\tdiesel\tcars\tincreased\t\nby\t8.5\u00a0%\tin\tthe\tperiod\t2010-2018.\n\nCars have become more powerful over the past 8 years, \nand this applies to all size classes and to both petrol and \ndiesel engines (Figure A2.7 and Figure A2.8). The large \npetrol cars sold were much more powerful than the \nlarge diesel ones.\n\nRegarding the other size categories (medium and \nsmall), petrol powertrains are slightly more powerful \nthan the corresponding diesel ones. This is because in \nsimilar engine sizes, a petrol engine will have greater \npower than a diesel engine because it can run at higher \nrotational speeds and power is directly proportional to \nthe speed. However, at lower speeds a diesel engine \ncan produce higher torque than a petrol engine.\n\nFigure A2.2 Market share per segment for diesel passenger cars\n\n11 11 9 7 6 4 4 3 2\n\n75 75 77 78 79 81 83 84 86\n\n14 14 14 15 15 15 13 13 12\n\nSegment share (%)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nDiesel - small Diesel - medium Diesel - large\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n47Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure A2.3 Trends in CO2 emissions of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n250\n\n225\n\n200\n\n175\n\n125\n\n150\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\nPetrol CO2 emissions (g/km)\n\n0\n\nFigure A2.4 Trends in CO2 emissions of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n200\n\n175\n\n125\n\n150\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\nDiesel average emissions (gCO2/km)\n\n0\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n48 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure A2.5 Trends in mass of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n1 400\n\n1 200\n\n1 000\n\n800\n\n400\n\n600\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2 000\n\n1 800\n\n1 600\n\nMass (kg)\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\nFigure A2.6 Trends in mass of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n1 500\n\n1 000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2 500\n\n2 000\n\nMass (kg)\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n49Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n350\n\n300\n\n200\n\n250\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\nEngine power (kW)\n\n0\n\nFigure A2.7 Trends in engine power of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\nFigure A2.8 Trends in engine power of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n180\n\n160\n\n120\n\n140\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nEngine power (kW)\n\n0\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n50 Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nFigure A2.9 Trends in engine capacity of petrol passenger cars per segment\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n3 000\n\n2 500\n\n2 000\n\n1 500\n\n1 000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n4 000\n\n3 500\n\nEngine capacity (cm3)\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\nFigure A2.10 Trends in engine capacity of diesel passenger cars per segment\n\nLarge Medium Small Mini\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n3 000\n\n2 500\n\n2 000\n\n1 500\n\n1 000\n\n500\n\nEngine capacity (cm3)\n\n0\n\f\nAnnex 2\n\n51Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\n\nRegarding engine capacity, a small decreasing engine \ndisplacement trend was observed over the period for \nalmost all segments (Figure A2.9 and Figure A2.10). \n\nMedium\u2011sized cars' capacity remained almost stable \nfor both petrol and diesel powertrains over the period \n2010\u20112018.

cars registered in all EU Member States. The scheduling for the monitoring is the following:\nThe data are required for the calculation by the Commission of the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars and for setting the specific emissions targets that shall be met by car manufacturers. The database provides the detailed data without taking into account other factors required for the calculation of specific emissions targets (such as phase-in percentages, credits for low emitting vehicles and E85 fuelled vehicles, or eco-innovation credits) that vary over the years . In order to calculate the average specific emissions and specific emission targets the Commission considers only those vehicles for which emission and mass are available.\nData visualization\nDiscodata is an SQL Server Rest Endpoint provided by EEA allowing for access to various datasets including CO2 emission for cars. The dataset available contains all years of available data including both provisional final data. Please pay attention to both the year and the status field. The status field can have two values P=Provisional and F=Final. When extracting data, you should always select either Provisional or Final to avoid redundancy.

Key reasons include the growth in the sport utility vehicle segment and an increased average mass. In 2019, average CO2 emissions from all new cars reached 122.3 g CO2/km. Although this is below the EU fleet-wide target of 130 g CO2/km set for the period 2015-2019, it is well above the 2021 target of 95 g CO2/km, phased-in in 2020. Most car manufacturers met their individual binding CO2 emission targets for fleets of newly registered passenger cars in 2019.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|year||Average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars||EU fleet-wide target for new passenger cars||2020 Target for new passenger cars (95 gCO2/km)||Average CO2 emissions from new petrol passenger cars||Average CO2 emissions from new diesel passenger cars|\n|2000||172.1||177.4||160.3|\n|2001||169.7||175.3||159.7|\n|2002||167.2||173.5||158.1|\n|2003||165.5||171.7||157.7|\n|2004||163.4||170||156.2|\n|2005||162.4||168.1||156.5|\n|2006||161.3||164.9||157.9|\n|2007||158.7||161.6||156.3|\n|2008||153.5||156.6||151.2|\n|2009||145.7||147.6||145.3|\n|2010||140.3||142.5||139.3|\n|2011||135.7||137.6||134.5|\n|2012||132.2||133.7||131.5|\n|2013||126.7||128.5||126.9|\n|2014||123.4||125.6||123.2|\n|2015||119.5||130||122.5||119.2|\n|2016||118.1||121.7||116.8|\n|2017||118.5||121.6||117.9|\n|2018||120.8||123.4||121.5|\n|2019||122.3|\n|2020||95||95|\n|2021|\n|2022|\n|2023|\n|2024|\n|2025||80.8|\n|2026|\n|2027|\n|2028|\n|2029|\n|2030||59.4|\nEmissions from transport account for one quarter of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, compared with 1990 levels, in order for the EU to become climate-neutral by 2050, while also working towards a zero-pollution ambition.\nTo reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, emission performance standards for new cars were introduced in 2009setting a fleet-wide target of 130 g CO2/km for the period 2015-2019 and 95 g CO2/km for the period 2020-2024, as well as specific CO2 emission targets for each manufacturer (or pool of manufacturers). In 2019, a new Regulationset new fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030, namely a 15% reduction from 2021 emission levels by 2025 and a 37.5% reduction by 2030.\nAfter a steady decline between 2010 and 2016, by almost 22 g CO2/km, average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017, 2018 and 2019, reaching 122.3 g CO2/km in 2019. Although this remains below the 2015-2019 target of 130 g CO2/km, it is well above the 2020-2024 target of 95 g CO2/km.\nThere are various reasons for the increase in emissions, for instance the growth in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment of the road transport sector. Almost 15.5 million new cars were registered in 2019 in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and about 38% of these were SUVs. SUVs are typically heavier than other cars and have more powerful engines and larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase fuel consumption. Most new SUVs registered were petrol vehicles, with average emissions of 134 g CO2/km, which is around 13 g CO2/km higher than other new petrol cars. Moreover, the average mass of new conventional cars, excluding SUV, increased by around 22 kg from 2018 to 2019.\nThe market penetration of electric cars remained low in 2019 and, as in 2018, petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, constituting 59% of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles constituted 31% of new registrations. Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles did continue to increase, however, reaching about 3.5% in 2019, compared with 2% in 2018. Non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are exclusively fuelled by conventional fuels, represented around 4% of new registrations. Registrations of electric vehicles, as a percentage of all newly registered cars, were highest in Norway (56%), Iceland (19%), the Netherlands (16%) and Sweden (12%). These countries were also among the few where the average emissions of new cars fell between 2018 and 2019.

Pools or individual manufacturers responsible for fewer than 300,000 newly registered cars may benefit from a derogation.\nIn 2019, almost all car manufacturers, either individually, or as members of pools or because of derogations, met their annual binding targets for newly registered passenger car fleets in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. Only four manufacturers, registering less than 13,000 vehicles a year, Automobili Lamborghini SPA, Bentley, Maserati and SsangYong, exceeded their emission targets.\nAmong the larger manufacturers, Toyota achieved the best CO2 performance, with average specific emissions of 108 g CO2/km, being closest to its 2020 objective. This performance was closely followed by those of Automobile Citroen and Peugeot, with average CO2 emissions of around 110 g CO2/km.", "Projection of CO2 emissions from road transport ETC/ACC Technical Paper 2010/2128 Feb 2011\nPrepared by: Giorgos Mellios, Christos Samaras, Leonidas Ntziachristos of ETC/ACC partner Aristotle University Thessaloniki (LAT/AUTh)\nPublished by: ETC/ACC, February 2011, 30 pp.\n\nCO2 monitoring database\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n    \n \n\nProjection of CO2 emissions \n\n\nfrom road transport \n\n\nETC/ACC Technical Paper 2010/21 \n\nFebruary 2011 \n\n\nGiorgos Mellios, Christos Samaras, \n\nLeonidas Ntziachristos \n\n\nThe European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC) \n\nis a consortium of European institutes under contract of the European Environment Agency\n\n\nPBL UBA-D UBA-V NILU AEAT AUTh CHMI MET.NO \u00d6KO TNO REC\n \n\f\n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFront page picture: \nRoad transport somewhere in The Netherlands (RIVM Beeldbank)  \n\nAuthor affiliation: \nAll authors are from the Laboratory Of Applied Thermodynamics, Mechanical Engineering Department, Aristotle University Thessaloniki, Greece. \n\nDISCLAIMER \n\n\nThis ETC/ACC Technical Paper has not been subjected to European \nEnvironment Agency (EEA) member country review.

The objective of this task is to project the mean CO2 emissions of the European passenger \ncars stock in real\u00adworld conditions to 2020, assuming different scenarios towards reaching the target \nof 95 g/km as an average of new car registrations. To this aim, a simulation exercise divided in two \nsteps has been implemented. First, we have simulated the expected CO2 emissions of forthcoming \nvehicle technologies in type\u00adapproval and real\u00adworld conditions. Second, we have simulated different \npenetration rates of these technologies in the European stock, based on established projections of \nstock growth in Europe. The study demonstrates that reaching an new registration average of \n95 g/km may lead to different CO2 emissions in the real world, depending on the mix of technologies \nconsidered to meet the type\u00adapproval target. \n\nKeywords \n\nCO2 emissions, passenger cars, hybrids, electric vehicles with range extender \n\nInternet reference \n\nVersion / Date \n\nFinal Version / 04 February 2011 \n\nClassification statement \n\nPUBLIC \n\nNo of Pages \n\n28 \n\nPrice \n\nFREE \n\nDeclassification date Bibliography \n\nYES \n\n3 \n\nhttp://lat.eng.auth.gr/\f\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0    \u00a0\n\n\u00a0    \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0    \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0   \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nContents\n\u00ad\n\n.

Introduction \u2013 Objectives \n\nThe voluntary agreement of the European Commission with the automotive industry \n(Commission Recommendation 1999/125/EC) was the first attempt of the European Union to \nset CO2 emission targets for new passenger cars. In this process, although significant emission \nreductions were achieved by the vehicle manufacturers in view of the 140 g/km target by \n2008/09, it was not made eventually possible to reach the reductions proposed in this \nvoluntary agreement. \n\nAs a result, the European Parliament and the Council issued Regulation No. 443/2009 \nintroducing mandatory CO2 emissions limits for new passenger cars. The regulation specifies \nthat each vehicle manufacturer must achieve a fleet-average CO2 emission target of 130 g/km \nby 2015 for all new cars registered in the EU. In order to meet the CO2 emission target of \n120 g/km, a further reduction of 10 g/km is to be provided by additional measures, such as the \nuse of biofuels. According to the regulation, a so-called limit value curve sets specific emissions \ntargets for each manufacturer based on the average vehicle mass sold by the particular \nmanufacturer. The formula to calculate the limit value curve is: \n\nPermitted specific emissions of CO2 = 130 + a \u00d7 (M \u2013 M0) \n\nWhere M is the reference vehicle mass (in kg), M0 = 1289 kg is a mass constant and a = 0.0457. \nThis is an empirical curve which has been developed in order not to distort the market, taking \ninto account the different market segments of various vehicle manufacturers. That curve is set \nin such a way that heavier cars will have to improve more than lighter cars compared to today, \nbut that manufacturers will still be able to make cars with emissions above the limit value \ncurve provided these are balanced by cars which are below the curve. \n\nThe regulation also defines a long-term target of 95 g/km to be reached by 2020. From 2016 \nonwards, the value of M0 will be annually adjusted to reflect the average mass of passenger \ncars in the previous three calendar years. \n\nManufacturers' progress will be monitored each year by the Member States on the basis of \nnew car registration data. To this aim, it is important that the manufacturer is clearly identified \nand distinguished from the make1. Table 1 below shows the actual position of the most \nprominent car manufacturers in terms of the average CO2 emissions of the new cars they \nmanufactured in 2006.

It is not possible to estimate the \ncorresponding emission reductions required for 2020, as the M0 of the limit curve has not been \ndetermined yet (it will be calculated on the basis of the average mass of passenger cars in the \nprevious three calendar years, i.e. 2017-2019). Assuming the same limit curve and average \nmass, the reductions required to achieve the 2020 target have been also calculated and are \nshown in the same table. If the average mass of the vehicle increases (as it historically does) \nthe necessary reductions should be even larger than those shown in Table 2. The table shows \nthat some manufacturers are close to their average target while others are way beyond. \n\nOf course, it should be recognised that manufacturers have the right to pool at will and to be \nmonitored as one entity for the purpose of meeting their targets. This may be necessary for \nsome of the top end manufacturers (like Porsche). In forming a pool, manufacturers must \nrespect the rules of competition law and the information that they exchange should be limited \nto average specific emissions of CO2, their specific emissions targets, and their total number of \nvehicles registered. In addition, independent manufacturers who sell fewer than 10,000 \nvehicles per year and who cannot or do not wish to join a pool can instead apply to the \nCommission for an individual target. Special purpose vehicles, such as vehicles built to \naccommodate wheelchair access, are excluded from the scope of the legislation. \n\n6 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n             \n\n \n   \n\n  \n   \n\n  \n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n \n\n              \n          \n\n               \n                 \n\n                \n              \n\n               \n           \n\n                 \n               \n\n              \n                \n\n               \n               \n\n               \n                \n\n               \n          \n\n               \n             \n\nTable 2: CO2 reductions required to meet 2015 and 2020 targets by manufacturer \n\nManufacturer \nCO2 reduction (g/km) CO2 reduction (g/km) \nin 2015 in 2020 \n\nPSA Peugeot-Citroen 16 51 \nRenault 20 55 \nFiat 22 57 \nHonda 25 59 \nToyota 25 60 \nGM 28 63 \nFord 30 66 \nVolkswagen 31 66 \nHyundai 32 67 \nNissan 38 73 \nSuzuki 41 75 \nMitsubishi 41 76 \nMazda 43 78 \nBMW 45 80 \nDaimlerChrysler 46 81 \nSubaru 81 117 \nPorsche 138 173 \n\nThe regulation does not specify the technology by which the CO2-average level should be \nreached (technology-neutral approach) by manufacturer, i.e. whether small, gasoline, diesel, \nhybrid, plug-in hybrids, electric or alternative fuel vehicles will be introduced, as long as the \naverage CO2 emission level is reached. It should also be made clear that the mean CO2 levels \nrefer to the certification test procedure (i.e. the New European Driving Cycle \u2013 NEDC to be \nused for emission measurement). However, the CO2 emission rate for each technology to be \nintroduced will depend on the actual driving pattern in real-world operation. It has to be \nexpected that different vehicle technologies will perform differently over real-world operation, \ndespite meeting the target of 95 g/km over the NEDC. For example, a hybrid gasoline vehicle is \na very good performer (low CO2) in urban driving through the frequent involvement of the \nelectric motor and the regeneration of braking energy back to the batteries. However, in \nhighway driving where the electric motor has only a secondary role to play and braking is \ninfrequent, a small diesel vehicle may actually be a better performer due to the higher \nefficiency of the diesel engine over the gasoline engine in the hybrid vehicle. Therefore, the \nNEDC value alone is not necessarily the only determinant of CO2 emissions of each technology \nin real-world driving. As a result, the mean CO2 emission of the stock in real-world conditions \nwill depend on the penetration rates of different new technologies, and the difference in CO2 \n\nemissions of each technology between real-world and type-approval driving conditions. \n\nThis study attempts a first assessment of the potential impact in CO2 emissions of the \nintroduction of new technologies at a different penetration rate.

Second, it simulates in different scenarios the penetration of these technologies in \nthe European stock, based on established projections of stock growth in Europe. \n\n2. Methodology \u2013 modelling \n\nFor the purposes of the present study, the CRUISE model, AVL\u2019s vehicle and powertrain level \nsimulation tool (https://www.avl.com/cruise1), was used to simulate vehicle engine operation \nover certain driving cycles. CRUISE is a vehicle simulator. In principle, a vehicle is graphically \nsetup, providing all kinds of powertrain details (wheel size, gearbox, differential, engine type, \netc.). Then an engine map is given, where the engine characteristics (be it consumption, \npollutants, noise, etc.) are provided as a function of the engine speed and power. Then the \nvehicle is allowed to operate over different speed profiles (driving cycles) and the software \nsimulates the vehicle and engine operation by which it can produce total fuel consumed and \ntotal emissions produced. The success in the simulation depends on the quality of input data \ndelivered both on the vehicle and engine fronts. \n\nFor this study, the main variables which were used as an input to the model were fuel \nconsumption engine maps, rated engine power, frontal area and aerodynamic drag, vehicle \nmass, rolling resistance coefficient(s), gear and final drive ratios, wheel diameter and \ndimensions and weight of various components. These data were retrieved from several \nsources such as measured coast down curves, measured engine maps, type approval data \n(VCA, 2010), literature (scientific papers, ordinary press, magazines, press releases) and \nspecialised websites. \n\nThe following approach was implemented: First, some typical gasoline and diesel cars from the \nEuropean stock were selected and converted through simulation to meet the 95 g/km target. \nThis means that \u2018conventional\u2019 technology vehicles of today were further refined to meet \nfuture emission targets. This is one path of achieving the 95 g/km requirement, i.e, by gradual \nimprovements on existing widespread technologies. The second approach was to simulate two \nadvanced technology vehicles which may achieve CO2 emissions already below the 95 g/km \nrequirement. Two vehicle technologies were selected towards this target, the first being the \nwell-known gasoline hybrid technology, where an electric motor is used to assist the engine \nduring acceleration and high load conditions. The second advanced technology has been an \nelectric car with a gasoline range extender. Such a configuration also consists by an internal \ncombustion engine and electric motor by the power to the wheels is only provided by the \nelectric motor. The engine is only used to power a generator that drives the electric motor. \n\nFigure 1 shows some typical \u2018advanced\u2019 vehicle technologies and their characteristics. The \npower is shown combined and separately for the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the \nelectric motor (EM). The tailpipe CO2 emissions are according to the manufacturer over the \ncertification test. The range is shown again combined and for vehicle operation only on the \nelectric mode (EV). This table only serves as an example to demonstrate the foreseeable \navailable technologies. Out of them we decided to model a full hybrid and an electric vehicle \nwith a range extender, as two vehicle representatives that can achieve low CO2 without \ncompromises in the performance or the range achieved. \n\n8 \n\nhttps://www.avl.com/cruise1\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n\u00a0   \n\n                 \n                 \n\n               \n               \n\n \n\n                \n                \n\n               \n                    \n\n               \n                  \n              \n               \n\n          \n\n             \n\n          \n        \n\n      \n       \n       \n\n      \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0\n\n      \n\nFigure 1: Typical \u2018advanced\u2019 vehicles and their characteristics\n\ufffd\n\n3. Vehicle configuration \n\nIn view of the 95 g/km target for 2020, four technologies are examined, which are expected to \nmeet or exceed this target. These include a small gasoline car, a small diesel car, a gasoline \nhybrid and an electric vehicle with range extender. Two different models from each of the \nformer two categories were selected for the purposes of this study, as described in the \nfollowing. \n\nTwo popular vehicle models, the Peugeot 107 1.0 and the Ford Ka 1.2 Duratec, were selected \nas representatives of the small gasoline car category. The Peugeot has one of the lowest CO2 \n\nemission value of conventional vehicles in the market today (108 g/km), while the Ford, mainly \ndue to its size, is some 30 g/km off the 2020 target. This is however a widespread vehicle in the \nEuropean stock. The two small diesel cars selected include the Smart fortwo cdi, which is \nalready below the 95 g/km limit, and the Fiat 500 1.3 MTJ, which is a typical small diesel \nvehicle with CO2 emissions close to the 2020 target. Key technical specifications for these \nvehicles are presented in Table 3. The type approval (TA) CO2 emissions reported by the \nmanufacturer for each vehicle are also included in the table. \n\nTable 3: Main technical data for the selected small gasoline and diesel cars \n\nInput parameter \nEmpty vehicle mass (kg) \nDrag coefficient\n\u00ad\nFrontal area (m2)\n\u00ad\nEngine capacity (l) \nGearbox \nFuel type\n\u00ad\n\nPeugeot 107 \n790 \n0.30 \n2.20 \n1.0 \nManual 5 gear \nGasoline\n\u00ad\n\nFord Ka \n940 \n0.34 \n2.11 \n1.2 \nManual 5 gear \nGasoline\n\u00ad\n\nSmart fortwo \n650 \n0.34 \n2.10 \n0.8 \nManual 5 gear \nDiesel\n\u00ad\n\nFiat 500 \n960 \n0.32 \n2.42 \n1.25 \nManual 5 gear \nDiesel\n\u00ad\n\n9 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n        \n        \n\n        \n\n \n\n               \n              \n                 \n\n             \n               \n\n              \n               \n\n                 \n                \n               \n\n                \n              \n\n                   \n               \n\n               \n                \n\n                \n        \n\n             \n\n                   \n                \n\n             \n                 \n\n     \n\n            \n\n      \n      \n\n    \n     \n     \n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n       \n       \n      \n\n       \n\nMax engine torque (Nm) 100 102 110 145\n\u00ad\n\nMax engine power (kW)\n\u00ad 50 51 45 55\n\u00ad\n\nTA CO2 emissions (g/km)\n\u00ad108 125 88 110 \n\nA full hybrid electric mid-size car (Toyota Prius) and an electric vehicle with range extender \n(Opel Ampera) were also selected. The CO2 emissions of the third generation Toyota Prius \n(2010 model year) are as low as 89 g/km, significantly reduced compared to the 104 g/km of \nthe previous (2nd) generation Pius. The Opel Ampera uses electricity (provided through the \ngrid) as its primary power source and gasoline as a secondary power source to generate \nelectricity through an internal combustion engine. In contrary to a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, \nthat use both the internal combustion engine and the electrical motor to directly power the \nwheels, an electric vehicle with a range extender is only propelled by the electric drive unit and \nthe engine is only used to power a generator and produce electricity to recharge the batteries. \nThis is why it is equipped with stronger electrical motor and larger batteries than hybrid \nvehicles. The Opel Ampera (expected in the European market at the beginning of 2011) will be \nthe first vehicle introducing this technology and, according to the manufacturer, will have a \nbattery range of 60 km. Within this range, it emits no tailpipe CO2, as it is practically driven as \nan electric vehicle. Key technical specifications for these two vehicles are presented in Table 4. \n\nTA CO2 emissions for the Opel Ampera are determined by the test procedure described in UNECE Regulation 101 (2005). According to this, two tests are carried out, one with a fully \ncharged battery and one with a battery in minimum state of charge. Weighted values of CO2 \n\nemissions are then calculated with the following formula: \n\nMHEV = (De \u00d7 M1 + Dav \u00d7 M2) / (De + Dav) \n\nWhere MHEV is the mass emission of CO2 (in g/km), M1 is the mass emission of CO2 (in g/km) \nwith a fully charged electrical energy/power storage device, M2 is the mass emission of CO2 (in \ng/km) with an electrical energy/power storage device in minimum state of charge (maximum \ndischarge of capacity), De is vehicle\u2019s electric range and Dav = 25 km is the assumed average \ndistance between two battery recharges). \n\nTable 4: Main technical data for the hybrid and the electric vehicle \n\nInput parameter \nEmpty vehicle mass (kg) \nDrag coefficient\n\u00ad\nFrontal area (m2)\n\u00ad\nEngine displacement (l) \nGearbox \nFuel type\n\u00ad\n\nMax engine torque (Nm)\n\u00ad\nMax engine power (kW)\n\u00ad\nMax electric motor torque (Nm)\n\u00ad\nMax electric motor power (kW) \nMax battery capacity (Ah) \nTA CO2 emissions (g/km) \n\nToyota Prius \n1379 \n0.25 \n2.61 \n1.8 \nAutomatic CVT \nGasoline \n142 \n73\n\u00ad\n\n207\n\u00ad\n\n60 \n6.5 \n89\n\u00ad\n\nOpel Ampera \nn.a. \nn.a. \nn.a. \n1.4 \nn.a. \nGasoline \n125 \n66\n\u00ad\n\n370\n\u00ad\n\n111\n\u00ad\n\n45\n\u00ad\n\n< 40\n\u00ad\n\n10 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0   \n\n                \n              \n\n             \n                \n\n               \n             \n               \n\n               \n             \n\n                \n               \n\n     \n\n               \n                \n\n                \n              \n\n                \n           \n\n    \n\n                \n             \n\n             \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0     \n\n\u00a0       \n\n\u00a0           \n\n\u00a0     \n\n\u00a0       \n\n             \n          \n\n              \n      \n\n                \n                   \n\n                \n                 \n\n              \n\n4.

To this aim, all input parameters collected related to vehicle, \nengine, transmission, wheel, electric motor and battery were introduced into the software. In \ncase any of these data were not available, CRUISE default values were used (e.g. the default \nvalues for the electric vehicle with range extender were used for simulating the Opel Ampera). \nSince the specific engine performance maps for these vehicles were not available, generic \nmaps from Euro 5 technology vehicles were used for the gasoline and the diesel engines \nrespectively. These were scaled to match the rated power of the two vehicles. Once the \nvehicles were set-up, the combined legislated driving cycle was simulated. The NEDC consists \nof an urban sub-cycle (Urban Driving Cycle \u2013 UDC) and an extra urban sub-cycle (Extra Urban \nDriving Cycle \u2013 EUDC). Where necessary, the engine maps were calibrated to match the fuel \nconsumption reported by each manufacturer. \n\nFor a correct calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the hybrid and the \nextended range electric vehicle, the battery\u2019s state of charge (SOC) at the end of the test \nshould be the same as in the beginning. Otherwise, the occurring difference (\u0394SOC) has to be \ndetermined and accounted for in the calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In \norder to correct \u0394SOC in CRUISE, multiple runs over the NEDC were performed to phase out \nthe SOC variations. These simulations showed that \u0394SOC affected significantly fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions. \n\nAs a second step, various options to reduce fuel consumption and thus achieve the 95 g/km \ntarget were examined for the conventional technologies, i.e. small gasoline and diesel vehicles. \nThe influence of the following parameters has been investigated by the model simulations: \n\n\u2013 Vehicle weight \n\n\u2013 Engine power \n\n\u2013 Drag coefficient \n\n\u2013 Frontal area \n\n\u2013 Rolling resistance \n\n\u2013 Inertia of rotating masses \n\n\u2013 Type of gear box (automatic, manual) \n\n\u2013 Number of gears and transmission ratio of gears and axis \n\n\u2013 Energy consumption of auxiliaries \n\n\u2013 Start stop function of the engine \n\nFrom the above parameters, those with the greater influence on fuel consumption were \nselected. These include vehicle weight, aerodynamics, transmission, rolling resistance and \nengine efficiency. The range by which these parameters were varied depends on the market \ninformation of the respective vehicle category. \n\nAs an example, the fuel consumption of the Ford Ka needs to be improved significantly in \norder to achieve a 30 g/km CO2 reduction. Based on the technical data shown in Table 3 as well \nas technical data from other competitive cars, it is evident that vehicle weight reduction will be \none of the first options for the manufacturer. On the other hand, though having a high CO2 \n\nreduction potential, it is envisaged that the manufacturers will not opt for reducing engine \n\n11 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                \n           \n\n       \n\n              \n             \n\n            \n    \n\n               \n            \n\n             \n                    \n\n               \n               \n\n                \n               \n\n            \n\n               \n       \n\n        \n            \n\n           \n        \n\n         \n        \n          \n\n            \n\n                   \n                \n\n            \n         \n\n\u00a0    \n\n             \n             \n\n             \n            \n\n             \n             \n\n            \n              \n\n             \n                \n\npower. This is based on observations of the market trend over the last years, where vehicles \nhave become more efficient without reducing engine power. Therefore, only marginal \nreductions should be expected, if really necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, advanced engine technologies such as variable valve timing and lift, \nturbocharging, direct fuel injection, and cylinder deactivation can be used to reduce engine \nlosses and thus increase engine efficiency. However, the margin for such technological \nimprovements is rather limited. \n\nThe options assumed for the simulations are mainly lower vehicle weight, air drag and rolling \nresistance improvements, more dense gearbox ratios and, and secondarily lower engine power \nand improved engine efficiency. From the vehicles described above, both small gasoline cars \nand one small diesel car will need to cut their CO2 emissions in view of the 95 g/km target. The \nassumed changes for these three vehicles to achieve the 2020 target are summarised in Table \n5. The other three vehicles already comply with the emission standard and thus no further \nchanges are assumed here, although it is possible that their CO2 emission level will be reduced \neven further in view of the 2020 targets. The resulting reductions in type approval CO2 \n\nemissions as calculated with CRUISE are also included in the same table. \n\nTable 5:\t\ufffd Assumed changes in vehicle specifications of the two small gasoline cars and one \nsmall diesel car and calculated CO2 reductions \n\nInput parameter Peugeot 107 Ford Ka Fiat 500 \nEmpty vehicle mass - 10 % - 25 % - 10 % \nDrag coefficient - 10 % - 20 % - 20 % \nEngine power 0 % 0 % 0 % \nGear ratios 0 % + 15 % 0 % \nRolling resistance 0 % 0 % 0 % \nEngine efficiency +5 % + 5 % + 5 % \nTA CO2 emissions - 11 % - 22 % - 11 % \n\nIt should be noted that the values assumed in Table 5 are not the only options, but they just \npresent an example of how the 95 g/km target can be reached, based on observed current \ntrends and expected future developments. Several other options exist; identifying all these \noptions is however outside the scope of this study. \n\n5. Real-world emission performance \n\nIn order to determine fuel consumption of the above selected vehicles under real-world \ndriving conditions, and not only under type approval, the Artemis driving cycles were \nintroduced in CRUISE. These were developed in the framework of a large-scale scientific \nprogramme (Assessment and Reliability of Transport Emission Models and Inventory Systems \u2013 \nARTEMIS), funded by the European Commission and aiming at the development of a \nharmonised emission model. The Artemis cycles are distinguished into three driving cycles that \nsimulate different road operating conditions: An urban cycle (Artemis Urban) resembling urban \ndriving conditions, a semi-urban cycle (Artemis Road) simulating the operation of the vehicle in \na regular medium-speed road, and an extra urban cycle (Artemis Motorway) simulating the \noperation in a high-speed road (Andr\u00e9, 2004). The three Artemis cycles can be further split into \n\n12 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n             \n              \n\n \n\n           \n\n               \n                \n              \n\n              \n                \n\n                \n            \n\n              \n\n                 \n    \n\n      \n     \n\n     \n     \n     \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\nsub-cycles, i.e. Artemis Urban (1-5), Artemis Road (1-5) and Artemis Motorway (1-4). The \nspeed profile of the Artemis cycles and the NEDC are presented in Figure 2. \n\nFigure 2: The type approval (NEDC) and the Artemis driving cycles \n\nThe simulated CO2 emissions of the above vehicles over the NEDC and Artemis driving cycles \nare presented in the following tables. Emissions of the vehicles as they are presently and with \nthe assumed changes in view of the 2020 target are included in the tables. \n\nTable 6 summarises the simulated CO2 emissions for the two small gasoline vehicles. The \nresults show that the two vehicles are expected to have similar performance in terms of fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions in 2020 (differences below 5 %), which is largely due to the \nsimilar technical characteristics of the two vehicles after the changes introduced. Real-world \nemissions are higher by 11 to 17 % on average compared to type approval. \n\nTable 6: Simulated CO2 emissions (in g/km) of the two small gasoline cars over the NEDC and \nthe Artemis driving cycles \n\nDriving cycle \nYear \n\nUDC \nEUDC \nNEDC \nArtemis urban \nArtemis road \nArtemis motorway \nArtemis (all) \n\nPeugeot 107 \n2010 \n143.4 \n89.3 \n109.0 \n168.6 \n101.3 \n126.9 \n122.7 \n\n2020 \n132.8 \n79.6 \n97.0 \n154.7 \n90.7 \n111.4 \n110.4 \n\nFord Ka \n2010 \n163.2 \n102.4 \n124.8 \n193.3 \n119.9 \n145.5 \n143.7 \n\n2020 \n137.1 \n77.7 \n97.5 \n160.1 \n90.9 \n107.2 \n108.6 \n\n13 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n                \n                  \n\n               \n                 \n              \n\n           \n\n                  \n   \n\n      \n     \n\n     \n     \n     \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n \n\n              \n               \n\n                \n                  \n\n               \n                 \n\n            \n\n              \n                 \n\n                 \n                  \n\n                \n            \n\n              \n               \n\n     \n\n                \n        \n\n      \n   \n\n   \n   \n\nThe simulation results for the two small diesel vehicles are summarised in Table 7. The Smart, \ncompared to the Fiat, has lower CO2 emissions ranging from 20-30 % in the low and high speed \nrange (average speeds below 30 and above 90 km/h) to 5-20 % for intermediate average \nspeeds. Similarly to the small gasoline cars, real-world emissions are higher by 10 to 15 % on \naverage compared to type approval. The difference is considerably larger for urban cycles (by \nabout 25-30 %) than for extra-urban conditions (up to 10 %). \n\nTable 7:\t\ufffd Simulated CO2 emissions (in g/km) of the two small diesel cars over the NEDC and the \nArtemis driving cycles \n\nDriving cycle Smart Fortwo Fiat 500 \nYear 2010 2020 2010 2020 \n\nUDC 110.1 110.1 119.0 116.4 \nEUDC 81.3 81.3 100.4 85.2 \nNEDC 89.1 89.1 108.8 96.5 \nArtemis urban 141.6 141.6 163.3 144.2 \nArtemis road 76.0 76.0 119.0 94.9 \nArtemis motorway 104.9 104.9 134.2 107.2 \nArtemis (all) 97.0 97.0 131.1 111.4 \n\nTable 8 summarises the simulation results for the hybrid and the extended range electric \nvehicle. The hybrid vehicle has particularly low CO2 emissions over the hot UDC (74.5 g/km), \ndue to the electrical operation. However, the type approval is by definition a cold cycle and \nthus the CO2 emissions over the urban part are increased by about 38 % due to the continuous \noperation of the ICE in order to heat-up the catalyst. Real-world emissions in urban conditions \nare in-between these two values, i.e. higher than hot UDC and lower than cold UDC by about \n20 %, while they are on the same level for extra-urban cycles. \n\nAs mentioned previously, no tailpipe CO2 is emitted from the extended range electric vehicle \nwithin the battery range and hence the zero values in the table for most driving cycles. When \nrunning the Artemis cycles the internal combustion engine is only used for a small part of the \nmotorway cycle (in the last 5 km) to drive the electric generator. The CO2 emissions for the full \nArtemis cycles is lower compared to the Motorway cycle as the same amount of CO2 emissions \nare divided by a larger distance travelled (50.8 vs 28.7 km respectively). \n\nAs mentioned previously, these vehicles already meet the 2020 emission target and thus no \nfurther reductions are assumed here, although it is possible that their CO2 emission level will \nbe further reduced by 2020. \n\nTable 8:\t\ufffd Simulated CO2 emissions (in g/km) of the hybrid and the extended range electric car \nover the NEDC and the Artemis driving cycles\n\ufffd\n\nDriving cycle \nUDC \nEUDC \nNEDC \n\nToyota Prius \n103.0 \n78.9 \n89.9 \n\nOpel Ampera \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n14 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n \n\n\u00a0    \n\n               \n                \n\n               \n                \n\n               \n              \n\n                \n              \n\n               \n                 \n\n            \n               \n\n                \n     \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n              \n\n                \n               \n               \n\n               \n\nArtemis urban\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis road\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis motorway \nArtemis (all) \n\n89.9 \n72.3 \n105.2 \n81.1 \n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n20.9 \n11.8 \n\n6. COPERT-type emission functions\n\u00ad\n\nIn order to assess the real-world performance of the above vehicles in 2020, their CO2 \n\nemissions as a function of average vehicle speed are presented in Figure 3. As expected, fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions are higher at lower average speeds, they reach a minimum at \naround 50 to 80 km/h and they increase again for higher average speeds. In general, gasoline \ncars have higher CO2 emission levels compared to diesel cars, due to the lower overall \nefficiency. Gasoline hybrids perform very well in urban conditions, as they are powered mainly \nby the electric motor. On the other hand, in highway driving that the vehicle is operated \nmainly by the thermal engine, CO2 emissions are marginally lower than small diesel cars. \n\nThe emission curves clearly show that for vehicles with an internal combustion engine, there is \na narrow \u201cspeed window\u201d where the CO2 emission level is below or close to the 95 g/km \ntarget. Outside of this window, the CO2 emissions increase considerably. Another interesting \nobservation is that for very low average speeds, such as in urban environments with heavy \ntraffic and congested roads, the CO2 emissions may increase dramatically by a factor of up to \nthree for all vehicle technologies. \n\n0 \n\n50 \n\n100 \n\n150 \n\n200 \n\n250 \n\n300 \n\n350 \n\nCO\n2 \n\nem\nis\n\nsi\non\n\n fa\nct\n\nor\n (g\n\n/k\nm\n\n) \n\nSmall Gasoline \nSmall Diesel \nHEV \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 \n\nAverage speed (km/h) \n\nFigure 3: CO2 emission results of the various technologies as function of average speed \n\nFrom the values of Table 8 it is evident that the above definition of speed-dependent emission \nfactors is not appropriate for the electric vehicles with range extender. This is because the \ninternal combustion engine operates in a steady-state rather than in transient mode as in the \ncase of a conventional vehicle. As a result, the tailpipe CO2 emissions may vary substantially \n\n15 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n              \n \n\n                \n               \n\n               \n               \n\n                \n              \n\n \n\n             \n             \n\n \n  \n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n     \n     \n     \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n \n\n                \n                  \n                 \n                \n\n                 \n                \n\n             \n  \n\nover driving cycles with the same average speed and same dynamics but different distances \ncovered. \n\nTherefore, the expression of emissions as function of the total trip length is proposed to be \nused instead. To this aim a set of additional simulations were performed to calculate energy \nconsumption and CO2 emissions over longer trips for the range extender vehicle. A simple and \nstraightforward way is by adding additional Artemis Motorway cycles to the existing full set of \nArtemis cycles. This is a sensible assumption since longer trips (above 50 km) will be most \nprobably run in highway conditions. The results of these simulations are summarised in Table \n9. \n\nTable 9:\t\ufffd Simulated CO2 emissions and overall energy consumption of the extended range \nelectric car over the NEDC and various combinations of the Artemis driving cycles \n\nUDC\n\u00ad\n\nEUDC\n\u00ad\n\nNEDC\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis Urban\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis Road\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis Motorway \nAll Artemis \nAll Artemis + 1 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 2 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 3 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 4 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 5 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nTrip length \n(km) \n\n10.94 \n3.98 \n6.96 \n4.87 \n17.27 \n28.7 \n50.9 \n79.6 \n108.3 \n137.0 \n165.7 \n194.5\n\u00ad\n\nCO2 emission \nfactor (g/km) \n\n0 \n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0 \n11.8 \n51.1 \n69.6 \n80.3 \n87.4 \n92.3\n\u00ad\n\nEnergy consum. \n(kWh/km) \n\n0.107 \n0.138 \n0.126 \n0.140 \n0.128 \n0.164 \n0.150 \n0.095 \n0.070 \n0.055 \n0.046 \n0.039\n\u00ad\n\nIt should be noted that the above driving cycles were simulated with a battery fully charged \nand can be thus considered as individual trips.

Scenario design \n\nIn order to demonstrate how the same new-stock average CO2 target may be reached with \ndifferent effects on real-world emissions, three scenarios for the penetration of the above \ntechnologies in the European vehicle stock were designed. It should be made clear that the \nscenarios are only means to demonstrate the sensitivity of real-world CO2 emissions to engine \ntechnology and by no way they dictate a particular path that has to be followed to reach a \ntarget. \n\nThe options to meet the future target of 95 g/km (tailpipe only) include shift of new vehicles to \nsmaller cars and penetration of hybrid and electric vehicles. Full electric vehicles may be \nintroduced but it is still considered that their numbers will be relatively small to have a \nsubstantial impact on mean CO2 emissions. Plug-in hybrids are the other option for an \nadvanced technology. However, it is considered that their performance is similar to the electric \nwith a range extender so they were not introduced not to unnecessarily complicate the \ncalculations. Between the four available technologies, downsized gasoline, downsized diesel, \nhybrid and electric with range extender, any mix is considered possible as long as the average \nCO2 target of the new registrations is met. \n\nIn order to demonstrate the real-world effect on CO2 emissions of the various scenarios, the \nexample of the German passenger car fleet has been selected. To this aim, projections of stock \ngrowth in Germany delivered by the EC4MACS project2 (an EU-LIFE funded program) were \nused as the basecase. Germany was selected as a country with a fast stock replacement, such \nas that targets for new registration vehicles would be immediate reflected to the total stock as \nwell. \n\nBased on these projections, total numbers of new registrations for the main passenger car \ncategories are summarised in Table 12 regarding the period 2015 to 2020. \n\n2 EC4MACS (www.ec4macs.eu) is a LIFE+ project which provides the modelling framework for integrated \nassessment of air emission policies in Europe. The project has developed detailed projections of activity, \nenergy consumption and air emissions for all European Member States, based on the PRIMES 2010 \nbaseline scenario. The data used to develop the scenarios in this project originate from the road \ntransport projections within EC4MACS. \n\n18 \n\nhttp:www.ec4macs.eu\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n         \n\n        \n\n              \n\n                    \n\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n\n       \n\n \n\n            \n             \n\n                  \n                \n               \n\n \n\n             \n            \n\n               \n               \n\n               \n                 \n\n                \n\n            \n                  \n\n                \n              \n\n                       \n     \n\n             \n              \n\n                  \n                  \n\n           \n\n        \n\n   \n\n         \n\n         \n\n          \n\n          \n\nTable 12: New registrations of passenger cars \u2013 Basecase\n\ufffd\n\nVehicle type \n\nSmall Gasoline \n\nMedium Gasoline \n\nLarge Gasoline \n\nSmall Diesel \n\nLarge Diesel \n\nHybrid Diesel \n\nHybrid Gasoline \n\nE-REV \n\n2015 \n\n853 102 \n\n1 272 288 \n\n297 470 \n\n856 448 \n\n481 721 \n\n299 652 \n\n348 603 \n\n0 \n\n2016 \n\n900 855 \n\n1 291 960 \n\n317 847 \n\n792 277 \n\n446 204 \n\n228 306 \n\n265 181 \n\n0 \n\n2017 \n\n915 044 \n\n1 281 772 \n\n327 100 \n\n813 226 \n\n453 463 \n\n239 640 \n\n286 699 \n\n0 \n\n2018 \n\n917 766 \n\n1 268 857 \n\n330 653 \n\n830 365 \n\n459 552 \n\n251 694 \n\n308 949 \n\n0 \n\n2019 \n\n914 102 \n\n1 255 702 \n\n330 560 \n\n844 089 \n\n464 770 \n\n264 339 \n\n331 453 \n\n0 \n\n2020 \n\n907 374 \n\n1 243 982 \n\n328 580 \n\n854 938 \n\n469 352 \n\n277 451 \n\n353 794 \n\n0 \n\nIn total, three scenarios were considered, assuming different penetration rates for small, \nhybrid and electric vehicles. In all scenarios, the new technologies are substituting medium \nand big cars, i.e. those with an engine capacity above 1.4 litres for gasoline and above 2.0 litres \nfor diesel cars. The three scenarios were designed as a response to three main directions that \nare taking place in the effort to reduce CO2 emissions. These are downsizing, hybridization, and \nelectrification. \n\nThe assumed changes in new registrations, which are introduced gradually over the period \n2015 to 2020, are summarised in Table 13 for the various scenarios. \n\nScenario 1 (downsizing) assumes a shift towards small vehicles at the expense of bigger cars. \nAccording to this scenario, 70 % of medium-size gasoline cars are substituted by small ones, \nwhereas large gasoline and diesel cars are completely phased-out by 2020. In order to achieve \nthe 2020 target, 6 % of hybrids are substituted by electric vehicles. This results in the vehicle \nmarket being dominated by small cars with a 77 % share in new registrations in 2020. \n\nScenario 2 (hybridization) assumes an aggressive penetration of hybrid vehicles. According to \nthis scenario, 50 % of medium-size gasoline cars and 80 % of large gasoline and diesel cars are \nsubstituted by hybrid gasoline and diesel cars respectively by 2020. Again, 6 % of the basecase \nhybrids are substituted by electric vehicles. As a result, the penetration of hybrid vehicles \nincreases from 15 to 42 % from 2015 to 2020, whereas it is in the order of 13 to 15 % in the \nbasecase over the same period. \n\nScenario 3 (electrification) assumes an aggressive penetration of electric vehicles with a range \nextender. Compared to the previous scenarios, a smaller fraction of medium and large cars \n(20 % of medium-size gasoline cars and 30 % of large gasoline and diesel cars) is substituted by \nelectric vehicles.

CO2 emissions calculations \n\nFor the calculation of CO2 emissions, average speeds of 20, 50 and 90 km/h were assumed for \nurban, rural and highway driving. Data for the annual mileage of each vehicle category were \nalso taken from EC4MACS and values of 40, 30 and 30 % were assumed for the share of annual \nmileage driven in urban, rural and highway conditions respectively. The calculation is sensitive \nto the speed and share at each driving mode so final values may vary according to the \nconditions selected. This can be revealed with a sensitivity analysis but this was not attempted \nin this report, again in order not to introduce too many uncertainties in the calculation. \nHowever, it is highly recommended that the effect of different vehicle operation conditions \naccording to their technology on total CO2 emissions is investigated. To make it more clear, it \ncould be expected that an electric vehicle (even equipped with a range extender) will be used \n\n21 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                 \n           \n\n      \n\n                 \n            \n\n             \n                   \n\n            \n              \n\n                  \n    \n\n                 \n               \n\n              \n                  \n\n    \n\n                \n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n       \n\n \n\n            \n                 \n\n             \n          \n\nat shorter trips (e.g. urban trips) than the diesel counterpart in order for the owner to be \nbenefitted from the electrical operation. Therefore, real-world operation may be differently \ndefined according to the vehicle type. \n\nIn any case, it was decided at this stage to keep the same vehicle behaviour regardless of \ntechnology. Therefore, the activity data selected were then combined with the real-world \nemission functions developed in section 6 for each technology, to calculate CO2 emission \nfactors for the year 2020 as shown in Table 15. For previous years a yearly decrease of 2% in \nfuel efficiency was assumed. This reflects the typical year-to-year efficiency improvement of \npassenger cars recorded by the monitoring procedure (mean CO2 dropped from 172 g/km in \n2000 to 146 g/km in 2009, i.e. with a rate of 1.8% per year). These emission factors are \ncommon for all scenarios. \n\nFor the electric vehicle with a range extender it was assumed that urban trips are within their \nelectric range and thus no tailpipe CO2 is emitted. For rural and highway conditions average \ntrip lengths of 100 and 200 km respectively were assumed. CO2 emission factors corresponding \nto these average trip values were then selected from Table 9, i.e. 69.6 and 92.3 g/km for rural \nand highway driving respectively. \n\nTable 15: Real-world CO2 emission factors (in g/km) for new vehicles per vehicle class and year \nused in the calculations \n\nVehicle type 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 \n\nSmall Gasoline 140.8 138.1 135.4 132.7 130.1 127.6 \n\nMedium Gasoline 163.1 159.9 156.8 153.7 150.7 147.7 \n\nLarge Gasoline 207.6 203.5 199.5 195.6 191.8 188.0 \n\nSmall Diesel 125.0 122.5 120.1 117.8 115.4 113.2 \n\nLarge Diesel 144.7 141.9 139.1 136.4 133.7 131.1 \n\nHybrid Gasoline 87.2 85.5 83.8 82.1 80.5 79.0 \n\nE-REV 54.0 52.9 51.9 50.9 49.9 48.9 \n\nBased on the assumptions and simulations presented above, the expected development in \nreal-world CO2 emission factors from 2010 to 2020 is graphically shown in Figure 6 for each of \nthe technologies considered in the present study.

The basecase calculation follows the assumptions \non efficiency improvement of the PRIMES 2009 baseline scenario. These are not necessarily as \ndetailed as the calculations that we have performed in this report. In addition, the basecase \ncalculation does not include the detailed real-world efficiency factors developed for hybrid and \nelectric vehicles. Therefore, absolute differences over the basecase are not important, as the \nbasecase is artificial as well. However, differences between the different scenarios are most \nimportant to study. All three scenarios predict a reduction in emissions, which is highest for \nthe hybridization scenario and lowest for the electrification scenario, whereas the downsizing \nscenario is in-between. Marginal differences may be observed for 2015 as there are only slight \ndifferences in the composition of the fleet among the basecase and the various scenarios. \n\nAlthough electric vehicles have the best performance (both in type-approval and real-world \nCO2 emissions) of all vehicle technologies considered in this study, new cars CO2 emissions in \nthe electrification scenario are only 6.5 % lower compared to basecase in 2020. This is due to \nthe fact that, compared to other scenarios, only a small fraction of the fleet has been \nsubstituted by electric vehicles (20 % of medium and 30 % of large cars), minimising thus many \nof their emission benefits. On the other hand, a considerable fraction of new registrations \n(50 % of medium and 80 % of large cars, i.e. the least energy-efficient types) is replaced by \nhybrids in the hybridization scenario, resulting in a 16.5 % decrease in CO2 emissions. This fleet \nreplacement is even larger in the downsizing scenario (70 % of medium cars replaced by small \nones, whereas large cars are completely phased-out in 2020), but this is counterbalanced by \nthe fact that small gasoline and diesel cars are less energy-efficient than hybrids. \n\nWhen considering the total CO2 emissions of the entire passenger cars fleet (i.e. not only new \nregistrations) a similar picture may be observed as shown in Figure 8. As expected, basecase \nCO2 emissions are reducing as a result of fleet renewal and penetration of new technologies \nwith improved fuel efficiency (Euro 6). \n\n75 000 \n\n80 000 \n\n85 000 \n\n90 000 \n\n95 000 \n\n100 000 \n\nTo\nta\n\nl C\nO\n\n2 \nem\n\nis\nsi\n\non\ns \n\n(k\nt)\n\n \n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 \n\nBasecase Downsizing Hybridization Electrification 95 g/km \n\nFigure 8: Development of total CO2 emissions (tailpipe only) from the passenger car fleet for \nthe various scenarios compared to basecase \n\n24 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n               \n              \n\n              \n           \n\n \n\n            \n                \n\n              \n              \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n              \n        \n\n \n\n\u00a0    \n\n               \n               \n              \n\n              \n                 \n                \n\n              \n             \n\n               \n     \n\nHowever, this reduction is much lower compared to the 95 g/km CO2 emission target specified \nin Regulation No. 443/2009 for new passenger cars.

Discussion and Conclusions \n\nCO2 emissions from passenger cars in Europe are gradually decreasing in an effort to reduce \nthe impact of road transport on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. The main tool \nthat the European Union has introduced to improve CO2 emissions from passenger cars is \nRegulation 443/2009 that stipulates that passenger cars to be first time registered in 2020 \nneed to emit 95 g/km CO2 at an average over the certification test. The regulation does not \ninfer into the technologies that need to be introduced to achieve this neither it addresses the \nimpact that real-world vehicle operation may have on actual CO2 emissions, compared to the \ncertification test. Therefore, how actual CO2 emissions will evolve and how effective this \nRegulation will be in controlling real-world CO2 emissions are important issues that will have to \nbe revealed into the future. \n\n25 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n               \n               \n\n            \n            \n\n      \n\n\u00a0             \n               \n\n             \n             \n\n     \n\u00a0             \n\n             \n             \n\n               \n          \n\n\u00a0            \n                \n\n             \n              \n\n             \n             \n\n              \n\n                 \n     \n\n            \n           \n\n              \n       \n\n              \n          \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n             \n\n\u00a0           \n            \n\n               \n \n\n\u00a0            \n              \n\n              \n            \n\n            \n   \n\nIn order to provide some preliminary response to such a question, we performed a simulation \nstudy by projecting CO2 emissions of passenger cars into the future. The projection was made \nwith three alternative scenarios, trying to capture possible options of vehicle technology \nimplementations into the future. The scenarios reflected three main directions that are \ncurrently pursued to reduce CO2 emissions: \n\n\u00ad Downsizing: Scenario 1 assumed that new registrations of vehicles are shifted from \nlarger to smaller cars. This is a tendency which is even today obvious, with all \nmainstream manufacturers extending the range of smaller cars offered (i.e. below 1.4 l \nengine capacity). Downsizing reduces emissions as a result of less energy required to \noperate small and lighter vehicles. \n\n\u00ad Hybridization: Scenario 2 introduced a large number of gasoline hybrid vehicles. Hybrid \nvehicles benefit from the combined operation of an internal combustion engine and an \nelectric motor which assists the engine over accelerations and high load conditions. As \na result, a smaller engine than in a conventional vehicle may be used which operates \nunder less transient conditions. This results to higher overall efficiency \n\n\u00ad Electrification: Scenario 3 considered the introduction of electric vehicles, i.e. vehicles \nwhere power to the wheels is delivered by an electric motor and which can be charged \ndirectly from the power grid. An electric vehicle with range extender was considered \nas the best example, i.e. a vehicle where an internal combustion engine charges the \nbatteries when depleted. This differs from hybrid because power to the wheels is \nprovided only through the electric motor. However, such an electric vehicle is not \ncompromised by a small range. Therefore, it appears as the best of both worlds. \n\nIn all scenarios, the mix of technologies was such as to achieve 95 g/km average CO2 emissions \nof new registrations in 2020. \n\nThe different vehicle technologies were simulated using an appropriate vehicle model and \ntheir CO2 emissions were determined over both type-approval and real-world driving \nconditions. Emission factors were developed in this way. These emission factors were used to \ncalculate CO2 emissions over real-world driving conditions. \n\nThe three scenarios developed were compared against a basecase scenario. This is also an \nartificial scenario, based on the EC4MACS efficiency improvements considered for passenger \ncars. \n\nThe main conclusions from this work can be summarised in the following points: \n\n\u00ad The actual real-world emission factors of improved future technologies of \nconventional diesel and gasoline passenger cars are higher than the certification test \nof 95 g/km. The difference for gasoline cars is +12\u00b11% cars and +10\u00b11.2% for diesel \ncars. \n\n\u00ad Advanced vehicle technologies (hybrid and electric with range extender) may achieve \nreal-world CO2 emissions which are already much lower than the 95 g/km target. In \nparticular for the electric vehicle, this depends a lot on the mean trip distance \ntravelled. Starting with fully charged batteries, the 95 g/km target is achieved \napproximately after 170 km and the emission asymptotically reaches 120 g/km for \nlonger trip distances. \n\n26 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0              \n               \n\n        \n\u00a0              \n\n           \n             \n\n           \n\u00a0              \n\n              \n         \n\n\u00a0           \n\u00a0             \n\n          \n           \n\n             \n             \n\n            \n\u00a0            \n\n            \n               \n\n              \n       \n\n\u00a0             \n       \n\n\u00a0              \n            \n\n            \n          \n\n         \n\n\u00a0               \n             \n\n               \n           \n\n\u00a0                 \n             \n           \n\n        \n\n                \n            \n\n              \n             \n\n           \n               \n\n          \n\n              \n             \n\n\u00ad Because of their unique characteristics, the mix of technologies to be introduced does \nhave an impact on real-world CO2 emissions, even if one considers a fixed new stock \naverage CO2 of 95 g/km in 2020. \n\n\u00ad The scenario mostly based on downsizing achieves 12 % CO2 reductions over the \nbasecase, the hybridization scenario achieves 17 % reduction and the electrification \nscenario achieves 7 % reduction. For comparison, if the real-world CO2 emission factor \nwas 95 g/km, the actual reduction would have been 18 %. \n\n\u00ad For the German passenger car stock, the difference of Scenario 3 (electrification) over \nScenario 2 (hybridization) is 12.7 % higher CO2 emissions of new passenger cars in \n2020, while both scenarios meet the 95 g/km target. \n\n\u00ad\t The sometimes counter-intuitive conclusions are based on the following effects: \no\t Introduction of an electric vehicle with very high CO2 reductions provides the \n\nmargin to introduce heavier vehicles with high CO2 emissions. Therefore, \nintroduction of electric vehicles leads to lower real-world CO2 reductions than \nany of the other three scenarios. It should be recognized that this conclusions \ngreatly depend on how electric vehicles are used. If electric vehicles are only \nused for short urban trips then actual CO2 reductions will be higher. \n\no\t Hybridization achieves the best overall result because hybrid vehicles seem to \nperform very well under all driving conditions. By having a certification CO2 \n\nvalues close to the target, they do not allow the introduction of heavy cars if \nthe target is to be met. This safeguards that the certification CO2 value holds \ntrue for most of the real-world conditions. \n\no\t Downsizing is also a good option. However, small vehicles still behave worse \nthan hybrids under certain conditions (urban driving). \n\n\u00ad\t The benefit of introducing electric vehicles to meet the CO2 target is further \ncompromised if one considers the upstream CO2 emitted for electricity production. By \ntaking the average European carbon intensity into account, the benefits of the \nelectrification diminish, reaching only 1.6 % over the base case. \n\nThe impacts of these results are at least two-fold: \n\n1.\t\u00ad The actual effect of regulation 443/2009 strongly depends on the technology mix to be \nintroduced. Between the best and the worst scenario developed, the difference in CO2 \n\nemissions of new passenger cars is approximately 13%. In other words, it is like having \na target of 107 g/km instead of 95 g/km in 2020. \n\n2.\t\u00ad Electric vehicles can be the most efficient in terms of CO2. Because of this, they leave \nroom for CO2 inefficient vehicles to survive. As CO2 emissions of inefficient vehicles \ndiffer significantly between real-world and type-approval, the net effect of electric \nvehicles can be negative compared to alternative scenarios. \n\nOne needs to recognise that this has been only an exploratory study trying to identify possible \nside-impacts of regulation 443/2009. In this direction, the scenarios developed and the \ntechnology mix considered per scenario are plausible but not the only possibilities. In addition, \na number of issues may require additional attention. For example, real-world conditions may \ndiffer according to vehicle types and characteristics. Similarly, technology of \u2018conventional\u2019 \nvehicles may evolve in a direction not foreseen in this analysis (e.g. brake energy recuperation, \nmore efficient start and stop systems, new engine concepts, etc.). \n\nStill, despite these limitations, our analysis demonstrates that there are possible ways to meet \nthe regulation requirements into the future while greatly deviate in real-world CO2 emissions. \n\n27 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                \n           \n\n \n\n\u00a0  \n\n             \n       \n\n             \n          \n\n           \n           \n\n \n\n              \n          \n\n              \n \n\n              \n \n\nThis requires some further attention in order to avoid a situation where the letter of the \nregulation is met but the target (actual CO2 reduction) is not. \n\n10.

The objective of this task is to project the mean CO2 emissions of the European passenger \ncars stock in real\u00adworld conditions to 2020, assuming different scenarios towards reaching the target \nof 95 g/km as an average of new car registrations. To this aim, a simulation exercise divided in two \nsteps has been implemented. First, we have simulated the expected CO2 emissions of forthcoming \nvehicle technologies in type\u00adapproval and real\u00adworld conditions. Second, we have simulated different \npenetration rates of these technologies in the European stock, based on established projections of \nstock growth in Europe. The study demonstrates that reaching an new registration average of \n95 g/km may lead to different CO2 emissions in the real world, depending on the mix of technologies \nconsidered to meet the type\u00adapproval target. \n\nKeywords \n\nCO2 emissions, passenger cars, hybrids, electric vehicles with range extender \n\nInternet reference \n\nVersion / Date \n\nFinal Version / 04 February 2011 \n\nClassification statement \n\nPUBLIC \n\nNo of Pages \n\n28 \n\nPrice \n\nFREE \n\nDeclassification date Bibliography \n\nYES \n\n3 \n\nhttp://lat.eng.auth.gr/\f\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0    \u00a0\n\n\u00a0    \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0    \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0     \u00a0\n\n\u00a0   \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nContents\n\u00ad\n\n.

Introduction \u2013 Objectives \n\nThe voluntary agreement of the European Commission with the automotive industry \n(Commission Recommendation 1999/125/EC) was the first attempt of the European Union to \nset CO2 emission targets for new passenger cars. In this process, although significant emission \nreductions were achieved by the vehicle manufacturers in view of the 140 g/km target by \n2008/09, it was not made eventually possible to reach the reductions proposed in this \nvoluntary agreement. \n\nAs a result, the European Parliament and the Council issued Regulation No. 443/2009 \nintroducing mandatory CO2 emissions limits for new passenger cars. The regulation specifies \nthat each vehicle manufacturer must achieve a fleet-average CO2 emission target of 130 g/km \nby 2015 for all new cars registered in the EU. In order to meet the CO2 emission target of \n120 g/km, a further reduction of 10 g/km is to be provided by additional measures, such as the \nuse of biofuels. According to the regulation, a so-called limit value curve sets specific emissions \ntargets for each manufacturer based on the average vehicle mass sold by the particular \nmanufacturer. The formula to calculate the limit value curve is: \n\nPermitted specific emissions of CO2 = 130 + a \u00d7 (M \u2013 M0) \n\nWhere M is the reference vehicle mass (in kg), M0 = 1289 kg is a mass constant and a = 0.0457. \nThis is an empirical curve which has been developed in order not to distort the market, taking \ninto account the different market segments of various vehicle manufacturers. That curve is set \nin such a way that heavier cars will have to improve more than lighter cars compared to today, \nbut that manufacturers will still be able to make cars with emissions above the limit value \ncurve provided these are balanced by cars which are below the curve. \n\nThe regulation also defines a long-term target of 95 g/km to be reached by 2020. From 2016 \nonwards, the value of M0 will be annually adjusted to reflect the average mass of passenger \ncars in the previous three calendar years. \n\nManufacturers' progress will be monitored each year by the Member States on the basis of \nnew car registration data. To this aim, it is important that the manufacturer is clearly identified \nand distinguished from the make1. Table 1 below shows the actual position of the most \nprominent car manufacturers in terms of the average CO2 emissions of the new cars they \nmanufactured in 2006. These are based on detailed statistics included in the CO2 monitoring \ndatabase (European Commission, 2010). The database, which was established with Decision \n1753/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, includes detailed volumes of \nvehicle models registered in each of the EU27 member states, providing information on the \nweight, power, capacity, fuel and type approval CO2 emissions of each car. \n\n1 Manufacturer means the body responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the EC typeapproval procedure, whereas make means the trade name of the manufacturer and is that which \nappears on the certificate of conformity. \n\n5 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                 \n\n       \n\n     \n\n     \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      \n\n     \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n      \n\n       \n\n \n\n                \n              \n                 \n\n                \n                  \n\n             \n               \n                 \n\n                \n              \n\n                  \n                \n\n              \n               \n\n               \n \u00a0          \n                   \n\n             \n           \n\n \n\nTable 1: Average mass and CO2 emissions of new cars per manufacturer in the EU27 in 2006 \n\nManufacturer \n\nBMW \n\nDaimlerChrysler \n\nFiat \n\nFord \n\nGM \n\nPorsche \n\nPSA \n\nRenault \n\nVolkswagen \n\nToyota \n\nNissan \n\nMitsubishi \n\nHonda \n\nMazda \n\nSuzuki \n\nSubaru \n\nHyundai \n\nTotal* \n\n* Mass and CO2 are sales weighted \n\nmass (kg) \n\n1453 \n\n1472\n\u00ad\n\n1112\n\u00ad\n\n1319\n\u00ad\n\n1257\n\u00ad\n\n1596\n\u00ad\n\n1201\n\u00ad\n\n1234\n\u00ad\n\n1366\n\u00ad\n\n1214\n\u00ad\n\n1202\n\u00ad\n\n1245\n\u00ad\n\n1261\n\u00ad\n\n1296\n\u00ad\n\n1152\n\u00ad\n\n1384\n\u00ad\n\n1349\n\u00ad\n\n1288.8\n\u00ad\n\nCO2 (g/km) \n\n182 \n\n184\n\u00ad\n\n144\n\u00ad\n\n162\n\u00ad\n\n157\n\u00ad\n\n282\n\u00ad\n\n142\n\u00ad\n\n147\n\u00ad\n\n165\n\u00ad\n\n152\n\u00ad\n\n164\n\u00ad\n\n169\n\u00ad\n\n153\n\u00ad\n\n173\n\u00ad\n\n164\n\u00ad\n\n216\n\u00ad\n\n165\n\u00ad\n\n159.2\n\u00ad\n\nSales total \n\n739 993 \n\n860 816\n\u00ad\n\n1 050 885\n\u00ad\n\n1 490 276\n\u00ad\n\n1 424 783\n\u00ad\n\n39 069 \n\n1 882 210 \n\n1 232 236\n\u00ad\n\n2 744 849\n\u00ad\n\n773 329\n\u00ad\n\n273 893\n\u00ad\n\n101 124\n\u00ad\n\n229 791\n\u00ad\n\n229 135\n\u00ad\n\n178 614\n\u00ad\n\n31 541\n\u00ad\n\n461 880\n\u00ad\n\n13 744 424\n\u00ad\n\nTable 2 shows the additional progress that the manufacturers will have to make in order to \nachieve their targets by 2015 under the proposed legislation, taking the limit curve into \naccount and assuming the same average weight as in 2006. It is not possible to estimate the \ncorresponding emission reductions required for 2020, as the M0 of the limit curve has not been \ndetermined yet (it will be calculated on the basis of the average mass of passenger cars in the \nprevious three calendar years, i.e. 2017-2019). Assuming the same limit curve and average \nmass, the reductions required to achieve the 2020 target have been also calculated and are \nshown in the same table. If the average mass of the vehicle increases (as it historically does) \nthe necessary reductions should be even larger than those shown in Table 2. The table shows \nthat some manufacturers are close to their average target while others are way beyond. \n\nOf course, it should be recognised that manufacturers have the right to pool at will and to be \nmonitored as one entity for the purpose of meeting their targets. This may be necessary for \nsome of the top end manufacturers (like Porsche). In forming a pool, manufacturers must \nrespect the rules of competition law and the information that they exchange should be limited \nto average specific emissions of CO2, their specific emissions targets, and their total number of \nvehicles registered. In addition, independent manufacturers who sell fewer than 10,000 \nvehicles per year and who cannot or do not wish to join a pool can instead apply to the \nCommission for an individual target. Special purpose vehicles, such as vehicles built to \naccommodate wheelchair access, are excluded from the scope of the legislation. \n\n6 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n             \n\n \n   \n\n  \n   \n\n  \n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n \n\n              \n          \n\n               \n                 \n\n                \n              \n\n               \n           \n\n                 \n               \n\n              \n                \n\n               \n               \n\n               \n                \n\n               \n          \n\n               \n             \n\nTable 2: CO2 reductions required to meet 2015 and 2020 targets by manufacturer \n\nManufacturer \nCO2 reduction (g/km) CO2 reduction (g/km) \nin 2015 in 2020 \n\nPSA Peugeot-Citroen 16 51 \nRenault 20 55 \nFiat 22 57 \nHonda 25 59 \nToyota 25 60 \nGM 28 63 \nFord 30 66 \nVolkswagen 31 66 \nHyundai 32 67 \nNissan 38 73 \nSuzuki 41 75 \nMitsubishi 41 76 \nMazda 43 78 \nBMW 45 80 \nDaimlerChrysler 46 81 \nSubaru 81 117 \nPorsche 138 173 \n\nThe regulation does not specify the technology by which the CO2-average level should be \nreached (technology-neutral approach) by manufacturer, i.e. whether small, gasoline, diesel, \nhybrid, plug-in hybrids, electric or alternative fuel vehicles will be introduced, as long as the \naverage CO2 emission level is reached. It should also be made clear that the mean CO2 levels \nrefer to the certification test procedure (i.e. the New European Driving Cycle \u2013 NEDC to be \nused for emission measurement). However, the CO2 emission rate for each technology to be \nintroduced will depend on the actual driving pattern in real-world operation. It has to be \nexpected that different vehicle technologies will perform differently over real-world operation, \ndespite meeting the target of 95 g/km over the NEDC. For example, a hybrid gasoline vehicle is \na very good performer (low CO2) in urban driving through the frequent involvement of the \nelectric motor and the regeneration of braking energy back to the batteries. However, in \nhighway driving where the electric motor has only a secondary role to play and braking is \ninfrequent, a small diesel vehicle may actually be a better performer due to the higher \nefficiency of the diesel engine over the gasoline engine in the hybrid vehicle. Therefore, the \nNEDC value alone is not necessarily the only determinant of CO2 emissions of each technology \nin real-world driving. As a result, the mean CO2 emission of the stock in real-world conditions \nwill depend on the penetration rates of different new technologies, and the difference in CO2 \n\nemissions of each technology between real-world and type-approval driving conditions. \n\nThis study attempts a first assessment of the potential impact in CO2 emissions of the \nintroduction of new technologies at a different penetration rate.

Methodology \u2013 modelling \n\nFor the purposes of the present study, the CRUISE model, AVL\u2019s vehicle and powertrain level \nsimulation tool (https://www.avl.com/cruise1), was used to simulate vehicle engine operation \nover certain driving cycles. CRUISE is a vehicle simulator. In principle, a vehicle is graphically \nsetup, providing all kinds of powertrain details (wheel size, gearbox, differential, engine type, \netc.). Then an engine map is given, where the engine characteristics (be it consumption, \npollutants, noise, etc.) are provided as a function of the engine speed and power. Then the \nvehicle is allowed to operate over different speed profiles (driving cycles) and the software \nsimulates the vehicle and engine operation by which it can produce total fuel consumed and \ntotal emissions produced. The success in the simulation depends on the quality of input data \ndelivered both on the vehicle and engine fronts. \n\nFor this study, the main variables which were used as an input to the model were fuel \nconsumption engine maps, rated engine power, frontal area and aerodynamic drag, vehicle \nmass, rolling resistance coefficient(s), gear and final drive ratios, wheel diameter and \ndimensions and weight of various components. These data were retrieved from several \nsources such as measured coast down curves, measured engine maps, type approval data \n(VCA, 2010), literature (scientific papers, ordinary press, magazines, press releases) and \nspecialised websites. \n\nThe following approach was implemented: First, some typical gasoline and diesel cars from the \nEuropean stock were selected and converted through simulation to meet the 95 g/km target. \nThis means that \u2018conventional\u2019 technology vehicles of today were further refined to meet \nfuture emission targets. This is one path of achieving the 95 g/km requirement, i.e, by gradual \nimprovements on existing widespread technologies. The second approach was to simulate two \nadvanced technology vehicles which may achieve CO2 emissions already below the 95 g/km \nrequirement. Two vehicle technologies were selected towards this target, the first being the \nwell-known gasoline hybrid technology, where an electric motor is used to assist the engine \nduring acceleration and high load conditions. The second advanced technology has been an \nelectric car with a gasoline range extender. Such a configuration also consists by an internal \ncombustion engine and electric motor by the power to the wheels is only provided by the \nelectric motor. The engine is only used to power a generator that drives the electric motor. \n\nFigure 1 shows some typical \u2018advanced\u2019 vehicle technologies and their characteristics. The \npower is shown combined and separately for the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the \nelectric motor (EM). The tailpipe CO2 emissions are according to the manufacturer over the \ncertification test. The range is shown again combined and for vehicle operation only on the \nelectric mode (EV). This table only serves as an example to demonstrate the foreseeable \navailable technologies. Out of them we decided to model a full hybrid and an electric vehicle \nwith a range extender, as two vehicle representatives that can achieve low CO2 without \ncompromises in the performance or the range achieved. \n\n8 \n\nhttps://www.avl.com/cruise1\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n        \n\n \n\n\u00a0   \n\n                 \n                 \n\n               \n               \n\n \n\n                \n                \n\n               \n                    \n\n               \n                  \n              \n               \n\n          \n\n             \n\n          \n        \n\n      \n       \n       \n\n      \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0\n\n      \n\nFigure 1: Typical \u2018advanced\u2019 vehicles and their characteristics\n\ufffd\n\n3. Vehicle configuration \n\nIn view of the 95 g/km target for 2020, four technologies are examined, which are expected to \nmeet or exceed this target. These include a small gasoline car, a small diesel car, a gasoline \nhybrid and an electric vehicle with range extender. Two different models from each of the \nformer two categories were selected for the purposes of this study, as described in the \nfollowing. \n\nTwo popular vehicle models, the Peugeot 107 1.0 and the Ford Ka 1.2 Duratec, were selected \nas representatives of the small gasoline car category. The Peugeot has one of the lowest CO2 \n\nemission value of conventional vehicles in the market today (108 g/km), while the Ford, mainly \ndue to its size, is some 30 g/km off the 2020 target. This is however a widespread vehicle in the \nEuropean stock. The two small diesel cars selected include the Smart fortwo cdi, which is \nalready below the 95 g/km limit, and the Fiat 500 1.3 MTJ, which is a typical small diesel \nvehicle with CO2 emissions close to the 2020 target. Key technical specifications for these \nvehicles are presented in Table 3. The type approval (TA) CO2 emissions reported by the \nmanufacturer for each vehicle are also included in the table. \n\nTable 3: Main technical data for the selected small gasoline and diesel cars \n\nInput parameter \nEmpty vehicle mass (kg) \nDrag coefficient\n\u00ad\nFrontal area (m2)\n\u00ad\nEngine capacity (l) \nGearbox \nFuel type\n\u00ad\n\nPeugeot 107 \n790 \n0.30 \n2.20 \n1.0 \nManual 5 gear \nGasoline\n\u00ad\n\nFord Ka \n940 \n0.34 \n2.11 \n1.2 \nManual 5 gear \nGasoline\n\u00ad\n\nSmart fortwo \n650 \n0.34 \n2.10 \n0.8 \nManual 5 gear \nDiesel\n\u00ad\n\nFiat 500 \n960 \n0.32 \n2.42 \n1.25 \nManual 5 gear \nDiesel\n\u00ad\n\n9 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n        \n        \n\n        \n\n \n\n               \n              \n                 \n\n             \n               \n\n              \n               \n\n                 \n                \n               \n\n                \n              \n\n                   \n               \n\n               \n                \n\n                \n        \n\n             \n\n                   \n                \n\n             \n                 \n\n     \n\n            \n\n      \n      \n\n    \n     \n     \n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n       \n       \n      \n\n       \n\nMax engine torque (Nm) 100 102 110 145\n\u00ad\n\nMax engine power (kW)\n\u00ad 50 51 45 55\n\u00ad\n\nTA CO2 emissions (g/km)\n\u00ad108 125 88 110 \n\nA full hybrid electric mid-size car (Toyota Prius) and an electric vehicle with range extender \n(Opel Ampera) were also selected. The CO2 emissions of the third generation Toyota Prius \n(2010 model year) are as low as 89 g/km, significantly reduced compared to the 104 g/km of \nthe previous (2nd) generation Pius. The Opel Ampera uses electricity (provided through the \ngrid) as its primary power source and gasoline as a secondary power source to generate \nelectricity through an internal combustion engine. In contrary to a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, \nthat use both the internal combustion engine and the electrical motor to directly power the \nwheels, an electric vehicle with a range extender is only propelled by the electric drive unit and \nthe engine is only used to power a generator and produce electricity to recharge the batteries. \nThis is why it is equipped with stronger electrical motor and larger batteries than hybrid \nvehicles. The Opel Ampera (expected in the European market at the beginning of 2011) will be \nthe first vehicle introducing this technology and, according to the manufacturer, will have a \nbattery range of 60 km. Within this range, it emits no tailpipe CO2, as it is practically driven as \nan electric vehicle. Key technical specifications for these two vehicles are presented in Table 4. \n\nTA CO2 emissions for the Opel Ampera are determined by the test procedure described in UNECE Regulation 101 (2005). According to this, two tests are carried out, one with a fully \ncharged battery and one with a battery in minimum state of charge. Weighted values of CO2 \n\nemissions are then calculated with the following formula: \n\nMHEV = (De \u00d7 M1 + Dav \u00d7 M2) / (De + Dav) \n\nWhere MHEV is the mass emission of CO2 (in g/km), M1 is the mass emission of CO2 (in g/km) \nwith a fully charged electrical energy/power storage device, M2 is the mass emission of CO2 (in \ng/km) with an electrical energy/power storage device in minimum state of charge (maximum \ndischarge of capacity), De is vehicle\u2019s electric range and Dav = 25 km is the assumed average \ndistance between two battery recharges). \n\nTable 4: Main technical data for the hybrid and the electric vehicle \n\nInput parameter \nEmpty vehicle mass (kg) \nDrag coefficient\n\u00ad\nFrontal area (m2)\n\u00ad\nEngine displacement (l) \nGearbox \nFuel type\n\u00ad\n\nMax engine torque (Nm)\n\u00ad\nMax engine power (kW)\n\u00ad\nMax electric motor torque (Nm)\n\u00ad\nMax electric motor power (kW) \nMax battery capacity (Ah) \nTA CO2 emissions (g/km) \n\nToyota Prius \n1379 \n0.25 \n2.61 \n1.8 \nAutomatic CVT \nGasoline \n142 \n73\n\u00ad\n\n207\n\u00ad\n\n60 \n6.5 \n89\n\u00ad\n\nOpel Ampera \nn.a. \nn.a. \nn.a. \n1.4 \nn.a. \nGasoline \n125 \n66\n\u00ad\n\n370\n\u00ad\n\n111\n\u00ad\n\n45\n\u00ad\n\n< 40\n\u00ad\n\n10 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0   \n\n                \n              \n\n             \n                \n\n               \n             \n               \n\n               \n             \n\n                \n               \n\n     \n\n               \n                \n\n                \n              \n\n                \n           \n\n    \n\n                \n             \n\n             \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0   \n\n\u00a0     \n\n\u00a0       \n\n\u00a0           \n\n\u00a0     \n\n\u00a0       \n\n             \n          \n\n              \n      \n\n                \n                   \n\n                \n                 \n\n              \n\n4. Baseline simulations \n\nAs a first step, the vehicles selected were set-up within the CRUISE model to calculate their \ntype approval CO2 emissions. To this aim, all input parameters collected related to vehicle, \nengine, transmission, wheel, electric motor and battery were introduced into the software. In \ncase any of these data were not available, CRUISE default values were used (e.g. the default \nvalues for the electric vehicle with range extender were used for simulating the Opel Ampera). \nSince the specific engine performance maps for these vehicles were not available, generic \nmaps from Euro 5 technology vehicles were used for the gasoline and the diesel engines \nrespectively. These were scaled to match the rated power of the two vehicles. Once the \nvehicles were set-up, the combined legislated driving cycle was simulated. The NEDC consists \nof an urban sub-cycle (Urban Driving Cycle \u2013 UDC) and an extra urban sub-cycle (Extra Urban \nDriving Cycle \u2013 EUDC). Where necessary, the engine maps were calibrated to match the fuel \nconsumption reported by each manufacturer. \n\nFor a correct calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the hybrid and the \nextended range electric vehicle, the battery\u2019s state of charge (SOC) at the end of the test \nshould be the same as in the beginning. Otherwise, the occurring difference (\u0394SOC) has to be \ndetermined and accounted for in the calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In \norder to correct \u0394SOC in CRUISE, multiple runs over the NEDC were performed to phase out \nthe SOC variations. These simulations showed that \u0394SOC affected significantly fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions. \n\nAs a second step, various options to reduce fuel consumption and thus achieve the 95 g/km \ntarget were examined for the conventional technologies, i.e. small gasoline and diesel vehicles. \nThe influence of the following parameters has been investigated by the model simulations: \n\n\u2013 Vehicle weight \n\n\u2013 Engine power \n\n\u2013 Drag coefficient \n\n\u2013 Frontal area \n\n\u2013 Rolling resistance \n\n\u2013 Inertia of rotating masses \n\n\u2013 Type of gear box (automatic, manual) \n\n\u2013 Number of gears and transmission ratio of gears and axis \n\n\u2013 Energy consumption of auxiliaries \n\n\u2013 Start stop function of the engine \n\nFrom the above parameters, those with the greater influence on fuel consumption were \nselected. These include vehicle weight, aerodynamics, transmission, rolling resistance and \nengine efficiency. The range by which these parameters were varied depends on the market \ninformation of the respective vehicle category. \n\nAs an example, the fuel consumption of the Ford Ka needs to be improved significantly in \norder to achieve a 30 g/km CO2 reduction. Based on the technical data shown in Table 3 as well \nas technical data from other competitive cars, it is evident that vehicle weight reduction will be \none of the first options for the manufacturer. On the other hand, though having a high CO2 \n\nreduction potential, it is envisaged that the manufacturers will not opt for reducing engine \n\n11 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                \n           \n\n       \n\n              \n             \n\n            \n    \n\n               \n            \n\n             \n                    \n\n               \n               \n\n                \n               \n\n            \n\n               \n       \n\n        \n            \n\n           \n        \n\n         \n        \n          \n\n            \n\n                   \n                \n\n            \n         \n\n\u00a0    \n\n             \n             \n\n             \n            \n\n             \n             \n\n            \n              \n\n             \n                \n\npower. This is based on observations of the market trend over the last years, where vehicles \nhave become more efficient without reducing engine power. Therefore, only marginal \nreductions should be expected, if really necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, advanced engine technologies such as variable valve timing and lift, \nturbocharging, direct fuel injection, and cylinder deactivation can be used to reduce engine \nlosses and thus increase engine efficiency. However, the margin for such technological \nimprovements is rather limited. \n\nThe options assumed for the simulations are mainly lower vehicle weight, air drag and rolling \nresistance improvements, more dense gearbox ratios and, and secondarily lower engine power \nand improved engine efficiency. From the vehicles described above, both small gasoline cars \nand one small diesel car will need to cut their CO2 emissions in view of the 95 g/km target. The \nassumed changes for these three vehicles to achieve the 2020 target are summarised in Table \n5. The other three vehicles already comply with the emission standard and thus no further \nchanges are assumed here, although it is possible that their CO2 emission level will be reduced \neven further in view of the 2020 targets. The resulting reductions in type approval CO2 \n\nemissions as calculated with CRUISE are also included in the same table. \n\nTable 5:\t\ufffd Assumed changes in vehicle specifications of the two small gasoline cars and one \nsmall diesel car and calculated CO2 reductions \n\nInput parameter Peugeot 107 Ford Ka Fiat 500 \nEmpty vehicle mass - 10 % - 25 % - 10 % \nDrag coefficient - 10 % - 20 % - 20 % \nEngine power 0 % 0 % 0 % \nGear ratios 0 % + 15 % 0 % \nRolling resistance 0 % 0 % 0 % \nEngine efficiency +5 % + 5 % + 5 % \nTA CO2 emissions - 11 % - 22 % - 11 % \n\nIt should be noted that the values assumed in Table 5 are not the only options, but they just \npresent an example of how the 95 g/km target can be reached, based on observed current \ntrends and expected future developments. Several other options exist; identifying all these \noptions is however outside the scope of this study. \n\n5. Real-world emission performance \n\nIn order to determine fuel consumption of the above selected vehicles under real-world \ndriving conditions, and not only under type approval, the Artemis driving cycles were \nintroduced in CRUISE. These were developed in the framework of a large-scale scientific \nprogramme (Assessment and Reliability of Transport Emission Models and Inventory Systems \u2013 \nARTEMIS), funded by the European Commission and aiming at the development of a \nharmonised emission model. The Artemis cycles are distinguished into three driving cycles that \nsimulate different road operating conditions: An urban cycle (Artemis Urban) resembling urban \ndriving conditions, a semi-urban cycle (Artemis Road) simulating the operation of the vehicle in \na regular medium-speed road, and an extra urban cycle (Artemis Motorway) simulating the \noperation in a high-speed road (Andr\u00e9, 2004). The three Artemis cycles can be further split into \n\n12 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n             \n              \n\n \n\n           \n\n               \n                \n              \n\n              \n                \n\n                \n            \n\n              \n\n                 \n    \n\n      \n     \n\n     \n     \n     \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\nsub-cycles, i.e. Artemis Urban (1-5), Artemis Road (1-5) and Artemis Motorway (1-4). The \nspeed profile of the Artemis cycles and the NEDC are presented in Figure 2. \n\nFigure 2: The type approval (NEDC) and the Artemis driving cycles \n\nThe simulated CO2 emissions of the above vehicles over the NEDC and Artemis driving cycles \nare presented in the following tables. Emissions of the vehicles as they are presently and with \nthe assumed changes in view of the 2020 target are included in the tables. \n\nTable 6 summarises the simulated CO2 emissions for the two small gasoline vehicles. The \nresults show that the two vehicles are expected to have similar performance in terms of fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions in 2020 (differences below 5 %), which is largely due to the \nsimilar technical characteristics of the two vehicles after the changes introduced. Real-world \nemissions are higher by 11 to 17 % on average compared to type approval. \n\nTable 6: Simulated CO2 emissions (in g/km) of the two small gasoline cars over the NEDC and \nthe Artemis driving cycles \n\nDriving cycle \nYear \n\nUDC \nEUDC \nNEDC \nArtemis urban \nArtemis road \nArtemis motorway \nArtemis (all) \n\nPeugeot 107 \n2010 \n143.4 \n89.3 \n109.0 \n168.6 \n101.3 \n126.9 \n122.7 \n\n2020 \n132.8 \n79.6 \n97.0 \n154.7 \n90.7 \n111.4 \n110.4 \n\nFord Ka \n2010 \n163.2 \n102.4 \n124.8 \n193.3 \n119.9 \n145.5 \n143.7 \n\n2020 \n137.1 \n77.7 \n97.5 \n160.1 \n90.9 \n107.2 \n108.6 \n\n13 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n                \n                  \n\n               \n                 \n              \n\n           \n\n                  \n   \n\n      \n     \n\n     \n     \n     \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n \n\n              \n               \n\n                \n                  \n\n               \n                 \n\n            \n\n              \n                 \n\n                 \n                  \n\n                \n            \n\n              \n               \n\n     \n\n                \n        \n\n      \n   \n\n   \n   \n\nThe simulation results for the two small diesel vehicles are summarised in Table 7.

Similarly to the small gasoline cars, real-world emissions are higher by 10 to 15 % on \naverage compared to type approval. The difference is considerably larger for urban cycles (by \nabout 25-30 %) than for extra-urban conditions (up to 10 %). \n\nTable 7:\t\ufffd Simulated CO2 emissions (in g/km) of the two small diesel cars over the NEDC and the \nArtemis driving cycles \n\nDriving cycle Smart Fortwo Fiat 500 \nYear 2010 2020 2010 2020 \n\nUDC 110.1 110.1 119.0 116.4 \nEUDC 81.3 81.3 100.4 85.2 \nNEDC 89.1 89.1 108.8 96.5 \nArtemis urban 141.6 141.6 163.3 144.2 \nArtemis road 76.0 76.0 119.0 94.9 \nArtemis motorway 104.9 104.9 134.2 107.2 \nArtemis (all) 97.0 97.0 131.1 111.4 \n\nTable 8 summarises the simulation results for the hybrid and the extended range electric \nvehicle. The hybrid vehicle has particularly low CO2 emissions over the hot UDC (74.5 g/km), \ndue to the electrical operation. However, the type approval is by definition a cold cycle and \nthus the CO2 emissions over the urban part are increased by about 38 % due to the continuous \noperation of the ICE in order to heat-up the catalyst. Real-world emissions in urban conditions \nare in-between these two values, i.e. higher than hot UDC and lower than cold UDC by about \n20 %, while they are on the same level for extra-urban cycles. \n\nAs mentioned previously, no tailpipe CO2 is emitted from the extended range electric vehicle \nwithin the battery range and hence the zero values in the table for most driving cycles. When \nrunning the Artemis cycles the internal combustion engine is only used for a small part of the \nmotorway cycle (in the last 5 km) to drive the electric generator. The CO2 emissions for the full \nArtemis cycles is lower compared to the Motorway cycle as the same amount of CO2 emissions \nare divided by a larger distance travelled (50.8 vs 28.7 km respectively). \n\nAs mentioned previously, these vehicles already meet the 2020 emission target and thus no \nfurther reductions are assumed here, although it is possible that their CO2 emission level will \nbe further reduced by 2020. \n\nTable 8:\t\ufffd Simulated CO2 emissions (in g/km) of the hybrid and the extended range electric car \nover the NEDC and the Artemis driving cycles\n\ufffd\n\nDriving cycle \nUDC \nEUDC \nNEDC \n\nToyota Prius \n103.0 \n78.9 \n89.9 \n\nOpel Ampera \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n14 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n \n\n\u00a0    \n\n               \n                \n\n               \n                \n\n               \n              \n\n                \n              \n\n               \n                 \n\n            \n               \n\n                \n     \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n              \n\n                \n               \n               \n\n               \n\nArtemis urban\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis road\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis motorway \nArtemis (all) \n\n89.9 \n72.3 \n105.2 \n81.1 \n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n20.9 \n11.8 \n\n6. COPERT-type emission functions\n\u00ad\n\nIn order to assess the real-world performance of the above vehicles in 2020, their CO2 \n\nemissions as a function of average vehicle speed are presented in Figure 3. As expected, fuel \nconsumption and CO2 emissions are higher at lower average speeds, they reach a minimum at \naround 50 to 80 km/h and they increase again for higher average speeds. In general, gasoline \ncars have higher CO2 emission levels compared to diesel cars, due to the lower overall \nefficiency. Gasoline hybrids perform very well in urban conditions, as they are powered mainly \nby the electric motor. On the other hand, in highway driving that the vehicle is operated \nmainly by the thermal engine, CO2 emissions are marginally lower than small diesel cars. \n\nThe emission curves clearly show that for vehicles with an internal combustion engine, there is \na narrow \u201cspeed window\u201d where the CO2 emission level is below or close to the 95 g/km \ntarget. Outside of this window, the CO2 emissions increase considerably. Another interesting \nobservation is that for very low average speeds, such as in urban environments with heavy \ntraffic and congested roads, the CO2 emissions may increase dramatically by a factor of up to \nthree for all vehicle technologies. \n\n0 \n\n50 \n\n100 \n\n150 \n\n200 \n\n250 \n\n300 \n\n350 \n\nCO\n2 \n\nem\nis\n\nsi\non\n\n fa\nct\n\nor\n (g\n\n/k\nm\n\n) \n\nSmall Gasoline \nSmall Diesel \nHEV \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 \n\nAverage speed (km/h) \n\nFigure 3: CO2 emission results of the various technologies as function of average speed \n\nFrom the values of Table 8 it is evident that the above definition of speed-dependent emission \nfactors is not appropriate for the electric vehicles with range extender. This is because the \ninternal combustion engine operates in a steady-state rather than in transient mode as in the \ncase of a conventional vehicle. As a result, the tailpipe CO2 emissions may vary substantially \n\n15 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n              \n \n\n                \n               \n\n               \n               \n\n                \n              \n\n \n\n             \n             \n\n \n  \n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n     \n     \n     \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n \n\n                \n                  \n                 \n                \n\n                 \n                \n\n             \n  \n\nover driving cycles with the same average speed and same dynamics but different distances \ncovered. \n\nTherefore, the expression of emissions as function of the total trip length is proposed to be \nused instead. To this aim a set of additional simulations were performed to calculate energy \nconsumption and CO2 emissions over longer trips for the range extender vehicle. A simple and \nstraightforward way is by adding additional Artemis Motorway cycles to the existing full set of \nArtemis cycles. This is a sensible assumption since longer trips (above 50 km) will be most \nprobably run in highway conditions. The results of these simulations are summarised in Table \n9. \n\nTable 9:\t\ufffd Simulated CO2 emissions and overall energy consumption of the extended range \nelectric car over the NEDC and various combinations of the Artemis driving cycles \n\nUDC\n\u00ad\n\nEUDC\n\u00ad\n\nNEDC\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis Urban\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis Road\n\u00ad\n\nArtemis Motorway \nAll Artemis \nAll Artemis + 1 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 2 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 3 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 4 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nAll Artemis + 5 Motorway\n\u00ad\n\nTrip length \n(km) \n\n10.94 \n3.98 \n6.96 \n4.87 \n17.27 \n28.7 \n50.9 \n79.6 \n108.3 \n137.0 \n165.7 \n194.5\n\u00ad\n\nCO2 emission \nfactor (g/km) \n\n0 \n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0\n\u00ad\n\n0 \n11.8 \n51.1 \n69.6 \n80.3 \n87.4 \n92.3\n\u00ad\n\nEnergy consum. \n(kWh/km) \n\n0.107 \n0.138 \n0.126 \n0.140 \n0.128 \n0.164 \n0.150 \n0.095 \n0.070 \n0.055 \n0.046 \n0.039\n\u00ad\n\nIt should be noted that the above driving cycles were simulated with a battery fully charged \nand can be thus considered as individual trips.

Scenario design \n\nIn order to demonstrate how the same new-stock average CO2 target may be reached with \ndifferent effects on real-world emissions, three scenarios for the penetration of the above \ntechnologies in the European vehicle stock were designed. It should be made clear that the \nscenarios are only means to demonstrate the sensitivity of real-world CO2 emissions to engine \ntechnology and by no way they dictate a particular path that has to be followed to reach a \ntarget. \n\nThe options to meet the future target of 95 g/km (tailpipe only) include shift of new vehicles to \nsmaller cars and penetration of hybrid and electric vehicles. Full electric vehicles may be \nintroduced but it is still considered that their numbers will be relatively small to have a \nsubstantial impact on mean CO2 emissions. Plug-in hybrids are the other option for an \nadvanced technology. However, it is considered that their performance is similar to the electric \nwith a range extender so they were not introduced not to unnecessarily complicate the \ncalculations. Between the four available technologies, downsized gasoline, downsized diesel, \nhybrid and electric with range extender, any mix is considered possible as long as the average \nCO2 target of the new registrations is met. \n\nIn order to demonstrate the real-world effect on CO2 emissions of the various scenarios, the \nexample of the German passenger car fleet has been selected. To this aim, projections of stock \ngrowth in Germany delivered by the EC4MACS project2 (an EU-LIFE funded program) were \nused as the basecase. Germany was selected as a country with a fast stock replacement, such \nas that targets for new registration vehicles would be immediate reflected to the total stock as \nwell. \n\nBased on these projections, total numbers of new registrations for the main passenger car \ncategories are summarised in Table 12 regarding the period 2015 to 2020. \n\n2 EC4MACS (www.ec4macs.eu) is a LIFE+ project which provides the modelling framework for integrated \nassessment of air emission policies in Europe. The project has developed detailed projections of activity, \nenergy consumption and air emissions for all European Member States, based on the PRIMES 2010 \nbaseline scenario. The data used to develop the scenarios in this project originate from the road \ntransport projections within EC4MACS. \n\n18 \n\nhttp:www.ec4macs.eu\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n         \n\n        \n\n              \n\n                    \n\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n\n              \n\n       \n\n \n\n            \n             \n\n                  \n                \n               \n\n \n\n             \n            \n\n               \n               \n\n               \n                 \n\n                \n\n            \n                  \n\n                \n              \n\n                       \n     \n\n             \n              \n\n                  \n                  \n\n           \n\n        \n\n   \n\n         \n\n         \n\n          \n\n          \n\nTable 12: New registrations of passenger cars \u2013 Basecase\n\ufffd\n\nVehicle type \n\nSmall Gasoline \n\nMedium Gasoline \n\nLarge Gasoline \n\nSmall Diesel \n\nLarge Diesel \n\nHybrid Diesel \n\nHybrid Gasoline \n\nE-REV \n\n2015 \n\n853 102 \n\n1 272 288 \n\n297 470 \n\n856 448 \n\n481 721 \n\n299 652 \n\n348 603 \n\n0 \n\n2016 \n\n900 855 \n\n1 291 960 \n\n317 847 \n\n792 277 \n\n446 204 \n\n228 306 \n\n265 181 \n\n0 \n\n2017 \n\n915 044 \n\n1 281 772 \n\n327 100 \n\n813 226 \n\n453 463 \n\n239 640 \n\n286 699 \n\n0 \n\n2018 \n\n917 766 \n\n1 268 857 \n\n330 653 \n\n830 365 \n\n459 552 \n\n251 694 \n\n308 949 \n\n0 \n\n2019 \n\n914 102 \n\n1 255 702 \n\n330 560 \n\n844 089 \n\n464 770 \n\n264 339 \n\n331 453 \n\n0 \n\n2020 \n\n907 374 \n\n1 243 982 \n\n328 580 \n\n854 938 \n\n469 352 \n\n277 451 \n\n353 794 \n\n0 \n\nIn total, three scenarios were considered, assuming different penetration rates for small, \nhybrid and electric vehicles. In all scenarios, the new technologies are substituting medium \nand big cars, i.e. those with an engine capacity above 1.4 litres for gasoline and above 2.0 litres \nfor diesel cars. The three scenarios were designed as a response to three main directions that \nare taking place in the effort to reduce CO2 emissions. These are downsizing, hybridization, and \nelectrification. \n\nThe assumed changes in new registrations, which are introduced gradually over the period \n2015 to 2020, are summarised in Table 13 for the various scenarios. \n\nScenario 1 (downsizing) assumes a shift towards small vehicles at the expense of bigger cars. \nAccording to this scenario, 70 % of medium-size gasoline cars are substituted by small ones, \nwhereas large gasoline and diesel cars are completely phased-out by 2020. In order to achieve \nthe 2020 target, 6 % of hybrids are substituted by electric vehicles. This results in the vehicle \nmarket being dominated by small cars with a 77 % share in new registrations in 2020. \n\nScenario 2 (hybridization) assumes an aggressive penetration of hybrid vehicles. According to \nthis scenario, 50 % of medium-size gasoline cars and 80 % of large gasoline and diesel cars are \nsubstituted by hybrid gasoline and diesel cars respectively by 2020. Again, 6 % of the basecase \nhybrids are substituted by electric vehicles. As a result, the penetration of hybrid vehicles \nincreases from 15 to 42 % from 2015 to 2020, whereas it is in the order of 13 to 15 % in the \nbasecase over the same period. \n\nScenario 3 (electrification) assumes an aggressive penetration of electric vehicles with a range \nextender. Compared to the previous scenarios, a smaller fraction of medium and large cars \n(20 % of medium-size gasoline cars and 30 % of large gasoline and diesel cars) is substituted by \nelectric vehicles. This results in an 11 % share of E-REV in the total new registrations in 2020. \n\nTable 13: Relative changes in new registrations compared to EC4MACS basecase\n\ufffd\n\nVehicle type 2015 2016 2017 \n\nScenario 1: Downsizing \n\nSmall gasoline cars 33% 50% 70% \n\nSmall diesel cars 6% 11% 22% \n\nPhase-out of medium cars -20% -30% -40% \n\nPhase-out of large cars -10% -20% -40% \n\n2018\n\u00ad\n\n91%\n\u00ad\n\n33%\n\u00ad\n\n-50%\n\u00ad\n\n-60%\n\u00ad\n\n2019\n\u00ad\n\n111%\n\u00ad\n\n44%\n\u00ad\n\n-60%\n\u00ad\n\n-80%\n\u00ad\n\n2020\n\u00ad\n\n132%\n\u00ad\n\n55%\n\u00ad\n\n-70%\n\u00ad\n\n-100%\n\u00ad\n\n19 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n           \n\n   \n\n           \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           \n\n   \n\n           \n\n          \n\n          \n\n         \n\n                   \n       \n\n \n\n               \n              \n\n                \n                \n\n             \n           \n\n \n\n         \n\n        \n\n   \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n              \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n                \n\n              \n\n               \n\n             \n\nReplacement of hybrids with E-REV 1% 2% 3% \n\nScenario 2: Hybridization \n\nSmall gasoline and diesel cars \n\nPhase-out of medium cars \n\nPhase-out of large cars \n\nPenetration of hybrid cars \n\nReplacement of hybrids with E-REV\n\u00ad\n\n0% \n\n-20% \n\n-5%\n\u00ad\n\n44%\n\u00ad\n\n1%\n\u00ad\n\n0% \n\n-20% \n\n-10%\n\u00ad\n\n66%\n\u00ad\n\n2%\n\u00ad\n\nScenario 3: Electrification\n\u00ad\n\nSmall gasoline and diesel cars \n\nPhase-out of medium cars \n\nPhase-out of large cars\n\u00ad\n\nPenetration of E-REV*\n\u00ad\n\n0%\n\u00ad\n\n0%\n\u00ad\n\n-5%\n\u00ad\n\n0.9%\n\u00ad\n\n0%\n\u00ad\n\n-5%\n\u00ad\n\n-10%\n\u00ad\n\n3.3%\n\u00ad\n\n0% \n\n-20% \n\n-20%\n\u00ad\n\n75%\n\u00ad\n\n3%\n\u00ad\n\n0% \n\n-10% \n\n-15%\n\u00ad\n\n5.7%\n\u00ad\n\n* These are absolute, rather than relative changes, i.e. the values are showing the share of E-REV in the \ntotal new registrations of the electrification scenario. \n\nBased on the above vehicle/technology mix and the basecase figures in Table 12, the new \nregistrations under the three scenarios were calculated and are summarised in Table 14.

CO2 emissions calculations \n\nFor the calculation of CO2 emissions, average speeds of 20, 50 and 90 km/h were assumed for \nurban, rural and highway driving. Data for the annual mileage of each vehicle category were \nalso taken from EC4MACS and values of 40, 30 and 30 % were assumed for the share of annual \nmileage driven in urban, rural and highway conditions respectively. The calculation is sensitive \nto the speed and share at each driving mode so final values may vary according to the \nconditions selected. This can be revealed with a sensitivity analysis but this was not attempted \nin this report, again in order not to introduce too many uncertainties in the calculation. \nHowever, it is highly recommended that the effect of different vehicle operation conditions \naccording to their technology on total CO2 emissions is investigated. To make it more clear, it \ncould be expected that an electric vehicle (even equipped with a range extender) will be used \n\n21 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                 \n           \n\n      \n\n                 \n            \n\n             \n                   \n\n            \n              \n\n                  \n    \n\n                 \n               \n\n              \n                  \n\n    \n\n                \n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n       \n\n \n\n            \n                 \n\n             \n          \n\nat shorter trips (e.g. urban trips) than the diesel counterpart in order for the owner to be \nbenefitted from the electrical operation. Therefore, real-world operation may be differently \ndefined according to the vehicle type. \n\nIn any case, it was decided at this stage to keep the same vehicle behaviour regardless of \ntechnology. Therefore, the activity data selected were then combined with the real-world \nemission functions developed in section 6 for each technology, to calculate CO2 emission \nfactors for the year 2020 as shown in Table 15. For previous years a yearly decrease of 2% in \nfuel efficiency was assumed. This reflects the typical year-to-year efficiency improvement of \npassenger cars recorded by the monitoring procedure (mean CO2 dropped from 172 g/km in \n2000 to 146 g/km in 2009, i.e. with a rate of 1.8% per year). These emission factors are \ncommon for all scenarios. \n\nFor the electric vehicle with a range extender it was assumed that urban trips are within their \nelectric range and thus no tailpipe CO2 is emitted.

The basecase calculation follows the assumptions \non efficiency improvement of the PRIMES 2009 baseline scenario. These are not necessarily as \ndetailed as the calculations that we have performed in this report. In addition, the basecase \ncalculation does not include the detailed real-world efficiency factors developed for hybrid and \nelectric vehicles. Therefore, absolute differences over the basecase are not important, as the \nbasecase is artificial as well. However, differences between the different scenarios are most \nimportant to study. All three scenarios predict a reduction in emissions, which is highest for \nthe hybridization scenario and lowest for the electrification scenario, whereas the downsizing \nscenario is in-between. Marginal differences may be observed for 2015 as there are only slight \ndifferences in the composition of the fleet among the basecase and the various scenarios. \n\nAlthough electric vehicles have the best performance (both in type-approval and real-world \nCO2 emissions) of all vehicle technologies considered in this study, new cars CO2 emissions in \nthe electrification scenario are only 6.5 % lower compared to basecase in 2020. This is due to \nthe fact that, compared to other scenarios, only a small fraction of the fleet has been \nsubstituted by electric vehicles (20 % of medium and 30 % of large cars), minimising thus many \nof their emission benefits. On the other hand, a considerable fraction of new registrations \n(50 % of medium and 80 % of large cars, i.e. the least energy-efficient types) is replaced by \nhybrids in the hybridization scenario, resulting in a 16.5 % decrease in CO2 emissions. This fleet \nreplacement is even larger in the downsizing scenario (70 % of medium cars replaced by small \nones, whereas large cars are completely phased-out in 2020), but this is counterbalanced by \nthe fact that small gasoline and diesel cars are less energy-efficient than hybrids. \n\nWhen considering the total CO2 emissions of the entire passenger cars fleet (i.e. not only new \nregistrations) a similar picture may be observed as shown in Figure 8. As expected, basecase \nCO2 emissions are reducing as a result of fleet renewal and penetration of new technologies \nwith improved fuel efficiency (Euro 6). \n\n75 000 \n\n80 000 \n\n85 000 \n\n90 000 \n\n95 000 \n\n100 000 \n\nTo\nta\n\nl C\nO\n\n2 \nem\n\nis\nsi\n\non\ns \n\n(k\nt)\n\n \n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 \n\nBasecase Downsizing Hybridization Electrification 95 g/km \n\nFigure 8: Development of total CO2 emissions (tailpipe only) from the passenger car fleet for \nthe various scenarios compared to basecase \n\n24 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n               \n              \n\n              \n           \n\n \n\n            \n                \n\n              \n              \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n              \n        \n\n \n\n\u00a0    \n\n               \n               \n              \n\n              \n                 \n                \n\n              \n             \n\n               \n     \n\nHowever, this reduction is much lower compared to the 95 g/km CO2 emission target specified \nin Regulation No. 443/2009 for new passenger cars.

Discussion and Conclusions \n\nCO2 emissions from passenger cars in Europe are gradually decreasing in an effort to reduce \nthe impact of road transport on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. The main tool \nthat the European Union has introduced to improve CO2 emissions from passenger cars is \nRegulation 443/2009 that stipulates that passenger cars to be first time registered in 2020 \nneed to emit 95 g/km CO2 at an average over the certification test. The regulation does not \ninfer into the technologies that need to be introduced to achieve this neither it addresses the \nimpact that real-world vehicle operation may have on actual CO2 emissions, compared to the \ncertification test. Therefore, how actual CO2 emissions will evolve and how effective this \nRegulation will be in controlling real-world CO2 emissions are important issues that will have to \nbe revealed into the future. \n\n25 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n               \n               \n\n            \n            \n\n      \n\n\u00a0             \n               \n\n             \n             \n\n     \n\u00a0             \n\n             \n             \n\n               \n          \n\n\u00a0            \n                \n\n             \n              \n\n             \n             \n\n              \n\n                 \n     \n\n            \n           \n\n              \n       \n\n              \n          \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n             \n\n\u00a0           \n            \n\n               \n \n\n\u00a0            \n              \n\n              \n            \n\n            \n   \n\nIn order to provide some preliminary response to such a question, we performed a simulation \nstudy by projecting CO2 emissions of passenger cars into the future. The projection was made \nwith three alternative scenarios, trying to capture possible options of vehicle technology \nimplementations into the future. The scenarios reflected three main directions that are \ncurrently pursued to reduce CO2 emissions: \n\n\u00ad Downsizing: Scenario 1 assumed that new registrations of vehicles are shifted from \nlarger to smaller cars. This is a tendency which is even today obvious, with all \nmainstream manufacturers extending the range of smaller cars offered (i.e. below 1.4 l \nengine capacity). Downsizing reduces emissions as a result of less energy required to \noperate small and lighter vehicles. \n\n\u00ad Hybridization: Scenario 2 introduced a large number of gasoline hybrid vehicles. Hybrid \nvehicles benefit from the combined operation of an internal combustion engine and an \nelectric motor which assists the engine over accelerations and high load conditions. As \na result, a smaller engine than in a conventional vehicle may be used which operates \nunder less transient conditions. This results to higher overall efficiency \n\n\u00ad Electrification: Scenario 3 considered the introduction of electric vehicles, i.e. vehicles \nwhere power to the wheels is delivered by an electric motor and which can be charged \ndirectly from the power grid. An electric vehicle with range extender was considered \nas the best example, i.e. a vehicle where an internal combustion engine charges the \nbatteries when depleted. This differs from hybrid because power to the wheels is \nprovided only through the electric motor. However, such an electric vehicle is not \ncompromised by a small range. Therefore, it appears as the best of both worlds. \n\nIn all scenarios, the mix of technologies was such as to achieve 95 g/km average CO2 emissions \nof new registrations in 2020. \n\nThe different vehicle technologies were simulated using an appropriate vehicle model and \ntheir CO2 emissions were determined over both type-approval and real-world driving \nconditions. Emission factors were developed in this way. These emission factors were used to \ncalculate CO2 emissions over real-world driving conditions. \n\nThe three scenarios developed were compared against a basecase scenario. This is also an \nartificial scenario, based on the EC4MACS efficiency improvements considered for passenger \ncars. \n\nThe main conclusions from this work can be summarised in the following points: \n\n\u00ad The actual real-world emission factors of improved future technologies of \nconventional diesel and gasoline passenger cars are higher than the certification test \nof 95 g/km. The difference for gasoline cars is +12\u00b11% cars and +10\u00b11.2% for diesel \ncars. \n\n\u00ad Advanced vehicle technologies (hybrid and electric with range extender) may achieve \nreal-world CO2 emissions which are already much lower than the 95 g/km target. In \nparticular for the electric vehicle, this depends a lot on the mean trip distance \ntravelled. Starting with fully charged batteries, the 95 g/km target is achieved \napproximately after 170 km and the emission asymptotically reaches 120 g/km for \nlonger trip distances. \n\n26 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0              \n               \n\n        \n\u00a0              \n\n           \n             \n\n           \n\u00a0              \n\n              \n         \n\n\u00a0           \n\u00a0             \n\n          \n           \n\n             \n             \n\n            \n\u00a0            \n\n            \n               \n\n              \n       \n\n\u00a0             \n       \n\n\u00a0              \n            \n\n            \n          \n\n         \n\n\u00a0               \n             \n\n               \n           \n\n\u00a0                 \n             \n           \n\n        \n\n                \n            \n\n              \n             \n\n           \n               \n\n          \n\n              \n             \n\n\u00ad Because of their unique characteristics, the mix of technologies to be introduced does \nhave an impact on real-world CO2 emissions, even if one considers a fixed new stock \naverage CO2 of 95 g/km in 2020. \n\n\u00ad The scenario mostly based on downsizing achieves 12 % CO2 reductions over the \nbasecase, the hybridization scenario achieves 17 % reduction and the electrification \nscenario achieves 7 % reduction. For comparison, if the real-world CO2 emission factor \nwas 95 g/km, the actual reduction would have been 18 %. \n\n\u00ad For the German passenger car stock, the difference of Scenario 3 (electrification) over \nScenario 2 (hybridization) is 12.7 % higher CO2 emissions of new passenger cars in \n2020, while both scenarios meet the 95 g/km target. \n\n\u00ad\t The sometimes counter-intuitive conclusions are based on the following effects: \no\t Introduction of an electric vehicle with very high CO2 reductions provides the \n\nmargin to introduce heavier vehicles with high CO2 emissions. Therefore, \nintroduction of electric vehicles leads to lower real-world CO2 reductions than \nany of the other three scenarios. It should be recognized that this conclusions \ngreatly depend on how electric vehicles are used. If electric vehicles are only \nused for short urban trips then actual CO2 reductions will be higher. \n\no\t Hybridization achieves the best overall result because hybrid vehicles seem to \nperform very well under all driving conditions. By having a certification CO2 \n\nvalues close to the target, they do not allow the introduction of heavy cars if \nthe target is to be met. This safeguards that the certification CO2 value holds \ntrue for most of the real-world conditions. \n\no\t Downsizing is also a good option. However, small vehicles still behave worse \nthan hybrids under certain conditions (urban driving). \n\n\u00ad\t The benefit of introducing electric vehicles to meet the CO2 target is further \ncompromised if one considers the upstream CO2 emitted for electricity production. By \ntaking the average European carbon intensity into account, the benefits of the \nelectrification diminish, reaching only 1.6 % over the base case. \n\nThe impacts of these results are at least two-fold: \n\n1.\t\u00ad The actual effect of regulation 443/2009 strongly depends on the technology mix to be \nintroduced. Between the best and the worst scenario developed, the difference in CO2 \n\nemissions of new passenger cars is approximately 13%. In other words, it is like having \na target of 107 g/km instead of 95 g/km in 2020. \n\n2.\t\u00ad Electric vehicles can be the most efficient in terms of CO2. Because of this, they leave \nroom for CO2 inefficient vehicles to survive. As CO2 emissions of inefficient vehicles \ndiffer significantly between real-world and type-approval, the net effect of electric \nvehicles can be negative compared to alternative scenarios. \n\nOne needs to recognise that this has been only an exploratory study trying to identify possible \nside-impacts of regulation 443/2009. In this direction, the scenarios developed and the \ntechnology mix considered per scenario are plausible but not the only possibilities. In addition, \na number of issues may require additional attention. For example, real-world conditions may \ndiffer according to vehicle types and characteristics. Similarly, technology of \u2018conventional\u2019 \nvehicles may evolve in a direction not foreseen in this analysis (e.g. brake energy recuperation, \nmore efficient start and stop systems, new engine concepts, etc.). \n\nStill, despite these limitations, our analysis demonstrates that there are possible ways to meet \nthe regulation requirements into the future while greatly deviate in real-world CO2 emissions. \n\n27 \n\f\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n                \n           \n\n \n\n\u00a0  \n\n             \n       \n\n             \n          \n\n           \n           \n\n \n\n              \n          \n\n              \n \n\n              \n \n\nThis requires some further attention in order to avoid a situation where the letter of the \nregulation is met but the target (actual CO2 reduction) is not. \n\n10.

For the first time, average CO2 emissions from new vans also increased in 2018. More efforts are needed from manufacturers to reduce vehicle CO2 emissions.\nAccording to the EEA report \u2018Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\u2019, emissions from new cars registered in the EU, the UK and Iceland in 2018 increased mainly due to the growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, in particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment, and the limited market uptake of zero\u2010 and low\u2010emission vehicles, including electric cars. The 2018 data on new registrations can be explored through a new EEA data dashboard.\nAfter a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 g CO2/km, average emissions from new cars increased by 0.4 g CO2/km in 2017 and by 2.3 g CO2/km in 2018 to reach 120.8 g CO2/km. While this is 7 % below the 2018 target of 130 g CO2/km, a considerable 27 % gap must still be filled to reach the target of 95 g CO2/km that applies from 2020 on.\nSimilarly, average emissions of new vans had decreased by 24 g CO2/km between 2012 and 2017, but increased from 156.1 g CO2/km in 2017 to 157.9 g CO2/km in 2018. While this is 10 % below the 2018 target of 175 g CO2/km, average emissions were still 7 % above the 2020 target.\nMany factors affected the increase in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, including an increase in the mass, engine capacity and size of the vehicles. The market share of petrol vans increased but remained limited, constituting 3.6 % of the new fleet (2.4% in 2017). The share of zero- and low-emission vans remained stable, at 1.7 % of the fleet.\nAll manufacturers, except one, met their specific CO2 emission targets in 2018 but were still far away from their 2020 targets. Automobili Lamborghini SPA exceeded its specific emission targets for 2018 and is therefore required to pay excess emission premiums. Amongst the large manufacturers, Toyota is the closest to reaching its future targets, with an estimated distance to the 2020 target of around 5 g CO2/km, while Mazda Corporations the furthest, with a distance to 2020 target of 39 g CO2/km.\nAll van manufacturers met their specific CO2 emission targets in 2018, taking into account pools and derogations. Some of the largest van makers, including Automobile Peugeot, Automobile Citroe\u0308n, Ford\u2010Werke GmbH and Iveco, have already achieved average specific CO2 emissions below their 2020 target level. Other manufacturers, including Nissan International, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Europe, are also very close to their 2020 targets.\nSince 2010, the officially reported average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars have decreased substantially. These reductions can be attributed to both the overall improvement of car energy efficiency, as well as a change in the mix of car models sold, towards more efficient powertrains and technologies. Engine downsizing and the uptake of electric vehicles have had a positive effect on reducing CO2 emissions but the growing share of SUVs has systematically led to an increase in emissions. The \u2018de-dieselisation\u2019 of the fleet has increased average emissions but its overall effect on each car manufacturer\u2019s performance depends on the fleet characteristic of the manufacturer.\nThe emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, gradually replacing the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. In 2018, Member States reported both NEDC and WLTP emission factors for around 4.4 million cars (around 30 % of new registrations). For those vehicles, the WLTP emission factor was on average 20 % higher than the NEDC emission factor.\nThe EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger cars and new vans registered in Europe, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 631/2019. The data reported by all EU Member States, the UK and Iceland in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle mass. The data reported by Iceland were included for the first time.\nIn 2020, the EEA will collect, also for the first time, data on CO2 emissions from heavy duty vehicles (trucks). These will be published in 2021.\n2018\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-cars-and-vans-sold or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:14 AM\nFiled under: co2 emissions cars and vans emissions\nFiled under: co2 emissions, cars and vans emissions\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "CO2 performance emissions of new vans in Europe\nFollowing a steady decline until 2017 and a slight increase between 2017 and 2018, average specific CO2 emissions from new vans registered in Europe remained stable at 158.0 g CO2/km in 2019.

In 2019, a new regulation introduced fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030, namely a 15 % reduction from 2021 emission levels by 2025 and a 31 % reduction by 2030.\nAfter a steady decline from 2012 to 2017, by 24 g CO2/km, average emissions from new vans had slightly increased by 2018 and remained stable at 158.0 g CO2/km, in 2019. Although these emissions are below the 2014-2019 target of 175 g CO2/km, they are well above the 2020-2024 target of 147 g CO2/km.\nIn 2019, 1.67 million new vans were registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. Diesel vehicles constituted 94 % of registrations in 2019.\nRegistrations of plug-in hybrid electric and battery-electric vans nearly doubled between 2018 (0.8 %) and 2019 (1.4 %), but overall remained low. Norway (6.1 %) and Iceland (4.4 %) had the highest shares of battery-electric vans registered, while hardly any plug-in hybrid electric vans were registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway or the United Kingdom in 2019.\n|Pools of van manufactures||Average CO2 emissions||Specific emissions target|\n|KIA||121.1||149.4|\n|GROUPE PSA||135.7||167.8|\n|RENAULT||143.9||166.6|\n|FCA ITALY SPA||156.7||169.2|\n|FORD-WERKE GMBH||170||200.6|\n|VOLKSWAGEN GROUP LCV||172.5||193.1|\n|DAIMLER||189.5||213.3|\n|MITSUBISHI MOTORS||189.6||196.4|\n|HYUNDAI||193.7||202.4|\nAccording to the Regulation, manufacturers can group together as pools and act jointly to meet their CO2 standards.

Key reasons include the growth in the sport utility vehicle segment and an increased average mass. In 2019, average CO2 emissions from all new cars reached 122.3 g CO2/km. Although this is below the EU fleet-wide target of 130 g CO2/km set for the period 2015-2019, it is well above the 2021 target of 95 g CO2/km, phased-in in 2020.

In 2019, a new Regulationset new fleet-wide targets for 2025 and 2030, namely a 15% reduction from 2021 emission levels by 2025 and a 37.5% reduction by 2030.\nAfter a steady decline between 2010 and 2016, by almost 22 g CO2/km, average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017, 2018 and 2019, reaching 122.3 g CO2/km in 2019. Although this remains below the 2015-2019 target of 130 g CO2/km, it is well above the 2020-2024 target of 95 g CO2/km.\nThere are various reasons for the increase in emissions, for instance the growth in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment of the road transport sector. Almost 15.5 million new cars were registered in 2019 in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and about 38% of these were SUVs. SUVs are typically heavier than other cars and have more powerful engines and larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase fuel consumption. Most new SUVs registered were petrol vehicles, with average emissions of 134 g CO2/km, which is around 13 g CO2/km higher than other new petrol cars. Moreover, the average mass of new conventional cars, excluding SUV, increased by around 22 kg from 2018 to 2019.\nThe market penetration of electric cars remained low in 2019 and, as in 2018, petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, constituting 59% of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles constituted 31% of new registrations. Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles did continue to increase, however, reaching about 3.5% in 2019, compared with 2% in 2018. Non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which are exclusively fuelled by conventional fuels, represented around 4% of new registrations. Registrations of electric vehicles, as a percentage of all newly registered cars, were highest in Norway (56%), Iceland (19%), the Netherlands (16%) and Sweden (12%). These countries were also among the few where the average emissions of new cars fell between 2018 and 2019.

Pools or individual manufacturers responsible for fewer than 300,000 newly registered cars may benefit from a derogation.\nIn 2019, almost all car manufacturers, either individually, or as members of pools or because of derogations, met their annual binding targets for newly registered passenger car fleets in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. Only four manufacturers, registering less than 13,000 vehicles a year, Automobili Lamborghini SPA, Bentley, Maserati and SsangYong, exceeded their emission targets.\nAmong the larger manufacturers, Toyota achieved the best CO2 performance, with average specific emissions of 108 g CO2/km, being closest to its 2020 objective. This performance was closely followed by those of Automobile Citroen and Peugeot, with average CO2 emissions of around 110 g CO2/km."]}
