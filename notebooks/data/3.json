{"query": "How many premature deaths are attributed to PM2.5?", "texts": ["Health impacts of exposure to fine particulate matter in Europe\nThe EU\u2019s zero pollution action plan aims to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by at least 55% by 2030, from 2005 levels. Between 2005 and 2019, the number of premature deaths in the EU attributed to PM2.5 fell by 33%. If the number of premature deaths continues to fall at this rate, the 55% target will be achieved by 2032 at EU level. In 2019, as in previous years, the highest numbers of deaths per inhabitant were reported in Balkan regions, where solid fuel burning causes high PM2.5 levels, and the lowest numbers in Scandinavian regions, where PM2.5 levels are lower.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\n|Year||Premature deaths||Evolution in the number of premature deaths||Zero Pollution Action Plan 2030 target|\n|2005||456000||446378.9471|\n|2006||437547.3682|\n|2007||428715.7893|\n|2008||419884.2104|\n|2009||400000||411052.6315|\n|2010||402221.0526|\n|2011||391000||393389.4737|\n|2012||365000||384557.8948|\n|2013||398000||375726.3159|\n|2014||361000||366894.737|\n|2015||360000||358063.1581|\n|2016||342000||349231.5792|\n|2017||354000||340400.0003|\n|2018||346000||331568.4214|\n|2019||307000||322736.8425|\n|2020||313905.2636|\n|2021||305073.6847|\n|2022||296242.1058|\n|2023||287410.5269|\n|2024||278578.948|\n|2025||269747.3691|\n|2026||260915.7902|\n|2027||252084.2113|\n|2028||243252.6324|\n|2029||234421.0535|\n|2030||225589.4746||205200|\n|2031||216757.8957||205200|\n|2032||207926.3168||205200|\n|2033||199094.7379||205200|\nAir pollution is a major cause of premature death and disease in Europe and is the single largest environmental health risk. The air pollutant deemed to cause the most severe impacts on human health is fine particulate matter (PM2.5).\nThe European Green Deal calls for the European Commission to revise the EU\u2019s air quality standards to bring them more in line with the latest World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on air quality. In response, the EU\u2019s zero pollution action plan sets the goal of reducing the number of premature deaths caused by PM2.5 by a minimum of 55% by 2030, relative to 2005 levels.\nThe EEA estimates that in 2005, 456,000 premature deaths in the 27 EU Member States (EU-27) were attributable to exposure to PM2.5. Therefore, a 55% reduction would be equivalent to the number of premature deaths falling to 205,000 per year. Between 2005 and 2019, the number of premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 exposure fell by 33% in the EU-27, to 307,000. This decrease can be explained by a decline in the concentrations of PM2.5 and therefore a decrease in the exposure of the population to this pollutant. For instance, annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 decreased on average by 22% in the decade 2009-2018. Moreover, exposure of the urban population to PM2.5 concentrations above the 2005 WHO guideline level of 10 \u00b5g/m3 decreased from 97% in 2006 to 61% in 2019. These improvements are the result of national and regional policies that target, for instance, domestic heating, the main source of primary PM2.5, and the implementation of the National Emission Reduction Commitments Directive, which contributed to a decline in the EU\u2019s emissions of PM2.5 by 29 % between 2005 and 2019.\nIf air quality continues to improve, and the number of premature deaths per year continues to fall at a rate comparable to that of previous years, the zero pollution action plan target of a 55% decline in the number of premature deaths attributed to air pollution will be achieved by 2032. However, continuing to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 at the current rate over the next decade will be challenging. To meet the target, Member States will need to fully implement their national air pollution control programmes and the measures needed to reach their 2030 climate and energy targets.\nTo allow comparison of the impact of air pollution on human health across the different regions of Europe, the number of premature deaths can be expressed per 100,000 inhabitants. Of the regions for which data are available, the Skopski region, North Macedonia, and Podunavska oblast, Serbia, had most premature deaths in 2019, with 225 and 205 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Finnmark in Norway (with 11 premature deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and Sogn og Fjordane, Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and Nordland also in Norway (13 premature deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) have the lowest numbers.\nIn general, estimates suggest that regions in the Balkans have the highest numbers of premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, especially regions in Bulgaria and Serbia. This is the result of the burning of solid fuels for domestic heating and also industry in these regions. In contrast, regions in the Scandinavian peninsula, especially in Norway and Sweden, where PM2.5 concentrations tend to be low, have the lowest numbers of premature deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.\nAn interactive version of the map in Figure 2 can be found here.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

In 2019, air pollution continued to drive a significant burden of premature death and disease in the 41 countries reporting to EEA: 373,000 premature deaths were attributed to chronic exposure to PM2.5; 47,700 premature deaths were attributed to chronic NO2 exposure; 19,070 premature deaths were attributed to acute O3 exposure. The analysis on the EU\u2019s progress to reach the 2030 target established in the Zero Pollution Action Plan shows a steady decrease in the number of premature deaths along the years, and if it continues to fall at a comparable rate in the future, then the target would be achieved by 2032. Had the new WHO air quality guideline level for PM2.5 of 5 \u00b5g/m3 been attained already in 2019 everywhere in Europe, the number of estimated premature deaths would have been at least 58 % lower.

Heart disease and stroke are the most common reasons for premature deaths \nattributable to air pollution, followed by lung diseases and lung cancer.  \n\nThis report estimates the health risk related to air pollution in 2019 considering the number of \npremature deaths and years of life lost related to exposure to fine particulate matter, ozone and \nnitrogen dioxide, both for the 27 Member States of the European Union and for additional European \ncountries to sum up a total of 41. Besides the sensitivity studies typically presented in the EEA\u2019s risk \nassessment on concentration-response functions and counterfactual concentrations the potential \nhealth benefits of attaining the EU air quality standards and the WHO guideline values for fine \nparticulate matter in ambient air are assessed. It also assesses progress towards the health-related \nobjective of the EU\u2019s Zero Pollution Action Plan. Finally, it presents the latest estimates of the health \nimpacts of exposure to the following key air pollutants: fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and \nozone. \n\nThe results in general show that the largest health risks are estimated for the countries with the \nlargest populations. However, in relative terms, when considering e.g., years of life lost per 100 000 \ninhabitants, the largest relative risks are observed in central and eastern European countries for \nPM2.5, in central and southern European countries for NO2, and  south and eastern European for O. \nThe lowest impact is found for the northern and north-western parts of Europe,  where the \nconcentrations are lowest. \n\nThe analysis on the EU\u2019s progress to reach the 2030 target established in the Zero Pollution Action Plan \nshows a steady decrease in the number of premature deaths along the years, and if it continues to fall \nat a comparable rate in the future, then the target would be achieved by 2032. The assessment on the \nminimum gains in avoided mortality should PM2.5 EU standards and WHO recommendations have been \nreached already in 2019 shows that reaching the EU limit value of 25 \u00b5g/m3 would have left the \nestimated number of premature deaths unchanged  in EU-27; if the 41 countries are considered, the \ndifference in mortality would have been of only 0.3 %. On the contrary, had the new WHO air quality \nguideline level of 5 \u00b5g/m3 been attained in all areas where concentrations were above it, the number \nof estimated premature deaths would have been at least 58 % lower in average for the 41 European \ncountries and for the EU-27. \n \n\n \n \n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 5 \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis Eionet report has been produced by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in close cooperation \nwith the European Topic Centre on Air pollution, noise, transport and industrial pollution (ETC/ATNI).  \n \nThe EEA task manager has been Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Ortiz and the ETC/ATNI manager, Cristina Guerreiro \n(NILU).

Heart disease and stroke are the most common reasons for premature deaths \nattributable to air pollution, followed by lung diseases and lung cancer (WHO, 2018). The International \nAgency for Research on Cancer has classified air pollution, in particular fine particles or particulate \nmatter with a diameter of 2.5 \u00b5m or les (PM2.5), as a leading cause of cancer. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) provides evidence of links between exposure to air pollution and type 2 diabetes, \nobesity, systemic inflammation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. A recent global review found that \nchronic exposure can affect every organ in the body, complicating and exacerbating existing health \nconditions (Schraufnagel et al., 2019). \n \nAir pollution also has considerable economic impacts. It increases medical costs and reduces economic \nproductivity due to the ill health of workers. Particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and \nground-level ozone (O3) are the pollutants that cause the greatest harm to human health and the \nenvironment in Europe.  \n \nMortality is the health outcome for which the scientific evidence is more robust. It is also the most \nserious effect of air pollution. In the past, the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European \nTopic Centre on Air pollution, noise, transport and industrial pollution (ETC/ATNI), and its \npredecessors, have been estimating mortality due to long-term exposure to air pollution. The \nmethodology used for such calculations is explained in several reports (ETC/ACM, 2017a; EEA, 2018; \nETC/ATNI, 2020a) and the results have been published in the Air quality in Europe report series (EEA, \n2020) and in (ETC/ATNI, 2020a).  \n \nThe methodology used by EEA and ETC/ATNI to estimate mortality follows the recommendations made \nby the World Health Organization back in 2013 (WHO, 2013a). As explained later in the current report  \n \n\n\u2022 for PM2.5, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered in people aged over 30 years for all \nconcentrations (i.e., concentrations above 0 \u00b5g/m3), assuming a linear increase in the risk of \nmortality of 6.2 % for a 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in PM2.5; \n\n\u2022 for NO2, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered in people aged over 30 for concentrations \nabove 20 \u00b5g/m3, assuming a linear increase in the risk of mortality of 5.5 % for a 10 \u00b5g/m3 \nincrease in NO2; \n\n\u2022 for O3, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered for all ages, assuming a linear increase in the \nrisk of mortality of 0.29 % for a 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in O3 values over 35 ppb. \n\n \nFurthermore, the calculations have come together with a sensitivity analysis using various \nconcentrations above which to consider the health impacts (or counterfactual values), namely the \neffects from 2.5 \u00b5g/m3 for PM2.5 (on top of 0 \u00b5g/m3, as mentioned above), from 10 \u00b5g/m3 for NO2 (on \ntop of 20 \u00b5g/m3, as mentioned above), and from 10 ppb for O3 (on top of 35 ppb, as mentioned above). \n \nTo protect human health against the effects of long-term exposure to air pollution, the European Union \nhas set air quality standards in the Ambient air quality Directive (AAQD) (EU, 2008). These standards \ntook into account the WHO recommendations and guidelines (WHO, 2006). Both, air quality standards \nand air quality guideline levels are maximum concentration values that should not be exceeded (see \nTable 1.1). In the case of the European Union, limit and target values are concentrations that must be \nattained and not exceeded once attained. In case of exceedances, the States must implement air \nquality plans in order to achieve the limit and target values. In the case of the WHO, the guidelines try \nto be reference tools to help policy makers in setting standards and goals for air quality management. \nThey also include the so-called \u201cinterim targets\u201d, that are concentrations associated with a specified \ndecrease of mortality risk proposed as incremental steps in progressive reduction of air pollution. The \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 7 \n\ninterim targets are intended for use in areas where pollution is high. They reflect the essence of benefit \nassessment based on linear concentration\u2013response associations. The WHO has just completed and \npublished a review of its AQ Guidelines (WHO, 2021) \n \nThe WHO, in the context of the revision of its air quality guidelines, has conducted a series of \nsystematic reviews investigating associations between a range of air pollutants and human health \noutcomes. Two of these systematic reviews address long-term exposure to PM (Chen, J. and Hoek, G., \n2020) and NO2 and O3 (Huangfu, P. and Atkinson, R., 2020). In them, new relative risks are proposed \nfor associations for the pollutants and mortality. Nevertheless, for the calculations presented in this \nreport, it was decided to keep the relative risks and counterfactual values used in the past. In this way, \ncomparisons with the past values are easily performed, and no additional sources of uncertainty (apart \nto that inherent to the methodology itself) are introduced. For future studies, and once the new WHO \nair quality guidelines are published and the evidence in the systematic reviews is discussed, it is \nplanned to incorporate the new recommendations.  \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 8 \n\nTable 1.1: Some relevant air quality standards for protection of human health from exposure to \nPM2.5, NO2 and O3 \n\n  EU Air quality Directive \n2008/50/EC \n\nWHO air quality guidelines \n\n2005 2021 \n\nPollutant Averaging \nperiod \n\nStandard and \nconcentration \n\nComments Level and concentration \n\nPM2.5 Annual   IT 1, 35 \u00b5g/m3 IT 1, 35 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n  LV, 25 \u00b5g/m3  IT 2, 25 \u00b5g/m3 IT 2, 25 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n  Indicative LV, 20 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\n   \n\n    IT 3, 15 \u00b5g/m3 IT 3, 15 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n    AQG, 10 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\nIT 4, 10 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n     AQG, 5 \u00b5g/m3 \n\nNO2 Annual  LV, 40 \u00b5g/m3  AQG, 40 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\nIT 1, 40 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n     IT 2, 30 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n     IT 3, 20 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n     AQG, 10 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\nO3 Maximum \ndaily 8-hour \nmean \n\n  IT 1, 160 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\nIT 1, 160 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\n  TV, 120 \u00b5g/m3 Not to be \nexceeded on more \nthan 25 days per \nyear, averaged \nover three years \n\n IT 2, 120 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\n    AQG, 100 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\nAQG, 100 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\n Peak season    IT1, 100 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\n     IT2, 70 \u00b5g/m3 \n\n     AQG, 60 \n\u00b5g/m3 \n\n \nNotes: LV: limit value; TV: target value; IT: interim target; AQG: air quality guideline. \nPeak season means \u201cAverage of daily maximum 8-hour mean O3 concentration in the six consecutive months \nwith the highest six-month running-average O3 concentration\u201d. \nSources: EU, 2008, WHO (2006, 2021). \n\n \n \nApart from the AQ legal standards set in the AAQDs, the European Union has established in its \nstrategies to abate air pollution specific targets and objectives related to the impacts on human health \nof air pollution. In 2013, the Clean Air Policy Package, adopted after an extensive review of the EU air \npolicy to that date, included a Clean Air Programme for Europe (EU, 2013), that set an objective of \nreducing by 52 % in 2030 the premature mortality due to particulate matter and ozone, relative to \n2005. \n \nThe recently published Zero Pollution Action Plan (EU, 2021), in the context of the European Green \nDeal (EU, 2019), has slightly modified that target. The new goal is to reduce by 2030 the number of \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 9 \n\npremature deaths caused by PM2.5 by 55%, again relative to 2005. Furthermore, the Zero Pollution \nAction Plan has the vision for 2050 that air pollution is reduced to levels no longer considered harmful \nto health and natural ecosystems. \n \nDespite applying the same methodology as in the past EEA\u00b4s Air quality in Europe reports, the results \npresented in this study are not fully comparable to those in previous studies by EEA and ETC/ATNI. This \nis because the calculations, previously produced under the ETC system, are now undertaken internally \nat the EEA. As explained in Soares et al., 2021, the use of different input data sources for mortality and \nthe use of different proxy for gap filling data in the countries not reporting health data, makes the \nresults slightly different, but does not change the results dramatically. Using different mortality input \ndata results on minor differences for countries with low population density and gap-filling affects \nmostly the Western Balkan countries.  \n \nThe present report presents the impact of air pollution on health in 2019 and the results of several \nanalyses. Chapter 2 presents the data used in the different analyses of the report. Chapter 3 shows the \ncalculations in terms of mortality (both premature deaths and years of life lost) for year 2019, following \nthe same structure as in the previous Air quality in Europe reports. Chapter 4 assesses how close the \nEU is to reach the 2030 target as established in the Zero Pollution Action Plan, by comparing the 2019 \nsituation with that in 2005. Chapter 5 presents a benefit analysis of the gains in avoided mortality \nshould different EU standards and WHO recommendations have been reached already in 2019.  \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 10 \n\n2 Input data used in the HRA calculations \n\nThe health risk assessment presented throughout the report for the 41 countries across Europe are \nbased on gridded data: ambient air concentrations and population density data. Thus, the estimation \nis done for each grid cell and then aggregated per country (or group of countries). Please see detailed \nmethodology at (ETC/ATNI, 2020a) and references herein. \n\n2.1 Ambient air concentrations \n\nConcentration maps with annual statistics of the relevant pollutant metrics are produced on a 1*1 km2 \ngrid resolution for most of Europe (whole Europe apart from Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and European \nparts of Russia and Kazakhstan). The annual statistics are estimated using a mapping method \n(\u2018Regression \u2013 Interpolation \u2013 Merging Mapping\u2019) that combines the monitoring data from rural and \nurban background stations for PM2.5, O3 and NO2 with results from the EMEP chemical transport model \nand other supplementary data, such as altitude, meteorology, and population density (ETC/ATNI, 2021 \nand references herein) using linear regression model followed by kriging of its residuals. For NO2, and \nsince 2017 maps also for PM2.5, urban traffic station data was also included to take into account \nhotspots, since traffic is the most important source of NO2 and an important source of PM. In this \nmethodology, separate rural and urban background (and for NO2 and PM2.5 also urban traffic) map \nlayers are created separately and subsequently merged into the final map. A caveat for the \nconcentration maps is the exclusion of overseas territories such as Madeira, Azores, Canary Islands, \nFrench Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and R\u00e9union. These territories are therefore \nexcluded of the HRA calculations. In this report, the final merged maps in 1*1 km2 grid resolution are \nused as input data for the health risk assessment. Both 2005 and 2019 maps have been produced based \non the most up-to-date methodology, i.e., including the urban traffic map layer for both NO2 and PM2.5, \n\nas described in (ETC/ATNI, 2021). \n \n\n2.1.1 2005 data \n\nEuropean air quality maps for 2005 for PM2.5, O3 and NO2 were produced in (ETC/ATNI, 2020b) and are \nreproduced here for convenience. \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 11 \n\nMap 2.1: Concentration map of PM2.5 annual average, 2005 \n\n \nNote: Turkey is not included due to the lack of air quality data. \n\n \n \n\nMap 2.2: Concentration map of NO2 annual average, 2005 \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 12 \n\n \n \n\nMap 2.3: Concentration map of O3 indicator SOMO35, 2005 \n\n \n \n \n\n2.1.2 2019 data \n\nEuropean air quality maps for 2019 for PM2.5, O3 and NO2 were produced in (ETC/ATNI, 2021) and are \nreproduced here for convenience. \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 13 \n\nMap 2.4: Concentration map of PM2.5 annual average, 2019 \n\n \nNote: Turkey is not included because, due to the lack of rural PM2.5 stations, no proper interpolation results could \nbe estimated for this country in a rural map. \n\n \n \n\nMap 2.5: Concentration map of NO2 annual average, 2019 \n\n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 14 \n\nMap 2.6: Concentration map of O3 indicator SOMO35, 2019 \n\n \n \n \n\n2.2 Population \n\n2.2.1 Population grid and country total population numbers \n\nThe population density map used for estimating annual statistics is based on the GEOSTAT 2011 \ndataset (Eurostat, 2014), and is mapped on the same grid resolution as the ambient air concentrations, \nfacilitating the health outcomes estimation. To make use of the population density available, the \nGEOSTAT 2011 population data was scaled with the total population data available country-wise from \nEurostat (Eurostat, 2021a), for 2005 and 2019. The data reflects the total population on the 31st of \nDecember of the indicated year reported by the National Statistical offices.  \n \nThe scaling of the population (scaled popi) was done, for years 2005 and 2019, by applying the \nfollowing:  \n \n\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc8a = \ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc8a  \u00d7\n\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc84_\ud835\udc6c\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95\n\n\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc84\n, \n\n \nwhere : \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 is the population in the ith grid cell for country c in the GEOSTAT 2011 population density \nmap,  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 is the total population for country c calculated based on the GEOSTAT 2011 population \ndensity map, and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50_\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61 is the total population reported to Eurostat for country c for years 2005 \nand 2019. \n \nSince the concentration maps do not include overseas territories, population data for those territories \nneed to be excluded from the original Eurostat data.

The data for 2005 \nand 2019 is available from Eurostat (Eurostat, 2021b), with 1-year interval, for almost all countries. \nGap filling of missing information is only necessary for Kosovo (2005), Bosnia and Herzegovina, San \nMarino and Monaco (both for 2005 and 2019). It is done by using relative age distribution numbers \n(that is, the percentage of population in each age group) from Serbia for Kosovo and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, from Italy for San Marino, and from France for Monaco. \n \n\n2.3 Demographic data \n\n2.3.1 Data on cause of death, number of deaths and life expectancy \n\nEurostat data on cause of death (Eurostat, 2021c) is available since 2011 for 5-year interval, from less \n\nthan 1 year to \u201995 years or over\u2019. It is compiled based on the ICD10 Mortality Tabulation List, the latest \n\ntabulation existing for mortality data. \n\nFor the health outcomes, and according to the description of the concentration-response functions \n(CRFs, see section 2.4), only natural deaths should be considered. Therefore, causes of death due to \ninjury or poisoning (V01-Y89) and unknown and unspecified causes (R00-R99) as well as total deaths \ndue to all causes, are excluded before calculations. \n\nEstimation of natural deaths with 1-year interval is based on interpolation using ratio between all \nnatural deaths and all causes deaths (5-year interval) and Eurostat data on total number of deaths \n(Eurostat, 2021d) given with 1-year interval.  \n \nAfter this operation, mortality data is aligned with life expectancy data, available from Eurostat \n\ndatabase (Eurostat, 2021e) on a 1-year interval, by age and sex, from 0 to 85+ years old, since 1960. \n\nTo reflect all age groups available for mortality data (up to 95+), life expectancies are extrapolated for \n\nages above 85, using regression on life expectancy data for age groups 79 \u2013 85. \n\n2.3.2 Data gap-filling \n\nThe logic of gap-filling of demographic data has been summarized in table 2.1. Data on causes of death \nfrom the first available year (2011) is used for 2005. Data on number of deaths and life expectancy are \navailable for most of countries for 2005. For countries for which data on causes of death, number of \ndeaths and/or life expectancy is not available for years 2005 and 2011, gap filling is performed using \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 16 \n\nrelative age distribution numbers of mortality (mortality ratios, or number of deaths per population in \neach age group) and years of life lost (YLL) (YLL ratios) from neighbouring countries with similar socialeconomical characteristics. Original data is used where possible, i.e., if the original life expectancy \nnumbers exist, they are used for calculating YLL ratios, even if mortality ratios have to be gap-filled \n(e.g., for Montenegro and North Macedonia, 2005). \n \nSimilarly, as 2019 data on causes of deaths, death numbers and life expectancy are still not available \nin Eurostat, relative age distribution numbers of mortality (mortality ratios) and YLL (YLL ratios) are \nused from the last available year, as specified in table 2.1. \n \n\nTable 2.1 Logic of gap filling of demographic data \n\nData set \nHealth risk \nassessment \nyear \n\nCountry \nData used for \ngap filling \n\nYear \n of data \nused for \ngap filling \n\nCountry  \nof data used for gap \nfilling \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2005 \nEU27 + (IS, LI, NO, RS, \nCH, UK) \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2011 \nEU27 + (IS, LI, NO, RS, \nCH,UK) \n\nCauses \n of death \n\n2005 AL, BA, ME, MK, XK, \nMortality \nratios \n\n2011 RS \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2005 AD, MC \nMortality \nratios \n\n2011 FR \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2005 SM \nMortality \nratios \n\n2011 IT \n\n      \n\nNumber  \nof death \n\n2005 MC \nMortality \nratios \n\n2005 FR \n\nNumber  \nof death \n\n2005 SM \nMortality \nratios \n\n2005 IT \n\n      \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2005 AL, BA, XK, YLL ratios 2005 RS \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2005 AD, MC YLL ratios 2005 FR \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2005 SM YLL ratios 2005 IT \n\n      \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2019 \nEU26 + (IS, LI, NO, \nRS,UK) \n\nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 \nEU26 + (IS, LI, NO, RS, \nUK) \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2019 FR \nMortality \nratios \n\n2016 FR \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2019 CH \nMortality \nratios \n\n2017 CH \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2019 AL, BA, ME, MK, XK, \nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 RS \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2019 AD, MC \nMortality \nratios \n\n2016 FR \n\nCauses  \nof death \n\n2019 SM \nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 IT \n\n      \n\nNumber  \nof death \n\n2019 \nEU27 + (AD, AL, IS, LI, \nME, MK, NO, RS, CH, \nUK, XK) \n\nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 \nEU27 + (AD, AL, IS, LI, \nME, MK, NO, RS, CH, \nUK, XK) \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 17 \n\nData set \nHealth risk \nassessment \nyear \n\nCountry \nData used for \ngap filling \n\nYear \n of data \nused for \ngap filling \n\nCountry  \nof data used for gap \nfilling \n\nNumber \n of death \n\n2019 BA \nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 RS \n\nNumber  \nof death \n\n2019 MC \nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 FR \n\nNumber  \nof death \n\n2019 SM \nMortality \nratios \n\n2018 IT \n\n      \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2019 \nEU27 + (AL, IS, LI, ME, \nMK, NO, RS, CH, UK) \n\nYLL ratios 2018 \nEU27 + (AL, IS, LI, ME, \nMK, NO, RS, CH, UK) \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2019 BA, XK, YLL ratios 2018 RS \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2019 AD, MC YLL ratios 2018 FR \n\nLife \nexpectancy \n\n2019 SM YLL ratios 2018 IT \n\n \nNote:  \nAD: Andorra; AL: Albania; BA: Bosnia and Herzegovina; CH: Switzerland; EU-26: EU-27 except France (France is \ntreated separately for causes of death 2019, since no 2017-2018 data were available at the time of calculations); \nFR: France; IS: Iceland; IT: Italy; LI: Liechtenstein; MC: Monaco; ME: Montenegro; MK: North Macedonia; NO: \nNorway; RS: Serbia; SM: San Marino; UK: United Kingdom; XK: Kosovo, under UN Security Council Resolution \n1244/99. \nYLL: years of life lost. \n\n \n \n\n2.4 Concentration response functions and counterfactual concentrations \n\nThe impacts on mortality attributable to exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 in Europe presented in this \nreport are based on two different mortality endpoints: \n \n\n\u2022 attributed premature deaths (PD): deaths that occur before a person reaches an expected \nage. This expected age is typically the life expectancy for a country stratified by sex and age. \nPremature deaths are considered preventable If their causes can be eliminated.  \n\n\u2022 years of life lost (YLL): the years of potential life lost as a result of premature deaths. It is an \nestimate of the average number of years that a person would have lived if they had not died \nprematurely (for additional information see, for instance, EEA,2020). \n\n \nThe concentration-response relationship and the population at risk have been selected following the \nrecommendations from the Health Risks of Air Pollution in Europe (HRAPIE) project (WHO, 2013a). For \nchronic exposure to PM2.5, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered in people aged over 30 years for \nall concentrations (i.e., concentrations above 0 \u03bcg/m3), assuming a linear increase in the risk of \nmortality of 6.2 % for a 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5. For chronic exposure to NO2, all-cause (natural) \nmortality is considered in people aged over 30 for concentrations above 20 \u03bcg/m3, assuming a linear \nincrease in the risk of mortality of 5.5 % for a 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in NO2. For acute exposure to O3, allcause (natural) mortality is considered for all ages, assuming a linear increase in the risk of mortality \nof 0.29 % for a 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in O3 values over 35 ppb. A detailed description of the methodology \ncan be found in ETC/ATM (2017a); EEA (2018) and ETC/ATNI (2020a). \n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 18 \n\nThe relative risks described in the previous paragraph have an uncertainty that is expressed as \nconfidence intervals (CIs). These CIs provide the upper and lower boundaries of the 95 % CI of the \nestimate, considering only the uncertainty in the relative risks. These CIs are 4.0-8.3 % for PM2.5, 3.18.0 % for NO2 and 0.14-0.43 % for O3. \n \nQuantifications of health impacts are done individually for these air pollutants, and they cannot be \nadded together, as they exhibit some degree of correlation \u2014 positive or negative. For example, when \nadding together the results for PM2.5 and NO2, this may lead to the double counting of the effects of \nNO2 up to 30 % (WHO, 2013a). \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 19 \n\n3 Health risk assessment in Europe for 2019 \n\nThis chapter presents the results of the health impact calculations in 2019. The presentation follows \nthe same format as in the previous Air quality in Europe reports (EEA, 2020) and the input data and \nmethodology have been explained in the previous sections.  \n \n\n3.1 Health impacts, results for 2019 \n\nTables 3.1 and 3.2 show the results of the health impact calculations for 2019 related to PM2.5, NO2, \nand O3 exposure for 41 European countries. These tables show the total country population, the \npopulation-weighted mean concentrations and the estimated number of attributable premature \ndeaths (Table 3.1), the number of years of life lost (YLL) and the YLL per 100 000 inhabitants (Table 3.2) \nattributed to exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 concentration levels in 2019. \n \nIn the 41 countries listed, 373 000 premature deaths are attributed to PM2.5 exposure, 47 700 to NO2 \nexposure and 19 070 to O3 exposure. In the EU-28, the premature deaths attributed to PM2.5, NO2 and \nO3 exposure are 340 000, 46 200 and 17 680, respectively. Finally, in the EU-27, 307 000, 40 400 and \n16 800 premature deaths are attributed to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 exposure. \n \nIn line with the changes in concentrations, the estimated deaths attributable to PM2.5 and NO2 went \non decreasing in relation to previous years. Those attributed to PM2.5 are 10-11 % lower than those \nestimated for 2018, while those for NO2 decreased slightly more, by 13-16%. In contrast, for O3 the \ndecrease was of 7-9 % confirming, after the increase in 2018 compared to 2017, the high interannual \nvariability and the lack of a real tendency. \n \nIn the 41 countries assessed, 4 068 000 YLL are attributed to PM2.5 exposure, 512 800 to NO2 exposure, \nand 215 100 to O3 exposure (Table 3.2). In the EU-28, the YLL attributed to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 exposure \nare 3 726 000, 497 500, and 200 000, respectively. Finally, in the EU-27, 3 370 000, 435 600 and 190 \n000 YLL are attributed to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 exposure. \n        \nThe largest absolute health impacts in terms of premature deaths and YLL attributable to air pollution \nare estimated for the countries with some of the largest populations. However, in relative terms, i.e., \nwhen considering YLL per 100 000 inhabitants, the outcome can be quite different. \n \nFor PM2.5, largest absolute health impacts are estimated for, in order of decreasing rank, Germany, \nItaly, Poland, the United Kingdom and France (Table 3.1 and map 3.1). When considering YLL per 100 \n000 inhabitants, the largest relative impacts are observed in central and eastern European countries \nwhere the highest concentrations of PM2.5 are also observed, namely, in order of decreasing rank, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. The smallest relative impacts \nare found in countries situated in the north and north-west of Europe, namely, in order of increasing \nrank, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Ireland. \n \nFor NO2, the largest absolute impacts from exposure are seen, in order of decreasing rank, in Italy, \nSpain, Germany, the United Kingdom and France. When considering YLL per 100 000 inhabitants, the \nhighest rates are found in, in order of decreasing rank, Greece, Romania, Italy, Bulgaria and Spain. The \nsmallest relative impacts are found in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and \nSweden, with barely any impact. \n \nRegarding O3, the countries with the largest absolute impacts are, in order of decreasing rank, \nGermany, Italy, France, Spain and Poland.

In the results presented for 2019, the uncertainties in \nhealth outcomes (expressed as 95 % CIs) are estimated as follows: \n \n\n\u2022 for the EU-27 estimates of attributable premature deaths, 203 000-401 000 for PM2.5, 23 30057 400 for NO2 and 8 130-24 870 for O3; and for the YLL: 2 228 000-4 409 000 for PM2.5, 251 \n500-618 400 for NO2, and 91 900-281 300 for O3. \n\n\u2022 for the EU-28 estimates of attributable premature deaths, 225 000-445 000 for PM2.5, 26 70065 600 for NO2 and 8 550-26 170 for O3; and for the YLL: 2 463 000-4 877 000 for PM2.5, 287 \n100-706 500 for NO2, and 96 700-296 100 for O3.  \n\n\u2022 for the 41 European countries estimates of attributable premature deaths, 247 000-488 000 \nfor PM2.5, 27 500-67 700 for NO2 and 9 220-28 220 for O3; and for the YLL: 2 691 000-5 322 000 \nfor PM2.5, 295 900-728 500 for NO2, and 104 000-318 400 for O3. \n\n \n\n3.2 Sensitivity analysis of the health impact estimates in 2019 \n\nThe recommendations from the Health risks of air pollution in Europe (HRAPIE) report (WHO, 2013a) \nindicate that the quantification of long-term effects of PM2.5, NO2 and O3 should be estimated for all \nconcentration levels, annual levels above 20 \u03bcg/m3 and concentrations above 35 parts per billion (ppb), \nrespectively. The results in the previous section followed those recommendations. \n \nTo assess how sensitive the estimations are, additional calculations were undertaken following the \nsame methodology as described in previous sections but with different starting thresholds (or \ncounterfactual concentrations). Table 3.3 summarises the estimated health impacts in 2019 of \nconcentrations equal to or above 2.5 and 10 \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, and of SOMO10 \n(the annual average of daily maximum running 8-hour average O3 concentrations above 10 ppb) for \nO3. These values should be compared with the values in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. The rationale for choosing \n2.5 \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5 is that the European PM2.5 background concentration level is estimated to be, on \naverage, 2.5 \u03bcg/m3 (ETC/ACM, 2017b). For NO2, Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (2012) showed an increase in \nall-cause mortality when NO2 concentrations were lower than 20 \u03bcg/m3, with 10 \u03bcg/m3 being the \nlowest value observed affecting their study participants. Finally, for O3, the HRAPIE project (WHO, \n2013a) recommends using SOMO10 as an alternative to the assessment of only SOMO35. The Review \nof evidence on health aspects of air pollution (REVIHAAP) (WHO, 2013b) also suggests that there is no \nspecific threshold for effects and that small O3 concentrations might affect human health. \n \nThe number of premature deaths and YLL attributable to PM2.5 exposure when including the full range \nof concentration for PM2.5 (Tables 3.1 and 3.2) is around 25 % higher than the estimations based on \nconcentrations equal to or above 2.5 \u03bcg/m3 (Table 3.3). For NO2, the estimations considering only \nconcentrations above 20 \u03bcg/m3 (Tables 3.1 and 3.2) are more than four times lower than when \nassuming a threshold of 10 \u03bcg/m3 (Table 3.3). The results in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 indicate that in many \ncountries concentrations do not exceed 20 \u03bcg/m3 and, therefore, the estimations of premature deaths \nand YLL attributable to NO2 above that concentration are zero. Finally, for O3, estimating health effects \nbased on SOMO10 provides a number of premature deaths and YLL that are about four times higher \nthan an estimation based on SOMO35 \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 25 \n\n \n\nTable 3.3: Estimated number of premature deaths and years of life lost attributable to PM2.5 (from a \nconcentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/m3), NO2 (from a concentration of 10 \u00b5g/m3) and O3 (for \nSOMO10), reference year 2019 \n\n Pollutant and concentration threshold \n\n PM2.5 NO2 O3  \n2.5 \u00b5g/m3 10 \u00b5g/m3 SOMO10 \n\nEU-27    \n Premature \ndeaths \n\n245 000 166 300 67 930 \n\n Years of life lost  2 695 000 1 800 700 771 900  \n              YLL/100 000 inh. 610 407 175 \n\nEU-28 \n \n\n   \n Premature \ndeaths \n\n 270 000  193 200  75 180 \n\n Years of life lost  2 962 000  2 090 700  854 200 \n              YLL/100 000 inh. 582 411 168 \n\nTotal \n \n\n   \n\n Premature \ndeaths \n\n298 000  205 300  80 640 \n\n Years of life lost \n              YLL/100 000 inh. \n\n3 254 000 \n602  \n\n2 216 600 \n410  \n\n913 400  \n169 \n\n \n\nNote: Totals for the EU-27 Member States (\u2018EU-27\u2019), EU-27 Member States and the United Kingdom (\u2018EU-28\u2019),  \n\nand 41 European countries (\u2018Total\u2019). \n\n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 26 \n\n4 Distance to the health-related objective of the Zero Pollution Action Plan \n\nThe Zero Pollution Action Plan (EU, 2021), published in June 2021 as a part of the European Green Deal \n(EU, 2019), has the vision for 2050 that air, water and soil pollution is reduced to levels no longer \nconsidered harmful to health and natural ecosystems and that respect the boundaries our planet can \ncope with, thus creating a toxic-free environment. It has set, inter alia, the target to reduce by 2030 \nthe number of premature deaths caused by PM2.5 by 55%, relative to 2005. \n \nIn this section we will analyse the EU progress towards that target. For that, we will first present the \nhealth impact calculations in 2005, similarly as the analysis presented for 2019 in Section 3.1.

The change in 2019 is \ngiven as a percentage of the original value in 2005.  \n \nAs shown in Table 4.4, the number of premature deaths attributed to exposure to PM2.5 in the EU-27 \nhas decreased from 2005 to 2019 by 33 %, and in all countries, by 31 %. Although it is still far from the \n55 % set as objective in the ZPAP, the progression seems in good track, as explained in section 4.4. All \ncountries have seen a decrease in the number of deaths attributed to exposure to PM2.5, with the only \nexceptions of Ireland and San Marino, that registered the same number in both years. The highest \ndecreases, above 40 %, are found, in order of decreasing rank, in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Portugal, \nRomania, Estonia, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. The smallest ones, below 20 % but in all cases \nabove 10 %, in, in order of increasing rank, Montenegro, Poland, the United Kingdom and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.  \n \nIn the case of NO2, premature deaths have decreased by two thirds in both the EU-27 and all the \ncountries. Some countries have totally reduced the number of premature deaths attributed to \nexposure to NO2, as is the case of Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, San Marino and Sweden. \nSome other countries, where the PD were negligible already in 2005, have continued the same, as \nAndorra, Estonia, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Finally, some countries have increased the number of PD \nattributed to exposure to NO2, such as Cyprus, Kosovo, Serbia and Romania; but in most of these cases \nthe total number of PD is still low and could be due to the uncertainties of the calculations. \n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 31 \n\nFinally, for O3, the picture is quite mixed, and it reflects the high interannual variability of O3 \nconcentrations. Considering EU-27 and all countries, the number of premature deaths in 2019 have \nslightly increased by 4 % and 3 %, respectively. When looking at individual countries, increases of 50 % \nor more can be seen in, in order of decreasing rank, Ireland and Denmark (but with very low number \nof deaths, so the increase can be attributed to the uncertainties of the calculations) and decreases \namong 30 % and 40 % in, in order of decreasing rank, Kosovo, Portugal, Romania and North Macedonia. \nFurthermore, six countries (Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia) have \nexperienced no changes; together with five more where the numbers have continued to be negligible \n(Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino). \n \n\nTable 4.4: Premature deaths attributed to exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 in years 2005 and 2019 \nand relative change between both years  \n\n PM2.5 NO2 O3 \n\nCountry  2005 2019 % change 2005 2019 % change 2005 2019 % change \n\nAustria  7 700 5 200 -32.5 1 890 550 -70.9 330 360 9.1 \n\nBelgium  10 100 6 500 -35.6 3 880 750 -80.7 230 270 17.4 \n\nBulgaria  17 400 10 600 -39.1 1 290 1 120 -13.2 400 290 -27.5 \n\nCroatia  6 500 4 200 -35.4 650 170 -73.8 250 240 -4.0 \n\nCyprus  1 100 700 -36.4 30 130 333.3 50 40 -20.0 \n\nCzechia  13 100 8 500 -35.1 1 290 190 -85.3 470 460 -2.1 \n\nDenmark  3 700 2 900 -21.6 340 < 1 -100 100 150 50.0 \n\nEstonia  900 500 -44.4 < 1 < 1 NA 30 30 0 \n\nFinland  2 400 1 500 -37.5 140 < 1 -100 90 90 0 \n\nFrance  44 700 29 800 -33.3 14 620 4 970 -66.0 1 800 2 050 13.9 \n\nGermany  76 800 53 800 -29.9 22 090 6 000 -72.8 2 560 3 350 30.9 \n\nGreece  15 800 10 400 -34.2 4 880 2 310 -52.7 630 650 3.2 \n\nHungary  16 900 10 400 -38.5 1 700 880 -48.2 550 440 -20.0 \n\nIreland  1 300 1 300 0 80 30 -62.5 30 50 66.7 \n\nItaly  75 100 49 900 -33.6 34 890 10 640 -69.5 3 350 3 170 -5.4 \n\nLatvia  2 600 1 600 -38.5 230 < 1 -100 50 50 0 \n\nLithuania  3 400 2 500 -26.5 110 < 1 -100 100 90 -10.0 \n\nLuxembourg  300 200 -33.3 110 20 -81.8 10 10 0 \n\nMalta  400 300 -25.0 50 < 1 -100 20 20 0 \n\nNetherlands  12 900 8 900 -31.0 5 740 1 000 -82.6 260 380 46.2 \n\nPoland  43 800 39 300 -10.3 3 480 1 190 -65.8 1 320 1 370 3.8 \n\nPortugal  9 600 4 900 -49.0 1 680  540 -67.9 430 270 -37.2 \n\nRomania  38 900 21 500 -44.7 3 300 3 660 10.9 950 640 -32.6 \n\nSlovakia  6 400 4 200 -34.4 180 10 -94.4 230 190 -17.4 \n\nSlovenia  2 100 1 400 -33.3 200 40 -80.0 90 90 0 \n\nSpain  37 000 23 300 -37.0 14 980 6 250 -58.3 1 690 1 820 7.7 \n\nSweden  5 000 2 800 -44.0 200 < 1 -100 170 220 29.4 \n\nAlbania  6 100 4 000 -34.4 530 160 -69.8 250 180 -28.0 \n\nAndorra  50 40 -20.0 < 1 < 1 NA < 1 < 1 NA \nBosnia and Herzegovina  7 300 5 900 -19.2 240 140 -41.7 270 280 3.7 \n\nIceland  100 50 -50.0 < 1 < 1 NA < 1 < 1 NA \n\nKosovo  4 500 2 800 -37.8 50 180 260.0 150 90 -40.0 \n\nLiechtenstein  20 10 -50.0 < 1 < 1 NA < 1 < 1 NA \n\nMonaco  30 20 -33.3 20 10 -50.0 < 1 < 1 NA \n\nMontenegro  1 000 900 -10.0 60 10 -83.3 50 40 -20.0 \n\nNorth Macedonia  5 600 3 400 -39.3 440 120 -72.7 130 90 -30.8 \n\nNorway  2 100 1 200 -42.9 440 30 -93.2 60 80 33.3 \n\nSan Marino  30 30 0 10 < 1 -100 < 1 < 1 NA \n\nSerbia  16 700 11 400 -31.7 260 660 153.8 430 320 -25.6 \n\nSwitzerland  5 400 3 200 -40.7 1 640 170 -89.6 260 300 15.4 \n\nUnited Kingdom  39 700 33 100 -16.6 20 390 5 750 -71.8 700 880 25.7 \n\nEU-27 456 000 307 000 -33 118 000 40 400 -66 16 170 16 800 4 \n\nEU-28  495 000 340 000 -31 138 400 46 200 -67 16 870 17 680 5 \n\nTotal  544 000 373 000 -31 142 100 47 700 -66 18 470 19 070 3 \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 32 \n\nNotes:  the change is expressed as percentage of the original numbers in 2005, according to the formula: \nChange 2019 vs 2005 = 100 * (PD2019 \u2013 PD2005) / PD2005, where \u201cPD\u201d are premature deaths. \n\n \nChanges at country level are rounded to one decimal.

What we present in the current section is the time evolution, for EU-27, of \nthe premature deaths for all years from 2005 on for which either the ETC/ATNI (and its predecessors) \nor the EEA have made calculations.  \n \nFigure 4.1 shows the time evolution in the number of premature deaths in EU-27 attributed to \nexposure to PM2.5 and the distance to the 2030 target set in the ZPAP. The number of premature deaths \nshows a steady decrease along the years, with a punctual increase in 2013. Should air quality continue \nto improve, and the number of premature deaths per year continue to fall at a comparable rate in the \nfuture, then the target would be achieved by 2032, as shown by the dashed line in figure 4.1 \n \nFigures 4.2 and 4.3 show the time evolution of the premature deaths in EU-27 for the exposure to NO2 \nand O3, respectively. For NO2 the decrease is steady although not constant along the years. For O3, the \ntime series shows constants up and downs as a reflection of the high interannual variation of the O3 \nconcentrations and no tendency can be inferred. \n \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 33 \n\nFigure 4.1: Premature deaths attributable to PM2.5, EU-27, 2005-2019 and distance to the ZPAP \ntarget \n\n \nNotes:  \nBlue continuous line: premature deaths attributed to PM2.5.

The changes found can therefore be \nattributed to changes in the concentrations but also to changes in the demographic data, such as \npopulation amount, distribution of this population in the country and mortality data. To consider the \nchange attributed exclusively to changes in the concentrations of the air pollutants, the \u201creal\u201d situation \nin 2005 should be compared with another situation where all the input variables remain the same \n(those in 2005) and the only variation occurs for the concentration, for which the 2019 values are \nconsidered.  \n \nTable 4.5 shows the hypothetical mortality attributed to the population in 2005 due to exposure to air \npollution if the levels in 2005 had been those of 2019.   \n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 36 \n\nTable 4.5: Premature deaths attributable to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 exposure in the EU-27 (current \nmembership), the EU-28 (until 31 January 2020) and 41 European countries, using \npopulation and other demographic data for 2005 and the 2019 concentrations \n\n  PM2.5  NO2  O3  \n    \n\nCountry  Population \n(1\u202f000)  \n\nAnnual \nmean\u202f(a)  \n\nPremature \ndeaths\u202f(b)  \n\nAnnual \nmean\u202f(a)  \n\nPremature \ndeaths\u202f(b)  SOMO35\u202f(a)  Premature \n\ndeaths\u202f(b)  \nAustria  8 201 11.3 4 700 16.4 500 5 802 330 \n\nBelgium  10 446 11 6 200 18.5 700 3 337 260 \n\nBulgaria  7 689 18 10 600 18.6 1 120 3 513 290 \n\nCroatia  4 311 14.7 4 100 14.3 160 6 155 240 \n\nCyprus  1 015 14.7 600 20.9 120 5 645 30 \n\nCzechia  10 199 13.8 8 000 14.2 170 5 400 430 \n\nDenmark  5 411 9.4 2 700 9.1 < 1 3 472 140 \n\nEstonia  1 359 5.5 500 7.5 < 1 2 736 30 \n\nFinland  5 237 5 1 400 8.2 < 1 2 292 90 \n\nFrance  60 776 9.5 27 000 15.2 4 520 4 788 1 870 \n\nGermany  82 501 10.1 48 000 17.5 5 350 4 612 3 000 \n\nGreece  10 970 15.8 9 600 19.2 2 150 7 054 600 \n\nHungary  10 098 14.5 10 100 16.6 860 4 473 430 \n\nIreland  4 112 7.7 1 200 10.5 30 2 119 50 \n\nItaly  57 875 14.5 47 200 20 10 070 6 657 3 010 \n\nLatvia  2 250 10.1 1 600 10.4 < 1 2 547 50 \n\nLithuania  3 355 12.1 2 600 11 < 1 3 220 90 \n\nLuxembourg   461 8.1  200 18.4 20 3 807 10 \n\nMalta  403 12.2  200 11.5 < 1 5 878 20 \n\nNetherlands  16 306 10.7 7 900 19.1 890 3 331 340 \n\nPoland  38 174 17.6 34 900 14.2 1 060 4 390 1 230 \n\nPortugal  9 984 8.3 4 500 14.9 490 3 327 250 \n\nRomania  21 382 15.1 20 600 19.5 3 510 3 221 610 \n\nSlovakia  5 373 14.5 3 900 13.5 10 4 778 180 \n\nSlovenia  1 998 13.2 1 300 14.3 30 5 754 80 \n\nSpain  41 315 10.2 20 900 18.6 5 620 5 818 1 640 \n\nSweden  9 011 5.4 2 700 8 < 1 3 143 210 \n\nAlbania  3 020 17.5 4 000 15.2 160 5 727 180 \n\nAndorra   77 10.8  40 20 < 5 7 535 <.51 \n\nBosnia and Herzegovina  3 843 21.6 6 100 14.3 150 7 068 290 \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 37 \n\n  PM2.5  NO2  O3  \n    \n\nCountry  Population \n(1\u202f000)  \n\nAnnual \nmean\u202f(a)  \n\nPremature \ndeaths\u202f(b)  \n\nAnnual \nmean\u202f(a)  \n\nPremature \ndeaths\u202f(b)  SOMO35\u202f(a)  Premature \n\ndeaths\u202f(b)  \nIceland  294 4  40 11.2 < 1 1 620 < 1 \n\nKosovo  2 041 20.1 3 100 17.5 190 4 378 90 \n\nLiechtenstein  35 8.1 10 16.5 <  5 727 < 1 \n\nMonaco  33 12.9 20 24.1 10 6 930 < 1 \n\nMontenegro  613 18.5 900 14.9 10 6 009 40 \n\nNorth Macedonia  2 035 20.6 3 100 18 110 4 038 90 \n\nNorway  4 606 5.5 1 200 9.8 30 2 696 80 \n\nSan Marino  30 13 20 15.8 < 1 5 956 < 1 \n\nSerbia  7 456 20.8 11 500 17.9 670 4 089 320 \n\nSwitzerland  7 415 8.7 3 000 16.7 160 5 847 270 \n\nUnited Kingdom 60 203 9.7 29 800 \n18.7 5 180 \n\n1 886 790 \n\nEU-27 430 209 11.9 283 000 16.7 37 400 4 827 15 490 \n\nEU-28  490 412 11.7 313 000 16.9 42 600 4 454 16 280 \n\nTotal  521 909 11.8 346 000 16.8 44 000 4 478 17 660 \n\nNotes: \n\n(a) The annual mean (in \u03bcg/m3) and the SOMO35 (in \u03bcg/m3\u00b7days), expressed as population-weighted mean \nconcentration in 2019, are obtained according to the methodology described by ETC/ATNI (2021) and \nreferences therein and not only from monitoring stations. \n\n(b) EU-27, EU-28 and Total values are rounded, after addition, to the nearest thousand for population and \npremature deaths due to PM2.5; to the nearest hundred for NO2; and to the nearest ten for O3.  \n\nThe national totals are rounded to the nearest hundred or ten for PM2.5; and to the nearest ten for NO2 \nand O3. \n\n \nComparing the values in table 4.5 (2005 population data and 2019 concentrations) with those in table \n4.1 (2005 population and concentrations data) we see that, for EU-27, 283 000 premature deaths \nwould have been attributed to exposure to the 2019 pollution levels, instead of the 456 000 attributed \nto the 2005 pollution levels. This means a decrease of 38 % (173 000 premature deaths). For NO2, a \ndecrease of 68 % is estimated (80 600 total PD, from 118 000 to 37 400). Finally, for O3, a decrease \nwould also be seen, of 4 % (680, from 16 170 to 15 490). These numbers indicate that the impact of \nthe improvement of the concentrations have been compensated by the changes in the population \nstructure (for instance, aging population, or migration to urban areas where concentrations tend to be \nhigher). \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 38 \n\n5 Benefit analysis of having reached different air quality standards in 2019 \n\nThis chapter presents a hypothetical assessment of the potential minimum health benefits of meeting \nalready in 2019 and across all Europe the current EU limit values and the World Health Organization \n(WHO) air quality guideline levels and some interim targets (those in place until now and the new \nones), for PM2.5 (1). It provides an updated and extended estimate of a similar exercise that was \nperformed in EEA (2019). \n\nFor this exercise, calculations of premature deaths were made based on the assumption that all PM2.5 \nconcentrations for 2019 over the standard at consideration are set at that standard, while the \nconcentrations below it remain unchanged (2). The rest of the methodology is applied as explained in \nthe previous chapters of this report. It is important to note that the estimated benefits present a \nminimum expected benefit and are likely to be underestimated. This is because measures required to \nbring down concentrations above a certain value would also further reduce concentrations elsewhere \nthat are currently below that value. With the methodology applied, these additional benefits are not \ncaptured and as such, the exercise underestimates the actual expected benefits of reaching the \nconsidered standards or recommendations. However, the measures needed to attain those standards \nare not considered or analysed.

This rounding could affect slightly the \ncalculated differences. \n\n \n\n5.1 Attainment of EU LV \n\nHaving reached in 2019 the current EU limit values for PM2.5 in the EU-27 would have not brought any \nsignificant benefit in terms of health for the Member States. With the current LV only 200 premature \ndeaths would have been avoided. \n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 40 \n\nIf we consider the rest of the countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Serbia would \nhave avoided among 500 and 200 premature deaths \n \nWhen it comes to the EU indicative LV of 20 \u03bcg/m3, the gain is just a bit higher. Bulgaria, Poland, \nCroatia, Italy, Greece and Romania, in order of decreasing rank, would have registered some gains to \nsum up a total 1 % avoided premature deaths in the EU. For the rest of countries, apart for the ones \nmentioned above, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania would have avoided some deaths to sum up a \ntotal of 1.7 % of the estimated deaths in 2019.  \n \nThis is the case because, as can be seen in Map 2.4, there are very few areas with concentrations above \n20 \u03bcg/m3  located int the countries mentioned above. \n \n\n5.2 Attainment of WHO standards \n\nIn an exercise in which all concentrations were equal to or below the 2005 WHO AQG level for PM2.5 \n(10 \u03bcg/m3), premature deaths in the EU\u201127 would decrease by 21 %, while premature deaths in the 41 \nEuropean countries would decrease by 22 % when compared with the actual results for 2019. \nConsequently, it is estimated that the EU-27 and all the 41 European countries would have benefits of \n65 300 and 80 600 fewer premature deaths, respectively, when compared with the status in 2019.  \n\nThe benefits would be higher in those countries where concentrations are well above the 2005 WHO \nAQG level for PM2.5 compared to countries where concentrations are below or slightly above the WHO \nAQG level for PM2.5. Specifically out of the EU-27, Bulgaria, Poland, Greece, Romania, Malta, Croatia, \nSlovakia, Italy and Hungary, in order of decreasing rank, would see reductions of more than or around \n30%. And in the case of the other countries, in order of decreasing rank, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North \nMacedonia and Serbia would, at least, have halved their number of premature deaths, while Kosovo, \nMontenegro, Albania and San Marino would have reduced them more than 30 %. \n\nOn the contrary the MS of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Sweden and the countries \nof Andorra Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland would barely get any benefit, \nsince practically all their territory shows concentrations below 10 \u03bcg/m3. \n\nNevertheless, the 241 400 premature deaths estimated in case of having reached the 2005 WHO AQG \nlevel are higher than 205 200, which is the target set in the ZPAP (figure 4.1) for 2030 and therefore it \nmight have not been enough to reach that target already in 2019 (see 4.4). \n\nWhen considering the new proposed AQG level of 5 \u03bcg/m3, the benefits would be higher. For the EU27, the number of premature deaths would more than halve (a decrease of 58 %), decreasing from the \nactual 306 700 to the new estimated 129 400 (a total 177 300 avoided premature deaths, reaching in \nthis case by far already in 2019, the target of a maximum of 205 200 premature deaths as set in the \nZPAP target for 2030).  \n\nThe relative figures are similar considering all the 41 countries. For the total, having achieved the new \nAQG level would have implied the same reduction of 58 % in the premature deaths, with a total \nnumber of 215 900 avoided premature deaths (from 372 800 to 156 900). \n\nIn this case, for the EU-27 the highest decreases (more than 60 %) would have been observed, in order \nof decreasing rank, in Cyprus, Bulgaria, Poland, Greece, Malta, Romania, Italy, Hungary, Croatia, \nSlovakia and Czechia. Considering all countries in order of decreasing rank, the numbers in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Kosovo and Serbia would be as low as, at least, one quarter of the premature deaths in \n2019, and decreases would also be above 60 % in North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and San \nMarino.  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 41 \n\nFurthermore, almost every country would gain avoided premature deaths, with the only exception of \nIceland and Liechtenstein, with very favourable concentrations and exposure already below 5 \u03bcg/m3.  \n\nMap 5.1 shows the premature deaths by country, should the 2021 WHO AQG level of 5 \u03bcg/m3 be \nattained in all areas with current concentrations above that level. Map 5.2 shows the decrease in the \nnumber of premature deaths compared with the current 2019 situation. \n\n \n\nMap 5.1: Absolute premature deaths attributable to PM2.5, at country level, in 2019, should the \n2021 WHO AQG level of 5 \u03bcg/m3 be attained in all areas with current concentrations \nabove that level \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 42 \n\nMap 5.2: Health benefit, in terms of percentage of premature deaths avoided, at country level, in \n2019, should the 2021 WHO PM2.5 AQG level of 5 \u03bcg/m3 be attained in all areas with \ncurrent concentrations above that level \n\n \n  \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2021/10 43 \n\n6 References \n\nChen, J. and Hoek, G., 2020, Long-term exposure to PM and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: \nA systematic review and meta-analysis, Environment International,  ( 105974), \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105974. \n \nEEA, 2018, Assessing the risks to health from air pollution, EEA briefing \n(https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/assessing-the-risks-to-health/assessing-the-risks-tohealth) accessed 14 July 2021. \n \nEEA, 2019, Ari quality in Europe \u2013 2019 report, EEA Report No 10/2019 \n(https://www.eea.europa.eu//publications/air-quality-in-europe-2019) accessed 14 July 2021. \n \nEEA, 2020, Air quality in Europe report series \n(https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications#c7=en&c11=5&c14=air-quality-reports&c12=&b_start=0) \naccessed 7 July 2021. \n \nETC/ACM, 2017a, Quantifying the health impacts of ambient air pollution: methodology and input \ndata, ETC/ACM Technical Paper 2016/5 (https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-atni/products/etcatni-reports/etcacm_tp_2016_5_aq_hia_methodology) accessed 7 July 2021. \n \nETC/ACM,  2017b, European air quality maps for 2014 \u2014 PM10  PM2.5  ozone  NO2 and NOX spatial \nestimates and their uncertainties, Technical Paper 2016/6 European Topic Centre on Air Pollution and \nClimate Change Mitigation (https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-atni/products/etc-atnireports/etcacm_tp_2016_6_aqmaps2014) accessed 15 July 2021. \n \nETC/ATNI, 2018, European air quality maps for 2015, ETC/ACM Technical Paper 2017/7 \n(https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-atni/products/etc-atnireports/etcacm_tp_2017_7_aqmaps2015) accessed 14 July 2021. \n \nETC/ATNI, 2020a, Health Risk Assessment of Air Pollution in Europe.

Heart disease and stroke are the most common reasons for premature deaths attributable to air pollution, followed by lung diseases and lung cancer. This chapter estimates the potential health benefits of attaining the EU air quality standards and the WHO guideline values for fine particulate matter in ambient air. It also assesses progress towards the health-related objective of the EU\u2019s Zero Pollution Action Plan. Finally, it presents the latest estimates of the health impacts of exposure to the following key air pollutants: fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone.\nHealth impacts of air pollution in Europe, 2021 is part of the Air quality in Europe 2021 report.\nIn 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) published new air quality guidelines, updating the 2005 air quality guidelines on the basis of a systematic review of the latest scientific evidence of how air pollution damages human health.\nThe European Union (EU) has also set standards for key air pollutants in the ambient air quality directives. Where levels exceed these standards, Member States should prepare an air quality plan or programme to address the sources responsible and ensure compliance. Although these values were based on the 2005 WHO air quality guidelines, they also reflect the technical and economic feasibility of their attainment across EU Member States. The EU air quality standards are therefore less demanding than the WHO air quality guidelines.\nUnder the European Green Deal\u2019s Zero Pollution Action Plan, the European Commission set the 2030 goal of reducing the number of premature deaths caused by PM2.5 by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels. To this end, the European Commission initiated a revision of the ambient air quality directives, aiming to align the air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations. The revision also aims to strengthen provisions on air quality monitoring and modelling, and on the development of air quality plans to help local authorities achieve cleaner air. In parallel, stricter requirements are also foreseen to tackle air pollution at source, such as from agriculture, industry, transport, buildings and energy.\nThis chapter directly supports the revision of EU air quality rules by providing a preliminary analysis of the health benefits of moving closer to WHO recommendations on air quality in the EU. It also assesses progress towards the Zero Pollution Action Plan target of reducing the health impacts of air pollution by more than 55% by 2030.\nThe new WHO air quality guidelines reflect concentrations of key air pollutants above which adverse health effects are known to occur. They offer quantitative health-based recommendations for air quality management and provide an evidence-based tool for policy makers working on air quality. The guidelines also include \u2018interim targets\u2019 \u2014 levels associated with a qualified reduction in the risk to health \u2014 that serve to inform the development of pollution reduction policies that are achievable in realistic timeframes in highly polluted areas. WHO recommends that the interim targets be regarded as steps towards the ultimate achievement of air quality guideline levels, rather than as an end goal.\nThe EEA undertook a preliminary assessment of the potential benefits to human health \u2014 in terms of avoided premature deaths \u2014 of reducing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution across the EU to meet limit values established by the EU and guidelines set by WHO in 2021. Annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in 2019 were taken as the point of departure and the following five standards and guideline levels were considered:\nTable 1 describes the minimum health benefits that would have been achieved if, in 2019, all areas in the EU-27 had met the range of air quality concentrations for PM2.5 included in the EU standards and WHO guideline levels. It also shows the percentage change in relation to the situation in 2005, allowing for comparison with the target in the Zero Pollution Action Plan. Table 2 presents the minimum health benefits by country.\nIt is important to note that the assessment assumes that all areas in the EU-27 that were above each standard or guideline for PM2.5 in 2019, had instead reached each respective standard or guideline, while all other areas maintained the concentrations observed in 2019. As such, these estimates represent the minimum benefits that would result from improvements in air quality across the EU. The measures required to bring down concentrations in areas that were above a certain standard or guideline in 2019 would also reduce concentrations in areas already below the respective level, in particular for the WHO interim targets 3 and 4. Additional reductions in premature deaths would therefore also be seen in those areas and these benefits are not captured in this analysis, making it an underestimate of the potential health benefits.\nEU-27\nPremature deaths due to PM2.5\nReduction in premature deaths on 2019 levels\n% reduction in premature deaths on 2019 levels\n% reduction in premature deaths on 2005 levels\n2019 concentrations\n306,700\n-\n-\n33%\nEU limit value\n25 \u00b5g/m3\n306,500\n200\n0%\n33%\nEU indicative limit value\n20 \u00b5g/m3\n303,500\n3,200\n1%\n33%\n2021 WHO interim target 3\n15 \u00b5g/m3\n289,200\n17,500\n6%\n37%\n2021 WHO interim target 4\n(2005 WHO air quality guideline)\n10 \u00b5g/m3\n241,400\n65,300\n21%\n47%\n2021 WHO air quality guideline\n5 \u00b5g/m3\n129,400\n177,300\n58%\n72%\nNote: The WHO interim targets and guidelines are drawn from the updated guidelines published in 2021.\nHad the EU limit value for PM2.5 of 25 \u00b5g/m3 been attained across Europe in 2019, the estimated number of premature deaths would remain unchanged compared to the estimation with the 2019 real concentrations.\nHad the EU indicative limit value of 20 \u00b5g/m3 been attained, only 1% fewer deaths would have been expected in the EU-27 and around 2% fewer across all 41 countries included in the analysis.\nIn contrast, had the WHO interim target 4 for PM2.5 of 10 \u00b5g/m3 been attained everywhere in Europe in 2019, premature deaths would have been at least 21% lower in the EU-27, and 22% lower across all 41 countries.\nFinally, had the new WHO air quality guideline for PM2.5 of 5 \u00b5g/m3 been attained across Europe in 2019, the related premature deaths would have been 58% lower than in 2019 in both the EU-27 and all the European countries considered. Work is ongoing in the context of the revision of the EU ambient air quality directives to determine whether achieving PM2.5 concentrations of 5 \u00b5g/m3 is technically feasible across the EU, given the influence of geographical features in some areas.\nThe Zero Pollution Action Plan sets the target of improving air quality, with a focus on PM2.5, in order to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution in the EU by a minimum of 55%, relative to 2005 levels. The EEA estimates that 456,000 premature deaths were attributable to exposure to PM2.5 in 2005 in the 27 Member States of the EU. Achieving a 55% reduction would imply that premature deaths fell to 205,000 per year.\nIn terms of the past trend, from 2005 to 2019 premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 exposure in the EU 27 fell by 33% to reach 307,000 (see Figure 1). Should air quality continue to improve, and the number of premature deaths per year continue to fall at a comparable rate in the future, then the target would be achieved by 2032, as shown in Figure 1. However, continuously reducing concentrations of particulate matter in ambient air over the next decade will be demanding. To meet the target, Member States will need to fully implement their national air pollution control programmes (NACPCs), as well as measures needed to reach the 2030 climate and energy targets (European Commission, 2021). Furthermore, the trends in aging and urbanisation of the European population counteract some of the health gains associated with the reduction in ambient air pollution concentrations. An older population is more sensitive to air pollution and a higher rate of urbanisation typically means that more people are exposed to PM2.5 concentrations, which tend to be higher in cities.\nNote: To estimate premature deaths, all-cause (natural) mortality is considered in people aged over 30 years for all concentrations, assuming a linear increase in the risk of mortality of 6.2% for a 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5\nThe trend in premature deaths is based on a future projection of the past rate of reduction in premature deaths.\nSource: ETC/ATNI, 2021\nMore info here...\nThe analysis of the potential benefits of meeting different EU limit values and WHO guideline levels indicates that the target to reduce premature deaths by 55% can only be met by lowering concentrations of PM2.5 across the EU to levels comparable to the 2021 WHO air quality guideline.\nHad the WHO interim target 4 for PM2.5 of 10 \u00b5g/m3 (the 2005 WHO air quality guideline) been attained across the EU-27 in 2019, this would have delivered a reduction in premature deaths of at least 47% on 2005 levels (see Figure 2 and Table 1). This would not have been sufficient to meet the Zero Pollution Action Plan target in full in 2019, although it is important to note that this does not capture the benefits of reducing pollution in areas that were already at 10 \u00b5g/m3 or less in 2019.\nHowever, had the new WHO air quality guideline for PM2.5 of 5 \u00b5g/m3 been attained across the EU-27 in 2019, then this would have delivered a reduction in premature deaths of at least 72% compared with 2005 levels (see figure 2).\nBringing PM2.5 concentrations closer to the 2021 WHO air quality guideline would therefore deliver significant health benefits in Europe. EU air quality standards are a crucial policy tool driving improvements in air quality. The closer alignment of EU air quality standards with WHO recommendations would therefore represent an important step towards cleaner air in Europe.\nNote: The graph presents the estimated minimum reduction in premature deaths due to exposure to PM2.5 compared with 2005, had different EU limit values and WHO guidelines for PM2.5 been met in the EU-27 in 2019.\nEstimations of the mortality in 2019 linked to exposure to the air pollutants deemed most harmful for human health are presented in this final section.\nIn 2019 in the EU-27:\nIn 2019 in the 41 European countries considered:\nThe number of premature deaths attributed to air pollution fell in 2019 compared to 2018. The greatest decrease was for NO2, with a reduction of 16% in the associated premature deaths. Premature deaths attributed to exposure to fine particulate matter decreased by 11%, while those attributed to exposure to ozone decreased by 9%.\nTable 3 presents the total country population, the population-weighted mean concentrations, and the estimated number of attributable premature deaths by country.\nTable 4 presents years of life lost (YLL), and the YLL per 100,000 inhabitants associated with exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 concentration levels in 2019.\nThe sections below provide information at country level on the health impacts of key pollutants. For specific information on the pollutants, concentrations and their sources, please see the chapter on Europe\u2019s air quality status 2021 - update.\nAdditional information on the data and the methodology used can be found in the Eionet ETC/ATNI report 10/2021, Health risk assessments of air pollution.\nThe greatest health risks in terms of premature deaths and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to PM2.5 exposure are estimated for the countries with some of the largest populations, namely, in order of decreasing rank, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and France.\nHowever, when considering YLL per 100,000 inhabitants, the most significant impacts are observed in central and eastern European countries (where the highest concentrations of PM2.5 are also observed), namely, in order of decreasing rank, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. The smallest relative impacts are found in countries situated in the north and north-west of Europe, where concentrations are lowest.\nThe greatest health risks in terms of premature deaths and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to NO2 exposure are estimated for the countries with some of the largest populations, namely, in order of decreasing rank, Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and France.\nWhen considering YLL per 100,000 inhabitants, the most significant impacts are observed in, in order of decreasing rank, Greece, Romania, Italy, Bulgaria and Spain. The smallest relative impacts on health are found in the Nordic and Baltic countries.\nThe greatest health risks in terms of total premature deaths and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to O3 exposure were seen for, in order of decreasing rank, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Poland.\nThe countries with the highest rates of YLL per 100,000 inhabitants were, in order of decreasing rank, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Croatia and Greece. The countries with the lowest relative impacts on health from O3 exposure were, in order of increasing rank, Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Norway and Finland.\nSince 2014, the EEA has been estimating mortality due to exposure to air pollution, with support from the EEA European Topic Centres. Mortality is both the most serious health outcome of air pollution, and also the one for which scientific evidence is most robust. To attribute a health risk to exposure to air pollution, concentration-response functions are used. These functions are based on epidemiological studies and estimate the increase in risk per unit of concentration of a certain air pollutant. As an example, the function for fine particles (PM2.5) assumes a linear increase in the risk of mortality of 6.2% for a 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in PM2.5.\nTo date, the EEA has used the risks functions recommended by WHO in 2013. To ensure comparability with our previous studies, the same 2013 functions are used in this chapter. The new 2021 WHO air quality guidelines include new concentration-response functions and the EEA expects to apply these new functions in our assessments from 2022 onwards.\nNote 1: The analysis in this chapter refers to the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU-27), as well as additional European countries, reaching a total of 41 countries.\nThe quantifications of health risks are done individually for the respective air pollutants, and they cannot be added together, as they exhibit some degree of correlation.\nNote 2: Our assessment of potential benefits assumes that all areas in the EU-27 that in 2019 were above each respective standard or guideline for PM2.5 had instead reached each respective standard or guideline, while all other areas maintained the concentrations observed in 2019. As such, these estimates represent the minimum benefits resulting from potential improvements in air quality across the EU, with reductions in premature deaths also likely to be seen in areas where standards and guidelines were already achieved.\nNote 3: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union did not affect the production of this assessment. Data for the United Kingdom appear here in agreement with the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, which entered into force on 1 February 2020. Data reported by the United Kingdom are included in all analyses and assessments contained herein, unless otherwise indicated.\nChapters of the Air quality in Europe 2021 report:\nBack to main page of the report\nHow clean is the air you are breathing right now?

Latest estimates by the European Environment Agency (EEA) show that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) continues to cause the most substantial health impacts.\n\n\n\nMost Europeans live in areas, especially cities, where air pollution can reach high levels. Both short- and long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to a wide range of diseases, including stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trachea, bronchus and lung cancers, aggravated asthma and lower respiratory infections.\u00a0The\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0(WHO) provides evidence of links between exposure to air pollution and type 2 diabetes, obesity, systemic inflammation, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. The\u00a0International Agency for Research on Cancer\u00a0has classified air pollution, in particular PM2.5, as a leading cause of cancer. A recent\u00a0global review\u00a0found that\u00a0chronic exposure can affect every organ in the body, complicating and exacerbating existing health conditions.\r\nHealth impacts of air pollution\r\n\r\nNote: Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM2.5), particulate matter with a diameter of 10\u00a0\u00b5m or less (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and sulphur dioxide (SO2).\r\nSource:\u00a0EEA, \"Healthy environment, healthy lives ,\"\u00a02019\r\nFine particulate matter (PM2.5)\u00a0is the air pollutant driving the most significant health problems and premature mortality. In 2019, PM concentrations exceeded EU limit values in large parts of Europe.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n307,000 premature deaths\r\ndue to fine particulate matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EEA estimates that, in 2019, approximately 307,000 premature deaths were attributable to PM2.5\u00a0in the 27 EU Member States. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was linked to 40,400 premature deaths, and ground-level ozone was linked to 16,800 premature deaths.\u00a0\r\nIn 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) published new\u00a0air quality guidelines to protect human health, updating the\u00a02005 air quality guidelines\u00a0on the basis of a systematic review of the latest scientific evidence of how air pollution damages human health.\r\nThe European Union (EU) also set\u00a0standards\u00a0for key air pollutants in the\u00a0ambient air quality directives. Although these values were based on the 2005 WHO air quality guidelines, they also reflect the technical and economic feasibility of their attainment across EU Member States. The EU air quality standards are therefore less demanding than the WHO air quality guidelines.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPercentage of the urban population in the EU-27 exposed to key air pollutants at levels above EU standards and 2021 WHO guidelines.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nUnder the European Green Deal\u2019s\u00a0Zero Pollution Action Plan, the European Commission set the 2030 goal of reducing the number of premature deaths caused by PM2.5\u00a0by at least 55% compared with 2005 levels. To this end, the European Commission initiated a\u00a0revision of the ambient air quality\u00a0directives, aiming to align the air quality standards more closely with WHO recommendations.\u00a0\r\nIn terms of the past trend, from 2005 to 2019 premature deaths attributed to PM2.5\u00a0exposure in the EU 27 fell by 33% to reach 307,000. Should air quality continue to improve, and the number of premature deaths per year continue to fall at a comparable rate in the future, then the Zero Pollution target would be achieved by 2032, as shown in the figure below.\r\nPremature deaths attributed to PM2.5\u00a0in the EU-27 from 2005-2019, and distance to the target of a 55% reduction in the 2005 levels of premature deaths\r\n\r\nInequalities in exposure and vulnerability to air pollution in Europe\r\nAir pollution affects people in different ways.\u00a0Older people, children and those with pre-existing health conditions are more sensitive to the health impacts of air pollution. In addition, the most deprived people in society often have poorer health and less access to high-quality medical care, increasing their vulnerability.\u00a0\r\nThere is strong evidence linking lower socio-economic status to increased exposure to air pollution. In large parts of Europe,\u00a0poorer people are more likely to live next to busy roads or industrial areas\u00a0and thus, face higher levels of exposure to air pollution. At the same time, exposure patterns vary across European cities. In some cities, wealthier people live in central, polluted areas, while in other European cities central areas are inhabited by poorer communities.\u00a0\r\nIn Europe,\u00a0regions characterised by lower GDP per capita are found to have higher levels of PM2.5\u00a0and tend to occur in Eastern and South-eastern Europe. This pattern is largely driven by the combustion of low-quality solid fuels (e.g. coal and wood) in low-efficiency ovens for domestic heating in those areas. The higher population exposure to PM2.5\u00a0in particular regions, translates into higher numbers of premature deaths attributed to air pollution.\u00a0\r\nMapping mortality attributed to PM2.5 against regional wealth in Europe\r\nThe interactive map viewer shows the spatial distribution of population-weighted concentrations of PM2.5 (as an indication of population exposure) across Europe and the associated mortality. The viewer also allows to display data against GDP per capita as a proxy for the average socio-economic characteristics of the population in each region. The data is presented for NUTS3 regions (between 150\u00a0000 and 800\u00a0000 inhabitants).\r\nTips for using the interactive map viewer\r\n\r\nGDP per capita - Eurostat; Premature deaths, years of life lost and population-weighted concentrations are based on an EEA analysis of interpolated annual statistics of reported monitoring data from 2018 (see Map 9.1 in EEA, 2020) and the Geostat 2011 population grid data set.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther information:\r\n\r\nThe EEA\u2019s latest briefing on the  health impacts of air pollution in Europe\r\nThe EEA\u2019s latest briefing on\u00a0Europe\u2019s air quality status\r\nSources of air pollution\r\nThe concentrations of air pollutants across Europe (see the EEA data viewers on\u00a0Up-to-date air quality data\u00a0and\u00a0Air quality statistics)\r\nThe EU policy framework for Air Quality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplore the EEA data on air pollution\r\n\r\nHow is the COVID-19 pandemic linked to air pollution?\r\n\r\nThe temporary reduction in human activities resulted in lower emissions of some air pollutants. Air quality data reported to the EEA shows that concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) \u2014 a pollutant mainly emitted by road transport \u2014decreased in April 2020 in many European cities, where lockdown measures had been implemented (with large variations among and within cities), relative to business-as-usual scenario. The largest fall in NO2 concentrations (around 70\u00a0%) was seen at traffic air monitoring stations in Spain and Italy. The ongoing fluctuations in NO2 concentrations can be found in our data viewer and in the recent EEA article on COVID-19 and the environment.\r\nPM10 concentrations also tended to be lower in April 2020 compared to business-as-usual scenario.\u00a0The greatest relative reductions (35 \u2013 40\u00a0%) were estimated at traffic stations in Spain and Italy, whilst limited number of sites (mainly rural background stations) recorded increase in PM10 concentrations. The smaller reduction in PM10 concentrations compared to NO2 is due to the PM concentrations being influenced by both primary emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources and by precursor gases emitted from different sources, which can subsequently form PM in the atmosphere.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are two other relationships between air pollution and COVID-19: the possible effect of air pollution on vulnerability and susceptibility to COVID-19 (via previous long-term exposure to air pollutants), and the possible role of air pollution in spreading the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Some very recent studies, some produced in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, have explored those links but they need to be interpreted with care and further research is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nCover image: \u00a9 Jean-Jacques Poirault, ImaginAIR /EEA."]}
