Cutting emissions from transport is pivotal to achieving the EU target of becoming climate neutral by 2050.\nTo support a reduction in GHG emissions from transport, the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) sets the target that fuel suppliers should reduce the emission intensity of fuels sold in the EU by 6 % by 2020, compared with 2010. In 2017, the average emission intensity of fuels in the EU was 3.4 % lower than in 2010, thus failing to meet the indicative target of a 4 % reduction by 2017. In 2018, the average emission intensity of fuels in the EU was 3.7% lower than in 2010, and in 2019, a 4.3% reduction had been achieved. Despite the improvement, as of 2019, the EU was not on track to meet its 2020 target.\nThe decrease in emission intensity of road transport fuels between 2018 and 2019 can be attributed mainly to an increase (from 5.2% to 5.6%) in the proportion of biofuels used, as biofuels have a lower emission intensity than fossil fuels. Also, there was a decrease in the emission intensity of the biofuels used between 2018 and 2019, because of a small decrease in the use of oil crops, which generally have a higher emission intensity than other feedstocks in biofuel production.\nBiofuel use has contributed to a reduction in the GHG emission intensity of road transport in the EU. However, it is important to ensure that rising demand for biofuels does not have a negative impact on land use by displacing the production of food and feed crops and driving the conversion of land \u2014 such as forests and wetlands \u2014 to agricultural land, leading indirectly to increased GHG emissions. This phenomenon is known as indirect land us change (ILUC). The FQD requires that Member States identify the feedstock from which their biofuels originate and estimate emissions resulting from ILUC for certain feedstocks.\nHowever, emissions from ILUC are not considered for assessing compliance with the 6% 2020 reduction target. If ILUC is taken into account, the average GHG emission intensity of fuels consumed in 2019 is only 2.6% lower than in 2010; it decreased between 2018 and 2019 because of the decreased use of oils crops substituted by sugars.\n|Countries||2010-2019 GHG intensity reduction (excl. indirect land use change)||2010-2019 GHG intensity reduction (incl. indirect land use change)||2020 target|\n|Austria||3.2||0.1||6|\n|Belgium||3||0.6||6|\n|Bulgaria||3.7||1.4||6|\n|Croatia||2.5||1.6||6|\n|Cyprus||1.3||1.3||6|\n|Czechia||3.8||1.9||6|\n|Denmark||2.7||0.6||6|\n|Estonia||1.8||1.3||6|\n|Finland||7.7||7.5||6|\n|France||4.5||1||6|\n|Germany||3.8||2.3||6|\n|Greece||3.5||2.2||6|\n|Hungary||3||2.5||6|\n|Ireland||3.5||3.4||6|\n|Italy||3.8||3.3||6|\n|Latvia||1.8||0.5||6|\n|Lithuania||2.2||0.5||6|\n|Luxembourg||3.4||1.1||6|\n|Malta||4.3||4.2||6|\n|Netherlands||5.8||5.6||6|\n|Poland||4.2||1.6||6|\n|Portugal||3.1||2.1||6|\n|Romania||2.8||0.5||6|\n|Slovakia||4||1.7||6|\n|Slovenia||2.9||1.7||6|\n|Spain||3.4||1.2||6|\n|Sweden||18.6||15.2||6|\n|United Kingdom||4.4||4.2||6|\n|EU-27 + UK||4.3||2.6||6|\nProgress towards meeting the 6% reduction target by 2020 varies widely across Member States. In 2019, Finland and Sweden had exceeded this target and the Netherlands was close to reaching it (5.8% reduction). This is because their road transport fuel mixes have relatively high proportions of biofuels (9% in Finland, 7% in the Netherlands and 22% in Sweden) and, on average, the biofuels used have relatively low emission intensities (10.4 g CO2e/MJ, 15.2 g CO2e/MJ and 14.1 g CO2e/MJ, respectively).\nThe three Member States that reduced their emission intensities the least between 2010 and 2019, namely Cyprus (1.4%), Latvia (1.8%) and Estonia (1.8%), use fuel mixes with much lower proportions of biofuels (1.7% in Cyprus, 2.6% in Latvia and 2.8% in Estonia) and, in the case of Latvia, the biofuels used have much higher emission intensities (32 gCO2e/MJ).\nThe effect that ILUC has on reductions in Member States\u2019 emission intensities largely depends on the feedstocks used to produce biofuels.

Between 2010 and 2018, the emission intensity decreased by 3.7 %, mostly due to the increased use of biofuels. Finland and Sweden are the only Member States whose emission intensities decreased by more than 6 %. If the indirect land use change effects of biofuel production are considered, the emission intensity of fuels sold in the EU actually increased between 2017 and 2018, because of the increased use of oil crops as feedstocks.\nFig. 1: Average greenhouse gas intensity of road transport fuels in the EU, 2010-2018\nNote: \u2022 Average EU values (including and excluding indirect land-use change from biofuels production) calculated on the basis of 22 Member States submissions for 2017 (all except Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain) and 28 submissions for 2018. \u2022 gCO2eq/MJ, grams of CO2 equivalents per megajoule of energy produced; GHG, greenhouse gas.\nData source:\nTransport is responsible for more than 25 % of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a major contributor to climate change. Cutting emissions from transport is pivotal to realising the ambition of having net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, as set out in the EU\u2019s long-term strategy (EC, 2020).\nTo support a reduction in GHG emissions from transport, the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) (EC, 1998) sets the target that fuel suppliers should reduce the emission intensity of fuels sold in the EU by 6 % by 2020, compared with 2010. In 2017, the average emission intensity of fuels in the EU was 3.4 % lower than in 2010, thus failing to meet the indicative target of a 4 % reduction by 2017. Even by 2018, a 4 % reduction had not been achieved, with emission intensity only 3.7 % lower than in 2010. The EU is therefore not on track to meet its 2020 target.\nThe decrease in emission intensity of road transport fuels between 2017 and 2018 can be attributed mainly to an increase (from 4.5 % to 5.2 %) in the proportion of biofuels used, as biofuels have a lower emission intensity than fossil fuels. However, there was an increase in the emission intensity of the biofuels used between 2017 and 2018. This partly offset the benefits that could have been achieved, namely a 4 % rather than a 3.7 % reduction in emission intensity by 2018. This increase in biofuel emission intensity was due to an increase in the use of oil crops, which generally have a higher emission intensity than other feedstocks, in biofuel production.\nBiofuel use has contributed to a reduction in the GHG emission intensity of road transport in the EU. However, it is important to ensure that rising demand for biofuels does not have a negative impact on land use by displacing the production of food and feed crops and driving the conversion of land \u2014 such as forests and wetlands \u2014 to agricultural land, leading indirectly to increased GHG emissions. This phenomenon is known as indirect land us change (ILUC). The FQD requires that Member States identify the feedstock from which their biofuels originate and estimate emissions resulting from ILUC for certain feedstocks.\nHowever, emissions from ILUC are not considered for assessing compliance with the 6 % 2020 reduction target. If ILUC is taken into account, the average GHG emission intensity of fuels consumed in 2018 is only 2.1 % lower than in 2010; it even increased between 2017 and 2018 because of the increased use of oils crops.\nFig. 2: Average greenhouse gas intensity of road transport fuels by Member State, 2010-2018\nNote: \u2022 ILUC, indirect land use change. \u2022 The reduction target applies to values that exclude ILUC emissions only.\nData source:\nProgress towards meeting the 2020 6 % reduction target varies widely across Member States. In 2018, Finland and Sweden were the only countries to have exceeded this target. This is because their road transport fuel mixes have relatively high proportions of biofuels (8 % in Finland and 23 % in Sweden) and, on average, the biofuels used have relatively low emission intensities (14 g CO2eq/MJ and 14.5 g CO2eq/MJ, respectively).\nThe two Member States that reduced their emission intensities the least between 2010 and 2018, namely Croatia (0.1 %) and Estonia (0.9 %), use fuel mixes with much lower proportions of biofuels (0.2 % in Croatia and 2.0 % in Estonia) and, in the case of Estonia, the biofuels used have much higher emission intensities (35.1 g CO2eq/MJ).\nThe effect that ILUC has on reductions in Member States\u2019 emission intensities largely depends on the feedstocks used to produce biofuels. Oil crops are used extensively in Estonia and Lithuania and, if ILUC effects are considered, the GHG emission intensity of these biofuels is only marginally lower than diesel produced from fossil fuels (88.9 g CO2eq/MJ versus 95.1 g CO2eq/MJ). As a result, if ILUC is considered, these countries actually increased their road fuel emission intensities between 2010 and 2018.\nEU Member States report annually on the volumes, energy content and life cycle GHG emissions of fuels used in road transport and non-road mobile machinery, in line with their obligations under the Fuel Quality Directive 98/70/EC (FQD) Article 7a.
