To fulfil its obligations under the Montreal Protocol, the EU has adopted the more ambitious EU Ozone Regulation. This online data viewer contains information on ozone-depleting substances in the EU, based on aggregated data reported by companies since 2006 under the Ozone Regulation.\n\n\n\nDownload as pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force. Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The protocol covers around 100 individual substances with a high ozone-depleting potential (ODP), including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as \u2018controlled substances\u2019.\r\nWithin the European Union (EU), the use of and trade in\u00a0substances is reguated by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01005/2009 (known as the Ozone Regulation). This regulation stipulates that all companies producing controlled substances or importing them into and/or exporting them out of the EU, as well as feedstock users, process agent users and destruction facilities, must report their activities concerning controlled substances annually. The Ozone Regulation also encompasses five additional ODS that are not covered by the Montreal Protocol. These \u2018new substances\u2019 are halon 1202, methyl chloride (MC), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and n-propyl bromide (n-PB). Producers, importers and exporters also have to report their activities for these new substances.\r\nThe European Environment Agency (EEA) is responsible for collecting, archiving, checking and aggregating information contained in these company reports. The EEA also supports the companies in fulfilling their reporting obligations. The data reported on production, imports and exports are presented to parties of the Montreal Protocol in order to monitor progress in phasing out ODS in compliance with the Protocol. In 2021, 239 companies reported on their 2020 activities under the Ozone Regulation.\r\nThe EU has already achieved its phase-out goals under the Montreal Protocol and reports on the uses that are still allowed.\r\nThis online data viewer summarises the most recent data reported by companies under the Ozone Regulation and looks at trends since 2006. Data from 2012 onwards were also updated, based on reports resubmitted after the reporting deadlines for these years.\r\nSince the potential to harm the ozone layer varies among substances, results are expressed in both metric tonnes and ODP tonnes. The observed trends can differ significantly depending on the unit used. Controlled substances with a relatively high ODP (e.g. CFCs and CTC) exhibit a different trend from those with a relatively low ODP (e.g. HCFCs).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsumption of controlled substances\r\n\r\nConsumption is an aggregated parameter calculated for data reported under the Montreal Protocol (see Box 1 below). It integrates the statistics on imports, exports, production and destruction of controlled substances into one single metric, excluding non-virgin imports and exports. Amounts that are produced and imported for feedstock use within the EU and process agent use are not included in consumption figures, in line with calculations applied under the Montreal Protocol. New substances listed in Annex II to the Ozone Regulation are also excluded from consumption data.\r\nBox 1. Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nIn brief, consumption (which only applies to controlled substances) is calculated as follows:\r\nCONSUMPTION = ADJUSTED PRODUCTION + ADJUSTED IMPORT - EXPORT - DESTRUCTION\r\n\r\nwith \u2022 ADJUSTED PRODUCTION = total production - production for feedstock in the EU - production for process agent use \u2022 ADJUSTED IMPORT = total virgin imports - virgin imports for feedstock use in the EU - virgin imports for process agent use \u2022 EXPORT = total virgin exports \u2022 DESTRUCTION = total virgin and non-virgin destruction\r\nIn 2020, the consumption of controlled substances amounted to -2,023 metric tonnes, down from -387 metric tonnes in 2019. The single activities that contribute to ODS consumption are shown in the figure below. If the sum of production and imports exceeds the sum of exports and destruction, the consumption is positive, and vice versa. The consumption of controlled substances, when expressed in metric tonnes, has been negative every year since 2012. In recent years, the consumption of controlled substances has largely been driven by CTC, HCFCs and CFC consumption. Expressed in ODP tonnes, consumption in 2020 amounted to -2,043 ODP tonnes, down from 61 ODP tonnes in 2019.\r\nFigure: Trend in consumption of controlled substances by activity\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data. Data reported by companies from the United Kingdom are included in all analyses contained herein, unless otherwise indicated.Sources: Data reported by companies to the European Environment Agency (EEA) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (EU Ozone Regulation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImports of controlled substances\r\n\r\nIn 2020, imports of\u00a0controlled\u00a0virgin substances into the EU amounted to 4,951 metric tonnes, which represents a 6% increase compared with 2019. The imported controlled substances were almost entirely virgin substances and 81% of them were imported from China. Almost 60% of the imported virgin quantities were HCFCs, followed by CFCs. Controlled virgin substances were almost exclusively imported for feedstock use. Imports of controlled non-virgin substances amounted to about 2% of total imports. Expressed in ODP tonnes, imports of virgin halons and CFCs were largest.\r\nFigure: Trend in imports of controlled virgin substances into the EU\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data. Data reported by companies from the United Kingdom are included in all analyses contained herein, unless otherwise indicated.Sources: Data reported by companies to the European Environment Agency (EEA) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (EU Ozone Regulation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExports of controlled substances\r\n\r\nIn 2020, exports of controlled virgin substances from the EU amounted to 20,213 metric tonnes, an increase of 8% compared with 2019. CTC accounted for the largest quantities of exported virgin substances, followed by HCFCs. CTC was mainly exported for feedstock use outside the EU (76% of total exports) and HCFCs mostly for feedstock use and refrigeration. Since almost no CTC was imported in 2020, the exported quantities were mainly produced in the EU or taken from stocks accumulated in previous years. As with imports, controlled non-virgin substances were exported out of the EU to a much lesser extent than controlled virgin substances, amounting to less than 1% of total exports when expressed in metric tonnes. Expressed in ODP tonnes, exports of virgin CTC were largest.\r\nFigure: Trend in exports of controlled virgin substances out of the EU\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data.

This included mostly HCFCs for feedstock, CTC and TCA. Only minor quantities of BCM, halons, CFCs and HBFCs, and no MB, were produced. Expressed in ODP tonnes, production of CTC and HCFCs was largest (78% and 10% of total production, respectively). Controlled substances were produced largely for feedstock use inside the EU (85% of the produced quantity in metric tonnes). Production for feedstock use inside the EU decreased by 8% and production for process agent use also showed a decrease in 2020 compared with 2019. Production for other uses, as accounted for in the estimation of the consumption of controlled substances (see Box 1 above and the section on consumption), decreased by 7% in 2020 compared with 2019. This was mainly because the unintentional by-production of CTC (intended for subsequent destruction) decreased.\r\nFigure: Trend in the production of controlled substances within the EU\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data.

This was the largest decrease observed since 2012 and the lowest recorded value since 2013. The largest quantities destroyed were of CTC, CFCs and HCFCs (73%, 11% and 9% of total destruction, respectively). Expressed in ODP, of the 6,083 ODP tonnes, the largest quantities destroyed were of CTC, CFCs and halons (79%, 10% and 10% of total destruction, respectively).\r\nFigure: Trend in destruction of controlled substances within the EU\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data. Data reported by companies from the United Kingdom are included in all analyses contained herein, unless otherwise indicated.Sources: Data reported by companies to the European Environment Agency (EEA) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (EU Ozone Regulation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedstock use of controlled substances\r\n\r\nA number of ODS serve as feedstock for the manufacture of other products such as refrigerants, foam blowing agents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. In 2020, feedstock use amounted to 148,787 metric tonnes, a 6% decrease compared with 2019. Feedstock availability was 144,099 metric tonnes in 2020, down by 8% from 2019. In total, feedstock use was about 3% higher than feedstock availability.\r\nFigure: Trend in the feedstock availability and use of controlled substances\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data. Data reported by companies from the United Kingdom are included in all analyses contained herein, unless otherwise indicated.Sources: Data reported by companies to the European Environment Agency (EEA) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (EU Ozone Regulation).\r\nIn 2020, the emission rate[1]\u00a0from feedstock uses was 0.04%. The 2020 average emission rate was comparable to the emission rate in 2019 and much lower than the emission rate for earlier years. This appears to point towards improvements in emission control by industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess agent use of controlled substances\r\n\r\nA process agent is a substance that either facilitates or inhibits a chemical reaction in an industrial process. In 2020, make-up[2]\u00a0and emissions stayed well below restrictions imposed by both the Montreal Protocol and the Ozone Regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew substances\r\n\r\nThe Ozone Regulation is more stringent than the rules of the Montreal Protocol and encompasses new substances (halon 1202, n-PB, EB, TFIM and MC). In 2020, the production of new substances amounted to 1,005,677 metric tonnes, less than a 1% increase compared with 2019. The production of new substances was almost exclusively for feedstock use and comprised MC (more than 99% of total production) and n-PB. Expressed in ODP tonnes, the production of MC was also largest (about 98% of total production).\r\nFigure: Trend in the production of new substances within the EU\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data. Data reported by companies from the United Kingdom are included in all analyses contained herein, unless otherwise indicated.Sources: Data reported by companies to the European Environment Agency (EEA) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (EU Ozone Regulation).\r\nIn 2020, the production of new substances was about six times higher than the production of controlled substances expressed in metric tonnes. However, when expressed in ODP tonnes, the production of new substances was almost three times lower than that of controlled substances in the same year. This is because new substances, on average, have a significantly lower ODP than controlled substances.\r\nFigure: Comparison of the production of new and controlled substances within the EU\r\n\r\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the production of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data.

This reduces the concentration levels of ozone in that region of the atmosphere (commonly known as the ozone layer) and thus the capacity of the atmosphere to filter ultraviolet light. Most known ODS are regulated under the Montreal Protocol.\r\nControlled substances\r\nControlled substances are ODS that are listed in Annex\u00a0I of the Ozone Regulation and are subject to the reporting obligation of Article\u00a07 of the Montreal Protocol.\r\nMixtures\r\nThe term \u2018mixtures\u2019 refers to gas mixtures consisting of multiple substances, at least one of which is a controlled substance. Destruction facilities are required to report the quantities of individual substances destroyed each year. In certain cases, however, companies were only able to report on the destruction of mixtures of controlled substances with an unknown composition. Therefore, these mixtures are not included in the data presented in this online data viewer and are not reported under the Montreal Protocol.\r\nNew substances\r\nThe term \u2018new substances\u2019 refers to the five additional substances covered by the EU Ozone Regulation that are not included within the scope of the Montreal Protocol: halon 1202, n-propyl bromide (n-PB), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and methyl chloride (MC). Companies in the EU are obliged to report on the import, export and production of these substances in line with the Ozone Regulation\u2019s higher level of ambition than that of the Montreal Protocol. New substances should not be confused with virgin substances (see below).\r\nVirgin substances\r\nThese are substances that have been produced and have not been previously used. Newly produced substances are, by definition, virgin.\r\nNon-virgin substances\r\nThese are substances that have been previously used and subsequently recovered from products and equipment, and/or been recycled or reclaimed.\r\nUnintentional by-production\r\nUnintentional by-production of controlled substances usually involves volumes that are taken out of the process cycle and are, at least temporarily, stored (e.g. in a buffer tank) before being destroyed, used, placed on the market, exported or sent for destruction in a facility outside the production site.\r\nFeedstock\r\nA number of ODS serve as chemical building blocks for the manufacture of other chemicals (i.e. as \u2018feedstock\u2019). They are used (directly or indirectly) for the manufacture of a diverse range of products including refrigerants, foam blowing agents, solvents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.\r\nProcess agent\r\nA process agent is a substance that either facilitates a chemical reaction or inhibits an intended chemical reaction in an industrial process.\r\nMake-up\r\nMake-up is the quantity of virgin, recovered or reclaimed controlled substances that has not been used in the process cycle before, and that is fed into the process cycle for the first time. For feedstock and process agent uses of controlled substances, make-up has to be reported, including the emissions generated during their use.\r\nOzone-depleting potential\r\nThe ozone-depleting potential (ODP) of a substance refers to the relative amount of ozone depletion caused by it. It is the ratio of the impact on ozone of the emission of a chemical substance to the impact of a similar emission by mass of CFC-11. The quantity in metric tonnes of a particular controlled substance is multiplied by its ODP to give its overall potential to deplete the ozone layer. The ODPs of controlled and new substances are listed in Annexes\u00a0I and II of the Ozone Regulation. Some new substances have a range, rather than a single ODP value. In this online data viewer, the highest value of the ODP value range is used.", "1 \n \n\n \n\nOzone-depleting substances 2021 \n\nThis data viewer accompanies the EEA indicator \u2018Consumption of ozone-depleting substances\u2019 \nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/production-and-consumption-of-ozone-4/assessment-1  \n\n \n\n \n\nMan-made ozone-depleting substances destroy the protective ozone layer and, in 1987, the \n\ninternational community established the Montreal Protocol to cut their consumption and \n\nproduction.

The imported controlled substances were \n\nalmost entirely virgin substances and 81% of them were imported from China. Almost 60% of the \n\nimported virgin quantities were HCFCs, followed by CFCs. Controlled virgin substances were \n\nalmost exclusively imported for feedstock use. Imports of controlled non-virgin substances \n\namounted to about 2% of total imports.

CTC accounted for the largest quantities of exported virgin \n\nsubstances, followed by HCFCs. CTC was mainly exported for feedstock use outside the EU (76% of \n\ntotal exports) and HCFCs mostly for feedstock use and refrigeration. Since almost no CTC was \n\nimported in 2020, the exported quantities were mainly produced in the EU or taken from stocks \n\naccumulated in previous years. As with imports, controlled non-virgin substances were exported \n\nout of the EU to a much lesser extent than controlled virgin substances, amounting to less than 1% \n\nof total exports when expressed in metric tonnes.

This included mostly HCFCs for feedstock, CTC and TCA. Only \n\nminor quantities of BCM, halons, CFCs and HBFCs, and no MB, were produced. Expressed in ODP \n\ntonnes, production of CTC and HCFCs was largest (78% and 10% of total production, respectively). \n\nControlled substances were produced largely for feedstock use inside the EU (85% of the \n\nproduced quantity in metric tonnes). Production for feedstock use inside the EU decreased by 8% \n\nand production for process agent use also showed a decrease in 2020 compared with 2019. \n\nProduction for other uses, as accounted for in the estimation of the consumption of controlled \n\nsubstances (see Box 1 above and the section on consumption), decreased by 7% in 2020 \n\ncompared with 2019. This was mainly because the unintentional by-production of CTC (intended \n\nfor subsequent destruction) decreased. \n\f\n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nNotes: The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 January 2020 did not affect the \n\nproduction of this briefing, which refers to 2020 data.

This \n\nreduces the concentration levels of ozone in that region of the atmosphere (commonly known as \n\nthe ozone layer) and thus the capacity of the atmosphere to filter ultraviolet light. Most known \n\nODS are regulated under the Montreal Protocol. \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/ozone-depleting-substances-and-climate-change/ozone-depleting-substances-2021/#feedstock-use-of-controlled-substances\f\n \n\n11 \n \n\nControlled substances \n\nControlled substances are ODS that are listed in Annex I of the Ozone Regulation and are subject \n\nto the reporting obligation of Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol. \n\nMixtures \n\nThe term \u2018mixtures\u2019 refers to gas mixtures consisting of multiple substances, at least one of which \n\nis a controlled substance. Destruction facilities are required to report the quantities of individual \n\nsubstances destroyed each year. In certain cases, however, companies were only able to report on \n\nthe destruction of mixtures of controlled substances with an unknown composition. Therefore, \n\nthese mixtures are not included in the data presented in this online data viewer and are not \n\nreported under the Montreal Protocol. \n\nNew substances \n\nThe term \u2018new substances\u2019 refers to the five additional substances covered by the EU Ozone \n\nRegulation that are not included within the scope of the Montreal Protocol: halon 1202, n-propyl \n\nbromide (n-PB), ethyl bromide (EB), trifluoroiodomethane (TFIM) and methyl chloride (MC). \n\nCompanies in the EU are obliged to report on the import, export and production of these \n\nsubstances in line with the Ozone Regulation\u2019s higher level of ambition than that of the Montreal \n\nProtocol. New substances should not be confused with virgin substances (see below). \n\nVirgin substances \n\nThese are substances that have been produced and have not been previously used. Newly \n\nproduced substances are, by definition, virgin. \n\nNon-virgin substances \n\nThese are substances that have been previously used and subsequently recovered from products \n\nand equipment, and/or been recycled or reclaimed. \n\nUnintentional by-production \n\nUnintentional by-production of controlled substances usually involves volumes that are taken out \n\nof the process cycle and are, at least temporarily, stored (e.g. in a buffer tank) before being \n\ndestroyed, used, placed on the market, exported or sent for destruction in a facility outside the \n\nproduction site. \n\nFeedstock \n\nA number of ODS serve as chemical building blocks for the manufacture of other chemicals (i.e. \n\nas \u2018feedstock\u2019). They are used (directly or indirectly) for the manufacture of a diverse range of \n\nproducts including refrigerants, foam blowing agents, solvents, polymers, pharmaceuticals and \n\nagricultural chemicals. \n\nProcess agent \n\f\n \n\n12 \n \n\nA process agent is a substance that either facilitates a chemical reaction or inhibits an intended \n\nchemical reaction in an industrial process. \n\nMake-up \n\nMake-up is the quantity of virgin, recovered or reclaimed controlled substances that has not been \n\nused in the process cycle before, and that is fed into the process cycle for the first time. For \n\nfeedstock and process agent uses of controlled substances, make-up has to be reported, including \n\nthe emissions generated during their use. \n\nOzone-depleting potential \n\nThe ozone-depleting potential (ODP) of a substance refers to the relative amount of ozone \n\ndepletion caused by it. It is the ratio of the impact on ozone of the emission of a chemical \n\nsubstance to the impact of a similar emission by mass of CFC-11. The quantity in metric tonnes of \n\na particular controlled substance is multiplied by its ODP to give its overall potential to deplete the \n\nozone layer. The ODPs of controlled and new substances are listed in Annexes I and II of the \n\nOzone Regulation. Some new substances have a range, rather than a single ODP value. In this \n\nonline data viewer, the highest value of the ODP value range is used.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The protocol covers around 100 individual substances with a high ozone-depleting potential (ODP), including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as \u2018controlled substances\u2019. Within the EU, the use of and trade in substances is regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (known as the Ozone Regulation).

In 2020, the consumption of controlled substances remained negative and amounted to -2,023 metric tonnes, down from -387 metric tonnes in 2019. The consumption of controlled substances, when expressed in metric tonnes, was largely driven by consumption of CTC, HCFCs and CFCs.

It will be important to ensure that the illegal trade in ODS is addressed, as this could delay ozone layer recovery significantly.\nIt will also be important to ensure that international and European legislation is strengthened, for instance by including ODS not covered at present. Evidence suggests that chemicals not covered play a role in depleting the ozone layer, for instance very short-lived substances, such as dichloromethane. Levels of such substances have increased, uncontrolled, by around 60 % in the past decade, which could delay ozone recovery by 30 years.\nGlobally, consumption of ODS controlled under the Montreal Protocol declined by 98% worldwide in the period 1986-2019.\nHowever, much remains to be done to ensure that damage to the ozone layer is reverted. Initiatives to further reduce releases of ODS could involve the following:\n- Addressing the strong growth in the production and consumption of HCFCs in developing countries;\n- Collecting and safely disposing of the large quantities of ODS contained in old equipment and buildings (the so-called ODS 'banks');\n- Ensuring that restrictions on ODS continue to be properly implemented and the remaining worldwide use of ODS declines further;\n- Preventing illegal trade in ODS; and\n- Strengthening the international and European framework on ODS (e.g. inclusion of other known ODS, restricting exemptions)\nIn the EU-27, ODS are still used, to the extent allowed by the Montreal Protocol and the EU ODS Regulation, by means of exemptions to the overall phase out.
