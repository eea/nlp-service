These trends have been driven mainly by economic growth; however, the amount of waste generated increased by a smaller extent than the economy, indicating the relative decoupling of waste generation from economic growth.\nPublished:\u2012 25min read\nWaste generation is increasing in the EU. Reducing this, and achieving the absolute decoupling of waste generation from economic growth, is a primary objective of EU waste and circular economy policies. The EU Waste Framework Directivesets out a waste hierarchy, the guiding principle of EU and national waste policies.\nFrom 2010 to 2018, total waste generation increased by 5.0% (114 million tonnes) in the 27 EU Member States (EU-27). Major mineral wastes, such as hard rocks, concrete, soils and others (that are mainly produced in the mining and construction sectors) feature in big quantities in relation to other waste types. This alters the interpretation of trends. They also usually represent an environmental issue of relatively less concern. If we exclude them from the totals, the remaining waste streams, more environmentally significant, increased even more, by 7.0% (50.3 million tonnes).\nThe main driver of increasing waste generation is economic growth, with gross domestic product (GDP), the most commonly used indicator of economic growth, increasing by 23% between 2010 and 2018. Population size was relatively stable and thus does not explain the trend. However, while the amount of waste generated grew considerably, it did so at a significantly slower pace than the economy, indicating the relative decoupling of waste generation from economic growth.\nChanges in waste management also contributed to the trend, as nearly half of the increase can be accounted for by secondary wastes, i.e. from operations such as sorting residues. This suggests that waste management is improving in the EU but that changes in management practices that generate secondary wastes also need to be managed.\nUnfortunately, the trends observed suggest that the EU is not on track to meet its goal of reducing waste generation. The trends also indicate that the EU, as a whole, is not yet fully implementing the first step of the waste hierarchy \u2014 waste prevention \u2014 as laid down in the Waste Framework Directive.

For this reason, waste generation related to demographics (e.g. population) or economic activity (e.g. GDP) and total waste generation are considered the best indicators for quantifying waste prevention.\nOn average, 1.8 tonnes of total waste (excluding major mineral wastes) were generated per European citizen, up from 1.7 tonnes/capita in 2010. This average masks large country differences, both in absolute waste volumes per capita and in the waste generation trend.\nAmounts generated ranged from less than 1 tonne per capita to 9.7 tonnes per capita in 2018. The large quantity of waste generated in Estonia is related to energy production based on oil shale (Eurostat, 2019a), while waste data for North Macedonia show a high degree of fluctuation over time.

Given the high priority of food waste prevention \nat the global level and the requirements of Directive (EU) \n2018/851 of 30 May 2018 amending Waste Framework \nDirective 2008/98/EC (WFD), a separate sub-programme for the \nprevention of food waste was prepared, following the steps for \ndevelopment and the philosophy of the current waste prevention \nprogramme \nThe NWMP and NWPP have been developed in accordance \nwith Art. 28 and Art. 29 of the WFD and Art. 49 and Art. 50 of \nthe Waste Management Act of the Republic of Bulgaria. In \naddition to the legal requirements, a number of European and \nnational programming and methodological documents have been \ntaken into account in their development, such as the \nmethodological guidance note of the European Commission \nDirectorate-General for Environment: \u2018Preparation of a waste \nmanagement plan\u2019 \n\nhttps://www.moew.government.bg/bg/proekt-na-nacionalen-plan-za-upravlenie-na-otpaducite-2021-2028/\f\n Budget envisaged for \nimplementation of the project \n\nImplementation of the NWPP: BGN 239.48 million (approx. \nEUR 122.15 million) \nImplementation of the sub-programme for the prevention of \nfood waste: BGN 75.45 million (approx. EUR 38.49 million) \n\n \nWaste generation \n \nThe following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and the decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth in Bulgaria. \n \nMunicipal solid waste \n\n\u2022 Figure 1 shows the generation of municipal waste per capita and indicates a significant \ndecrease from 599 kg per capita (in both 2004 and 2008) to 404 kg in 2016. The level \nremained low (407 kg per capita) in 2018 and 2019. \n\n\u2022 A decreasing trend was most obvious between the years 2009 and 2013, and the level has \nremained low, reaching a minimum in 2016. \n\n\u2022 Bulgarian municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has remained under the European average \n(489 kg per capita/year) since 2012. This may have been positively influenced by the \nimplementation of the measures introduced by the first Bulgarian NWPP, which started in \n2014. \n\n\u2022 In line with the positive progress in the generation of municipal waste per capita, the total \namount of municipal waste generated also follows a downwards trend and, between 2008 and \n2018, a decrease of about 36 % was observed. \n\n \nFigure 1: Municipal waste generation in Bulgaria (kg per capita), 2004-2019 \n \n\n \nSource: Eurostat Circular Economy Monitoring Framework. \n \nTotal waste \n\n\u2022 The NWPP reports that in the period 2008-2018 there was an unfavourable upwards trend in \nthe amount of industrial waste generated (35 %, despite fluctuations in some years during this \nperiod). This was the result of several large economic activities, mostly connected to building \nthe infrastructure for energy, fuel, water supply, sewerage and waste management services. It \nhas an obvious effect on Bulgaria\u2019s total waste generation excluding major mineral wastes \n(see Figure 2). This trend seems to be in line with the GDP of Bulgaria, which is constantly \nincreasing. \n\n\u2022 In the selected period, the aim of breaking the link between economic growth and the \ngeneration of waste was not achieved. \n\n\u2022 The generation of waste is clearly decoupled from population growth in Bulgaria, as the \npopulation is following a decreasing trend. \n\n \n\f\nFigure 2: Growth rate of waste (excluding major mineral wastes), GDP and population in Bulgaria, \n2010-2018 (2010 = 100) \n \n\n \nSource: Eurostat.  \n\f\nWaste prevention programme \n \nObjectives and priorities \n \n\n1.

The aim is for \nall municipalities in the country to have waste management \nprogrammes that include waste prevention goals and measures \n\n \n \n  \n\f\nFood waste prevention \n \nFood waste generation \nIn Bulgaria, precise data on the generation of food waste by sectors measured according to the EU \nmethodology for food waste adopted in 2019 are not yet available. However, based on data from the \nExecutive Environment Agency and in view of Regulation No 2/2014 on waste classification, \nestimates show that, in 2018, the total amount of food waste in Bulgaria reached almost 500 000 \ntonnes, of which the main source was households (almost 58 %), followed by the food processing and \nproduction sector (38 %) and primary production (3 %). \n \nMeasures to prevent food waste \nThe Bulgarian Food Bank was established in 2012. It is currently the leading national organisation in \nthe country specialising in the collection, storage and distribution of donated food products with a \nshort shelf life, in accordance with all food safety standards. With the help of a network of partner \norganisations and volunteers across the country, food is distributed to thousands of people in need. \n \nIn line with global goals and EU food waste policies, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry \nhas begun developing a comprehensive national programme to prevent and reduce food loss, which \nwill include measures targeting food loss and generation of waste from the farm to the table. \n \nThe action plan of the sub-programme for food waste prevention sets a strategic goal and operational \ngoals consistent with the objectives of the NWPP 2021-2028 and envisages implementing various \nmeasures and activities to prevent food waste to a total value of around BGN 75.5 million \n(approximately EUR 38.5 million). \n \nThe measures are mostly information-educational and administrative-regulatory in nature and are \naimed at several target groups, including public institutions, households and business. Their \nimplementation will contribute to: \n\n\u2022 improving the quality of information and tracking of the quantities of food waste generated, \nreused, recycled and recovered; \n\n\u2022 raising public awareness of the issue of food loss through food waste; \n\u2022 raising awareness of preventing food waste in various target groups (municipalities, NGOs, \n\nbusinesses, households, etc.); \n\u2022 encouraging food donation. \n\n \nFor a more comprehensive mapping of country efforts to prevent food waste, please visit the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s Food Loss and Waste Prevention Hub. \n \nReuse of products \n \nData \nWith regard to the Commission Implementing Decision (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2021.010.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2021%3A01\n0%3ATOC), this section will be updated by the EEA accordingly. \n \nMeasures to support reuse \nActivities and measures targeting reuse are mostly covered by other components of the Bulgarian \nNWMP 2021-2028 (e.g. the programme for achieving the objectives of preparation for reuse and \nrecycling of municipal waste). \n \nIn the action plan of NWPP 2021-2028 (as part of the NWMP), a significant measure to support reuse \nenvisages an amendment to the Local Tax Act introducing a patent tax at the minimum permissible \nrate for those taxable individuals whose activity directly leads to the reuse of certain products (e.g. \nrepair of shoes, furniture, clothes, household appliances). The indicator for this measure is set as the \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu-food-loss-waste-prevention-hub/eu-member-states\f\nnumber of municipalities whose municipal councils voted for a minimum patent tax rate for services \nrelated to the reuse of products and hence to the implementation of waste prevention policies. \n \nA rich variety of used goods and vintage items can be given another life at one of the flea markets in \nthe streets of Bulgarian cities, mostly held as informal gatherings of vendors who want to sell things \nthey no longer use. The largest flea market, known as Bitaka, takes place every weekend in Sofia. \n \nTo support the reuse of products, a number of second-hand online shops operate on Bulgarian \nwebsites, while one of the reuse initiatives sometimes hosts pop-up events in Sofia. Some of the \nonline shops focus on selling clothes, shoes and accessories (e.g. modeteka.bg, remix.bg, mania.bg) or \neven offer textiles for rent, while others offer a wide variety of used furniture and other goods (e.g. \nbazar.bg, olx.bg).  \n\nhttp://modeteka.bg/\f\nBest practice examples \n \nTextile reuse in Bulgaria \nThe Association of Recyclers and Traders of Second Hand Clothes was founded to sustain the \nindustry \u2014 which has social and economic importance for the development of the circular economy \n\u2014 and to control compliance with EU and national legislation concerning textile processing and trade \nin textiles. It unites over 40 companies in Bulgaria that specialise in the collection, sorting and sale of \nreusable textiles. Separately collected textile waste is sent to sorting centres where it undergoes a \nnumber of processes before it is converted into second-hand clothes and shoes of various quality. \nSome of these items are marketed in Bulgaria but most are exported to other countries. \n \nFree compost campaign \nThe capital of Bulgaria has facilities for processing green waste and other biowaste, such as the \u2018Han \nBogrov\u2019 facility for biological treatment, producing compost and electricity. Since 2014, all biowaste, \nincluding food from restaurants, kindergartens, markets, retail chains and green waste, such as \nbranches, leaves or grass, are collected separately and processed. This led to an initiative introduced at \nthe beginning of 2015, in which the municipality provides up to 10 kg of compost free of charge to all \nSofia residents who have paid a municipal waste tax. Some of the compost produced is also used in \nthe gardens and parks of Sofia. \n \nSofia municipality campaign \u2014 \u2018Compost at home\u2019 \nIn 2010, the municipality of Sofia launched a home composting programme named \u2018Compost at \nhome\u2019, which aims to encourage citizens to reduce their production of household food and green \nwaste, as well as encouraging them to  recycle these types of waste. Over the years, many thousands \nof 700-litre composters, activators, aerators and information materials have been provided to \nhouseholds, schools, kindergartens and parks that wanted to become partners of the municipality in all \nof its 24 metropolitan areas. \n \nOne of the waste prevention measures included in the NWPP 2021-2028 builds on these achievements \nand sets Bulgarian municipalities the target of providing 100 000 composters to households by 2028. \n \n  \n\nhttp://artshc.org/en/\f\nLinks to the circular economy \n \nWaste prevention is an integral part of the comprehensive transformation towards a circular economy. \nIt reduces not only the input of natural resources into the economy but also the efforts required to \ncollect and recycle waste. \n \nApproaches to improving circularity are often linked to successful waste prevention.

The outlook towards 2020 remains, however, uncertain since the examined past time series is short and the increase relates mostly to just one data point (2014-2016).\nFor further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.3 in the EEA Environmental indicator report 2018\nThe Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) states that, by 2020, absolute and per capita waste generation should be in decline. A society that meets its needs while producing less waste is more resource efficient, with lower environmental risks from waste management. The total amount of waste generated, excluding major mineral wastes, is used as the indicator to track progress towards a reduction in waste generation. The amount of this waste in the EU increased by 5.1 % in absolute amounts and by 3.6 % per capita between 2010 and 2016. The key driver behind the increase in waste generation seems to be the increase in the generation of secondary waste, triggered by a move away from landfilling towards recycling and incineration. The prospects of waste generation declining by 2020 are uncertain as the increase in waste generation is associated mainly with only one data point (2014-2016) and because there are methodological uncertainties (short time series \u2014 only four data points \u2014 and some data collection improvements in waste statistics) related to the past trend. There is, however, a risk that waste generation continues to increase in line with economic growth. On the other hand, there is an expectation that the measures in the Circular Economy Package will contribute to a reduction in waste generation in the longer term.\nThe 7th EAP includes an objective that, by 2020, absolute waste and per capita waste generation are in decline and waste is managed safely as a resource (EU, 2013). The waste hierarchy is the central framework for EU and national waste policies. This hierarchy gives the highest priority to waste prevention, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery and finally disposal. Reducing the amount of waste generated means that there is less waste to manage and also, potentially, that the demand for material and energy resources and associated environmental impacts has been reduced (AIRS_PO2.1, 2018). This briefing examines the trends in waste generation by using the total amount of waste generated, excluding major mineral wastes, as an indicator. For terminology and rationale of choice, see the \u2018About the indicator\u2019 section at the end of the briefing.\nThe Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe contains several waste-related milestones to be met by 2020, including one that requires waste generated per capita to be in absolute decline (EC, 2011).\nWaste prevention and the use of waste as a resource is becoming increasingly important, not only in environmental policy but also in industrial and raw materials policy. In December 2015, the European Commission published \u2018Closing the loop \u2014 An EU action plan for the circular economy\u2019 (EC, 2015), otherwise known as the Circular Economy Package. Unlike the traditional linear take\u2013make\u2013consume\u2013dispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respect planetary boundaries by increasing the proportion of renewable or recyclable resources while reducing the consumption of raw materials. Approaches such as eco-design and sharing, reuse, repair and refurbishing will play a significant role in maintaining the utility of products and components, and reducing the generation of waste (EEA, 2016, 2017, 2018).\nThe Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008) obliges EU Member States to adopt and implement waste prevention programmes. The revised Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2018) strengthens this requirement but does not introduce binding quantified targets for waste prevention. A review of available programmes indicates that countries use a broad range of measures with a focus on information-based instruments and, to a lesser extent, regulatory and economic instruments. A total of 17 out of 27 waste prevention programmes analysed include quantitative targets (EEA, 2015).\nNote: The data were extracted on 12 October 2018. The 2016 data are Eurostat estimates.\nThe total amount of waste generated in the EU, excluding major mineral wastes, increased by 5.1 % between 2010 and 2016 (Figure 1)[1]. The total amount of waste, excluding major mineral wastes, increased by 6.9 % over the same period when Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey \u2014 the four other EEA member countries for which data are available \u2014 were added to the EU total (EEA calculations based on Eurostat, 2018a).\nIn 2016, the highest absolute levels of waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) in the EU were recorded for the water and waste sector, for households, and for the manufacturing sector.\nBetween 2010 and 2016, there were some shifts in waste generation between sectors in the EU. Most prominently, waste generated in the water and waste sector increased by 38 %, while in the energy and extraction sector it increased by 2 %. Over the same period, waste generation decreased by 6 % in the services, manufacturing and construction sectors and by 3 % in the agriculture, forestry and fishing, and households sectors.\nThe waste includes secondary waste, which is mainly generated in the \u2018water and waste sector\u2019. The increase in secondary waste seems to be the main factor in the increasing overall trend in waste generation in the 2010-2016 period. This waste is generated during the treatment of waste and comprises, for example, sorting residues, sludges and incineration ashes. More complex waste management such as recycling and incineration usually results in more secondary waste. The EU is moving away from landfilling of waste towards more recycling and incineration. For example, the share of landfilled waste (excluding major mineral wastes) decreased from 28 % to 24 % in the 2010-2016 period (EEA calculation based on Eurostat, 2018b). This development led to an increase in the amount of secondary waste generated, which increased from a share of 12 % of total waste in 2010 to 18 % in 2016, excluding major mineral wastes.\nThe overall improvements and the shifts between sectors are probably due to a combination of factors including efficiency improvements in production processes and management, and changes in the structure of the economy. The overall improvements and the shift between sectors may also be because of methodological changes in data collection and should therefore be interpreted with caution.\nIn conclusion, the overall amount of waste generated increased between 2010 and 2016. However, only four data points were used to assess the past trend \u2014 earlier data were available but were strongly influenced by adjustments in data collection methods and were therefore not used in this indicator. Methodological adjustments may have also influenced the four data points to some degree. Furthermore, the increase in waste generation is primarily associated with only one data point (2014-2016). As a result of these uncertainties, the outlook towards reducing waste generation within the period of the implementation of the 7th EAP (2014-2020) is also uncertain. There is nevertheless a risk that waste generation increases along with economic growth. On the other hand, measures in the Circular Economy Package and the waste prevention programmes in the EU Member States should contribute to a reduction in waste generation.\nIn 2016, the EU per capita generation of waste \u2014 excluding major mineral wastes \u2014 amounted to 1 783 kg. This is 63 kg more than in 2010; an increase of 3.7 % over the 2010-2016 period. When Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey (the four other EEA member countries for which data are available) are included in EU per capita waste generation, the trend over the 2010-2016 period remains similar, with an increase of 4.4 % (EEA calculations based on Eurostat, 2018a).\nFigure 2 shows that the majority of European countries generate between 1 and 2 tonnes of waste (excluding major mineral waste) per person per year. Between 2010 and 2016, half of the EU countries reduced their per capita waste generation, while the other half increased it. The high figures for Estonia are because of energy production based on oil shale (Eurostat, 2018c).\nNote: The data were extracted on 17 October 2018. For 2016, data for Albania, Greece and Ireland were not available and data for 2014 were used instead. Eurostat data estimates for 2016 were used for the EU-28\nThe long-term prospects for reducing the waste generated in the EU are uncertain. A shift to a circular economy, with increased reuse of goods and materials, has the potential to reduce waste generation. The waste prevention programmes adopted by the EU Member States, Iceland and Norway can be expected to take effect towards 2020. However, the effectiveness of many of the waste prevention measures in the programmes can currently not be assessed for the EU and Europe as a whole. The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015) includes a number of measures that aim to reduce waste generation beyond 2020. These include concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis \u2014 turning one industry\u2019s by-product into another industry\u2019s raw material \u2014 and economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electric and electronic equipment, and vehicles). The success of these measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for reducing waste generation.\nThis indicator is defined as the weight of waste generated per year, excluding major mineral wastes (mineral construction and demolition waste, other mineral waste, dredging spoils and soils). Although the indicator focuses mainly on non-mineral wastes, which represent approximately 35 % of the total waste generated in the EU, \u2018it is considered to reflect the general trend in waste generation more accurately and in a more comparable way than the generated total including mineral wastes\u2019 (Eurostat, 2018d). This exclusion enhances the quality of the indicator as the uncertainty over major mineral waste data and associated statistics (in particular construction and mining) is rather high, while for some waste streams (for example contaminated soils) the key aim is to remediate these waste streams rather than to count them as waste. The exclusion also enhances comparability across countries, as mineral waste accounts for very high quantities in some countries and for some economic activities, such as mining and construction.\nWaste generation data by economic sector are published by Eurostat every 2 years. These are grouped for the purpose of the indicator in the following way: agriculture; forestry and fishing; energy and extraction; water and waste; manufacturing; construction; services; and households.\nThe water and waste sector includes water collection, treatment and supply, sewerage and three waste sector categories (waste collection, treatment and disposal activities, materials recovery, remediation activities and other waste management services; and wholesale waste and scrap). The data, especially for the water and waste sector, include secondary waste, i.e. material that is the output of waste treatment (secondary waste) (Eurostat, 2018e). Progress in the (pre-) treatment of waste may result in an increase in generated waste in the indicator because waste is counted twice; as primary and as secondary waste.\nThe energy and extraction sector includes electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply plus non-mineral wastes from mining and quarrying. Manufacturing includes food, textiles, wood, paper, coke, chemicals, metals, electronics, transport equipment and other machinery.\nThe data used in this indicator are based on reporting according to the EU Waste Statistics Regulation (EU, 2002). The first reporting year was 2004 and data quality has been improving since then. In particular, during the 2004-2008 period, many countries implemented methodological changes in their data collection, including allocation of waste to sectors, reclassification from unspecific waste codes to more specific ones and exclusion of by-products from waste reporting. In 2010, a major revision of the Waste Statistics Regulation took effect, enabling a more precise calculation of the waste category \u2018waste excluding major mineral wastes\u2019 and the separate identification of secondary wastes. For all these reasons, the indicator in this briefing uses 2010 as a base year. It should be kept in mind that an analysis of trends that is based on four data points only (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016) is, nevertheless, rather uncertain.\n[1] According to the methodology used across this series of briefings (that supports the monitoring of the 7th EAP), a change of less than 3 % in the indicator value from the base year to the year with the latest available data is considered insignificant and the trend is assessed as being relatively stable. A change of more than 3 % represents a significant trend (improving or deteriorating depending on the case). Last year\u2019s trend was assessed as being stable, since there was an increase of less than 3 %, while this year\u2019s trend was judged as being deteriorating since the increase was 5.1 %, i.e. more than 3 %.\nEC, 2011, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2018Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe\u2019 (COM(2011) 571 final).\nEC, 2014, Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on statistics compiled pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 on waste statistics and their quality (COM(2014) 079 final).\nEC, 2015, Closing the loop \u2014 An EU action plan for the circular economy (COM(2015) 614 final) (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/index_en.htm) accessed 9 October 2018.\nEEA, 2015, Waste prevention in Europe \u2014 the status in 2014, EEA Report No 6/2015, European Environment Agency.\nEEA, 2016, Circular economy in Europe \u2014 Developing the knowledge base, EEA Report No 2/2016, European Environment Agency.\nEEA, 2017, Circular by design \u2014 Products in the circular economy, EEA Report No 6/2017, European Environment Agency.\nEEA, 2018, Waste prevention in Europe \u2013 policies, status and trends in reuse in 2017, EEA Report No. 4/2018, European Environment Agency.\nEU, 2002, Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics (OJ L 332, 9.12.2002, p. 1).\nEU, 2008, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3\u201330).\nEU, 2013, Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on a General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 \u2018Living well, within the limits of our planet\u2019, Annex A, paragraph 43(d) (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 171\u2013200).\nEU, 2018, Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, 2018/851 (OJ L 150, 14.06.2018, p. 109\u2013140).\nEurostat, 2018a, \u2018Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (env_wasgen)\u2019 (http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wasgen&lang=en) accessed 12 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018b, \u2018Treatment of waste by waste category, hazardousness and waste management operations (env_wastrt)\u2019 (http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wastrt&lang=en) accessed 18 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018c, \u2018Statistics explained \u2013 Waste statistics\u2019 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Waste_statistics) accessed 18 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018d, \u2018Eurostat metadata \u2014 Generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes by hazardousness (sdg_12_50)\u2019 (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/EN/sdg_12_50_esmsip2.htm) accessed 18 October 2018.\nEurostat, 2018e, \u2018Eurostat metadata \u2014 Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (env_wasgen)\u2019 (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/env_wasgt_esms.htm) accessed 18 October 2018.\nAIRS briefings\nAIRS_PO2.1, 2018, Resource efficiency.\nEnvironmental indicator report 2018 \u2013 In support to the monitoring of the 7th Environment Action Programme, EEA report No19/2018, European Environment Agency\n29 Nov 2017 - Waste generation\n09 Dec 2016 - Waste generation\n2010-2020\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2018/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/waste-generation or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 11:12 AM\nFiled under: waste generation waste prevention waste recycling total waste\nFiled under: waste generation, waste prevention, waste, recycling, total waste\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

With a share of 34\u00a0%, \nbio-waste is the largest single component of \nmunicipal waste in the EU. Recycling of bio-waste \nis key for meeting the EU target to recycle 65\u00a0% of \nmunicipal waste by 2035. \n\n\u2022 About 60\u00a0% of bio-waste is food waste. Reducing \nthe demand for food by preventing food waste can \ndecrease the environmental impacts of producing, \nprocessing and transporting food. The benefits \nfrom reducing such upstream impacts are much \nhigher than any environmental benefits from \nrecycling food waste. The Sustainable Development \nGoals'\u00a0target of halving food waste by 2030 has \nhelped to put preventing food waste high on the \npolicy agenda in most European countries.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 88 million tonnes (173\u00a0kg per person) \nof food is wasted every year in the EU-28 (28 EU \nMember States) along the entire food value chain. \nThis corresponds to about 20\u00a0% of all food produced.\n\n\u2022 To enable bio-waste to be used as a source of \nhigh-quality fertiliser and soil improver, it needs \nto be collected separately at source while keeping \nimpurity levels low. Contamination with plastics \nis a growing concern, and plastics need to be \nprevented from entering bio-waste. Although the \n\nshare of municipal waste composted and digested \nwas 17\u00a0% in 2018 \u2014 up from 11\u00a0% in 2004 \u2014 a \nhigh proportion of bio-waste still ends up in the \nmixed waste that is landfilled or incinerated, even \nin many countries with well-established separate \ncollection\u00a0systems.\n\n\u2022 More and more plastic consumer products are \nlabelled as 'compostable' or 'biodegradable', \nand there has been a proliferation of different \nlabels. This creates risks of confusing consumers, \ncontaminating compost and increasing the \ncosts of\u00a0treatment. Clear rules on labelling \nof compostable/biodegradable plastics are \nneeded, and we also need to identify which \napplications might have overall benefits and under \nwhich\u00a0conditions.\n\n\u2022 Quality standards and quality assurance processes \nfor compost, digestate, fertilisers and soil improvers \nhelp to build trust in them and are an integral \npart of a good bio-waste management system. \nA\u00a0Europe-wide requirement to implement quality \nassurance systems covering all compost and \ndigestates would improve trust in and awareness \nof the value of bio-waste. In many countries such \nsystems already exist.\n\n\u2022 Treatment of separately collected bio-waste is \ndominated by composting, but anaerobic digestion, \nwith biogas production, is increasing. Biogas is \na source of renewable energy. Research and \ninnovation increasingly explore the opportunities \nfor using bio-waste, mainly from food processing, \nas a new source of higher value products such \nas volatile fatty acids and biofuels, but many \nchallenges remain.\n\nKey messages\n\f\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities6\n\nExecutive summary\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThis report provides an overview of bio-waste \nprevention, generation, collection and treatment \nin Europe. It aims to support countries by sharing \nexperience and best practice. Bio-waste (Box ES.1) \ncan play an important role in the transition to \na\u00a0circular economy, by both preventing its generation \nand capturing its potential as a source of valuable \nsecondary resources (Figure ES.1). The focus of this \nreport is on food and garden waste from households \nand similar public and commercial activities such as \nfood services.\n\nEuropean circular economy and waste policies \nincreasingly address bio-waste as one of several key \nwaste streams. These include new targets for the \nrecycling and preparing for reuse of municipal waste \nand an obligation for separate collection for biowaste. Moreover, EU Member States are required to \nmonitor food waste generation and to have a food \nwaste prevention programme, supporting Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 12.3 \u2014 to halve food waste by 2030. \nThe 'Farm to fork' strategy on sustainable food within \nthe EU's Green Deal (EC, 2019a) will reinforce food \nwaste prevention.\n\nBio-waste accounts for more than 34\u00a0% of the \nmunicipal solid waste generated, amounting to \n86\u00a0million tonnes in 2017 in the EU-28 (28 EU Member \nStates for the period 2013-2020). Recycling bio-waste \nis therefore crucial for meeting the EU target to recycle \n65\u00a0% of municipal waste by 2035.\n\nThe level of separate bio-waste collection differs \nconsiderably across Europe. Many countries are far \nfrom capturing bio-waste's full potential. Implementing \na separate bio-waste collection system is a sometimes \nlengthy and always complex process. It needs \na\u00a0comprehensive and coordinated policy framework \n\nembedding a bio-waste strategy into broader waste and \ncircular economy strategies. Targets or pay-as-you-throw \nschemes will create clear incentives to divert bio-waste \nfrom residual waste. Awareness-raising activities, \nproviding good information to consumers and matching \ntreatment capacity to the volume of separately collected \nbio-waste are other crucial factors.\n\nFood waste accounts for nearly two thirds (60\u00a0%) \nof\u00a0all bio-waste from households and similar sources. \nMore than other waste types, preventing food \nwaste is perceived as an ethical responsibility for \nsociety. It\u00a0is\u00a0associated with a waste of economic \nresources and\u00a0their resulting negative environmental \nexternalities. Generally, in the majority of European \ncountries, food waste stands out as a priority in waste \nprevention policies. The most common policy actions \nto address food waste are awareness-raising and \ninformation campaigns. Other common measures are \nfood redistribution platforms and increasing promotion \nof retailers' second-class food sales. However, \nmeasuring the effectiveness of waste prevention \nactivities or policies is still a challenge. In the future, \nharmonised data should enable us to compare the \npotential impact of different policy mixes for preventing \nfood waste applied in European countries.\n\nComposting (treatment in the presence of oxygen) \nand anaerobic digestion (treatment in the absence \nof oxygen) are currently the two most widely applied \ntreatment techniques. Composting dominates the \ntreatment capacity but the use of anaerobic digestion \nis increasing. Anaerobic digestion generates biogas and \nis thus a source of renewable energy. The preferred \ntreatment technique depends on the composition \nof the bio-waste and the properties of the separate \ncollection system, but anaerobic digestion tends to \ndeliver higher environmental benefits.\n\n \nBox ES.1 What is bio-waste?\n\nAccording to the Waste Framework Directive's definition, bio-waste comprises 'biodegradable garden and park waste, food \nand kitchen waste from households, offices, restaurants, wholesale, canteens, caterers and retail premises and comparable \nwaste from food-processing plants'. Food waste, a key component of bio-waste, can be edible (e.g. food purchased but not \neaten, leftovers from meals) or non-edible (e.g. banana peel or bones). The edible part is targeted by food waste prevention \nmeasures. Apart from bio-waste, there are other biodegradable wastes, for example paper and cardboard waste, wood waste \nand natural fibres in textiles. However, these are outside the definition of bio-waste and are not addressed in this report.\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n7Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nFigure ES.1  Bio-waste in a circular economy\n\nRE\nDU\n\nCE, REDISTRIBUTE, REPURPO\nSE\n\nSEPARATE \nCOLLECTION\n\nPLANTS, \nFOOD,\nFEED\n\nCONSUMPTION\nAND STOCK\n\nCOMPOSTING\nDIGESTION EM\n\nISSIO\nN\n\nS\n\nEXTRACTION AND IMPORT OF NATURAL\nRESOURCES, INCLUDING ENERGY CARRIERS\n\nINCINERATION LANDFILL\n\nMinimise\n\nHOME COMPOSTING\nCOMMUNITY COMPOSTING\n\nSOIL IMPROVER, \nORGANIC FERTILISER, \n\nBIOGAS\n\nCO\nN\n\nTA\nM\n\nIN\nA\n\nTED\n \n\nBIO\n-W\n\nA\nSTE\n\nM\nIN\n\nER\nA\n\nL \nFE\n\nRT\nIL\n\nIS\nER\n\n, \nPE\n\nST\nIC\n\nID\nE,\n\n F\nU\n\nEL\nS\n\nFO\nO\n\nD\n A\n\nN\nD\n\n F\nEE\n\nD\n\nINPUT\nMATERIALS\n\nCOMPOST\n\nARABLE LAND\n\nPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n8 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nTo close the bio-waste circle, the compost and \ndigestate should be of good quality to enable their \nuse as a soil improver and/or fertiliser. To create \na\u00a0market for compost and digestate, managing the \nquality of the process and the end products is very \nimportant, as it can create trust in the outputs. The \nseparation of bio-waste at source is a basic condition \nfor achieving high-quality outputs. Of the countries \nsurveyed for this report, 24 have or are currently \ndeveloping national standards for compost quality. \nOut of these, 12 countries have developed compost \nquality management and assurance schemes, \ncreating access to higher added value markets such \nas potting compost. Applying compost to European \nsoils \u2014 and especially soils with a low organic matter \ncontent \u2014 improves the soil's ability to retain water \nand nutrients and store carbon and raises its fertility. \nUsing high-quality compost or digestate to replace \nmineral nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertiliser \nreduces environmental impacts as a result of avoiding \nproduction of virgin mineral fertilisers. An estimated \n134\u00a0000 tonnes of nitrogen and 44\u00a0000 tonnes of \nphosphate are currently lost through the bio-waste \ndisposed of in mixed municipal waste in Europe.\n\nMore and more consumer products, mainly certain \nplastic bags, but also some other products, are labelled \nas 'compostable' or 'biodegradable'. Strategies \n\nfor the use of compostable bags for collecting biowaste vary across Europe. In some countries and \nmunicipalities, they are used as a means to ease \ncollection and reduce contamination with conventional \nplastics, while their use is not accepted in others. \nTheir biodegradation depends on conditions such \nas presence of moisture and oxygen, so their use \nneeds careful consideration and alignment with the \ntreatment infrastructure. For\u00a0example, such plastics \nusually do not biodegrade during anaerobic digestion. \nMoreover, products suitable for industrial composting \ndo not necessarily biodegrade in nature or in people's \nhousehold composting bins. Developing clear and \nconsistent labelling and instructions on using and \ndisposing of biodegradable/compostable plastics is \nof utmost importance, while restrictions for\u00a0certain \napplications may be necessary.\n\nNew opportunities are arising for turning bio-waste \ninto valuable bio-products and biofuels, with \na focus on well-defined bio-waste streams from \nfood processing and agriculture. Much research \nis investigating the many challenges to be tackled. \nAs\u00a0there is often a gap between laboratory research \nand its transfer to industrial-scale commercial \napplication, improving the uptake and application \nof research findings needs collaboration between \nresearchers, industries and governments.\n\f\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nBio-waste \u2014 mainly food and garden waste \u2014 is the \nlargest single component of municipal waste and is also \ngenerated in agriculture and industry. Diverging policies \nfor this important waste fraction are found in European \ncountries, and its management varies depending \non local conditions and capabilities. Many European \ncountries have already implemented the separate \ncollection of bio-waste, but some are still searching for \nthe best practices and means of implementation.\n\nIn 2018, the revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) \n(EU, 2008, 2018b) introduced several substantial \nchanges relevant for bio-waste:\n\n\u2022 an obligation for all EU Member States to collect \nbio-waste separately or ensure recycling at source \nfrom the end of 2023 onwards;\n\n\u2022 new targets for the preparation for reuse and \nrecycling of municipal waste which, in combination \nwith the Landfill Directive's landfill reduction \ntargets for municipal waste (EU, 1999, 2018a), are \nunlikely to be met without proper management of \nbio-waste;\n\n\u2022 an aspirational target to reduce food waste in \nline with Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 to \nhalve food waste by 2030, and a mandate for the \nEuropean Commission to propose a binding food \nwaste reduction target by the end of 2023;\n\n\u2022 a requirement for EU Member States to measure \nand report food waste generation annually, starting \nin 2020, and to adopt specific food waste prevention \nprogrammes.\n\nIn addition, sustainable bio-waste management will \nsubstantially contribute to the objective of halving the \namount of residual (non-recycled) municipal waste by \n2030, as proposed in the 2020 circular economy action \nplan (EC, 2020b). In accordance with the European \npolicy, national, regional and local policymakers \nand stakeholders have important decisions to make \nin the next couple of years about the sustainable \nmanagement of bio-waste. This report aims to \ncontribute to the knowledge base and support these \nprocesses by sharing experience and best practice.\n\nBio-waste has considerable potential to contribute \nmore widely to the circular bioeconomy through, for \nexample, being processed into fertiliser, soil improvers \nand non-fossil fuels. Under the EU's circular economy \naction plan (EC, 2015b), efforts to use bio-waste \nas a resource have gained additional traction, and \ntechnical developments going beyond the current end \nproducts of bio-waste treatment, such as biogas and \ncompost, are emerging. Other new or revised rules \nrelevant to bio-waste and its resource-efficient use \ninclude the Fertilising Products Regulation, amended \nin 2019 (EU, 2019b) and the Single-Use Plastics \nDirective (EU,\u00a02019a).\u00a0Food waste is also included in \nthe European Commission's monitoring framework \nof\u00a0indicators for the circular economy (EC, 2017).\n\nIn many countries, action on waste prevention gives \nhigh priority to food waste prevention. Countries \nare implementing policy measures ranging from \necolabelling, through improving consumer awareness, \nto increasing the responsibilities of producers and \ndistributors. The new reporting requirement on food \nwaste generation introduced under the WFD will for \nthe first time enable tracking of the progress of such \npolicies across Europe in a harmonised way.\n\nThis EEA report, produced in collaboration with the \nEuropean Environment Information and Observation \nNetwork (Eionet) countries and the European Topic \nCentre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy \n(ETC/WMGE), continues the work at the EEA on the \nbio- and circular economies. It builds upon the 2018 \nEEA report The circular economy and the bioeconomy \n\u2014\u00a0partners in sustainability (EEA, 2018) and information \ndrawn from Eurostat and the European Reference \nModel on Municipal Waste (ETC/WMGE, 2019b) \n(Box\u00a01.1). It describes the current state of play in \ncountries, extending the information on bio-waste \nmanagement systems and policies with information \non\u00a0specific initiatives related to the new legal \nrequirements on food waste.\n\nThe report starts by explaining why it is important \nto address bio-waste (Chapter 2), followed by an \noverview\u00a0of current collection and treatment systems \nfor bio-waste in Europe and their outcomes (Chapter\u00a03). \nChapter 4 focuses on food waste and describes \n\n1 Introduction\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n10 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nrecent policy developments and best practice in \nfood waste prevention. As ensuring the high quality \nof the outputs of bio-waste treatment is of utmost \nimportance, Chapter 5 outlines the current state of \n\nquality management of compost and digestate and \nof creating a market for them in European countries. \nFinally, looking ahead, Chapter 6 explores some trends \nin innovative valorisation schemes for bio-waste.\n\n \nBox 1.1 Sources of information\n\nThe analyses in this report are based on the literature, countries' waste prevention programmes, information provided by \nthe EEA member and cooperating countries through the Eionet national reference centres on Waste (NRCs) and information \nprovided by stakeholders. The information from the countries was elicited through a survey that was carried out in spring \n2019.\u00a0Annex 1 shows the countries/regions that responded to the survey and the survey questions.\n\nAs well as data provided by the NRCs on waste through the survey, the assessment uses Eurostat data, complemented by \ndata\u00a0drawn from the European Reference Model on Municipal Waste (ETC/WMGE, 2019b).\n\nNo claim is made that this report covers all aspects of municipal bio-waste management and prevention, as countries may \nhave\u00a0additional related policies, instruments or targets that are not captured in the report.\n\f\n11\n\nWhy is bio-waste relevant?\n\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nThe Waste Framework Directive (WFD) defines \nbio-waste as biodegradable garden and park waste; \nfood and kitchen waste from households, restaurants, \ncaterers and retail premises; and comparable waste \nfrom food-processing plants. This report focuses on \nfood and garden waste from households and similar \npublic and commercial activities such as food services.\n\nBio-waste represents an important share of European \nmunicipal waste generation. In 2017, the EU-28 \n(28\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States) generated 249 million tonnes of \nmunicipal solid waste (Eurostat, 2019), of which about \n34\u00a0%, or 86 million tonnes, was bio-waste (Figure 2.1). \nThis includes both bio-waste that is separately collected \nand bio-waste collected together with mixed (residual) \nwaste but excludes home-composted bio-waste.\n\nBecause of its considerable volume, the EU's common \nobjectives for waste management cannot be met \nwithout addressing the bio-waste stream. If not \nmanaged well, this voluminous waste stream poses \nsignificant environmental and economic threats \n(Pubule et al., 2015). For example, biodegradable waste, \nincluding bio-waste, is a key source of greenhouse gas \nemissions from landfill sites, corresponding to about \n\n3\u00a0% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions (EEA, 2019a). \nAddressing municipal bio-waste is also crucial for \nmoving towards the new targets defined in the 2018 \nWFD. This directive introduces new targets regarding \nrecycling and preparation for reuse: by weight, at least \n55\u00a0% by 2025, 60\u00a0% by 2030 and 65\u00a0% by 2035.\n\nFood waste is an important component of the \nmunicipal bio-waste stream. It can be divided into \navoidable and non-avoidable food waste (Chapter 4). \nPreventing avoidable food waste is perceived as an \nethical responsibility, because it is associated with \nthe misappropriation of economic resources and \ntheir resulting negative environmental externalities \n(Philippidis et al., 2019). For this reason, the European \nCommission's bioeconomy strategy has started to focus \non food systems. The strategy aims to demonstrate \nhow food waste can be transformed into valuable \nresources and to create innovation and incentives \nto help retailers and consumers to cut food waste \nby 50\u00a0%\u00a0by weight by 2030 and contribute to the \ntransition to a circular economy (EC, 2018a). Most \nrecently, a\u00a0forthcoming EU 'Farm to fork' strategy was \nannounced, which is intended to address all stages of \nthe food chain, including food waste (EC, 2019a).\n\n2 Why is bio-waste relevant?\n\n\u00a9 Brendan Killeen\n\f\nWhy is bio-waste relevant?\n\n12 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nFood waste represents 60\u00a0% of the total municipal \nbio-waste in the EU-28 and garden waste accounts for \n35\u00a0%, while the remaining 5\u00a0% of municipal bio-waste \nis classified as 'other'. On average in 2017, 43\u00a0% of \nmunicipal bio-waste was collected separately, while \n57\u00a0% of bio-waste ended up in mixed municipal waste \nand was thus lost for recycling.\n\nWhile Figure 2.1 shows the picture for the EU-28, \nper capita bio-waste generation varies considerably \namong European countries (Figure 2.2). Hungary and \nNorth Macedonia have the lowest levels of bio-waste \ngeneration per person, 75 and 79\u00a0kg respectively, \nwhile the share of bio-waste in total municipal waste \ngenerated varies between 17\u00a0% in Hungary and 58\u00a0% \nin Montenegro. However, when interpreting country \ndifferences, the degree of uncertainty and lack of \nharmonisation of waste composition data should be \nkept in mind. \n\nThe data in Figure 2.2 show the wide diversity in \nterms\u00a0of volumes of bio-waste generated, as well \nas\u00a0the relative importance of bio-waste in municipal \nwaste generation. The differences across countries \nare\u00a0influenced by a range of factors, including:\n\n\u2022 There are differences in how countries report \nmunicipal bio-waste from non-household sources, \nfor example to what extent garden waste from \nparks and food waste from the hospitality sector \nis\u00a0included.\n\n\u2022 The level of urbanisation of a country or region. \nFor example, in the Munich region, people living \nin low-density areas produce more and cleaner \nbio-waste, mainly driven by the higher share of \ngarden waste (Langer, 2017).\n\n\u2022 Separate collection system. The introduction of \nseparate collection of bio-waste tends to lead \nto higher amounts of bio-waste in the waste \nmanagement system, as some consumers divert \nbio-waste from home composting to the collection \nbins (EC, 2015a).\n\n\u2022 Prevalence of home-composting. Composting \nat home decreases the volumes of bio-waste to \nbe collected and managed. This is the case, for \nexample, in Slovenia, which has one of the lowest \nshares of bio-waste in municipal waste generated \nin Europe. In Slovenia, producers of bio-waste are \nencouraged to compost it themselves. If they do \nnot do so, they have to separate it for separate \ncollection by public services (EC, 2015a). Home \ncomposting is not included in the data presented \nin\u00a0this report because of a lack of data registered \nat\u00a0country level.\n\nImpacts of bio-waste\n\nThe generation and management of these volumes \nof bio-waste, especially food waste as the main \nconstituent of bio-waste (see Section 4.1), have various \nenvironmental, social and economic impacts.\n\nThe food value chain is responsible for a large share \nof life-cycle environmental impacts related to total \nconsumption in the EU (EEA, 2012). Food production \nrequires the use of resources including land, water, fuel \nand raw materials. The application of fertilisers and the \nraising of livestock are major sources of environmental \npressures from generating greenhouse gas emissions \nto the release of nutrients. In addition, other steps in \nthe food supply chain, such as storage, transport and \npreparation, contribute to the environmental impacts \nof food. It is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions \nrelated to food losses and wastes in the EU-28 are \nresponsible for 15-22\u00a0% of the total life-cycle emissions \nof the food consumed (Scherhaufer et al., 2015, 2018). \nScherhaufer et al. (2018) also estimated that a global \nwarming potential of 186 million tonnes of carbon \ndioxide equivalent (Mt\u00a0CO2e) can be attributed to food \nwaste in Europe, or on average about 2.1 tonnes of \nCO2e per tonne of food waste.\n\nFood that is produced and marketed but not eaten \ncauses unnecessary environmental pressures along \nits whole value chain. Most of the environmental \npressures related to food waste are generated in \nthe production phase of the food. 73\u00a0% of food \nwaste-related greenhouse gas emissions are derived \nfrom food production, 6\u00a0% from food processing, \n7\u00a0% from retail and distribution and 8\u00a0% from food \npreparation and consumption, with the disposal of \nfood waste contributing just 6\u00a0%. Meat and dairy \nproducts make the highest contribution to the overall \nenvironmental impacts of food waste in terms of \nglobal warming potential, acidification potential and \neutrophication potential (Scherhaufer et al., 2018).\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations (FAO) estimates that approximately one third \nof the edible food produced for human consumption \nis\u00a0either lost or wasted globally (Gustavsson \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02011). In addition to the environmental \nimpacts,\u00a0the generation of food waste also has social \nand economic impacts. It results in not only the loss \nof\u00a0natural resources but also economic losses for \nfarmers, consumers and other stakeholders in the \nfood value chain. This leads to higher food prices \nfor consumers, which increases food insecurity \nby making\u00a0it less accessible to the poorest groups \n(Gustavsson et al., 2011; Manfredi et al., 2015).\n\f\nWhy is bio-waste relevant?\n\n13Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nFigure 2.1 Bio-waste in municipal waste and how it is collected, EU-28, 2017\n\nSource:  ETC/WMGE compilation based on data provided by the European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet) through \nan EEA and European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE) survey (ETC/WMGE, 2019a), complemented \nwith data from the European Reference Model on Municipal Waste (ETC/WMGE, 2019b) and Eurostat (2019).\n\nFood\n100\n\nOther \nbio-waste\n\n8\n\nGarden\n59\n\nNon-bio-waste\n321\n\nCollected in mixed\nmunicipal waste\n\n97\n\nCollected separately\n71\n\nTotal bio-waste in\n municipal waste\n\n168\n\nTotal municipal waste\n 488 \n\nUnit = kg/person\n\nFigure 2.2  Municipal bio-waste generation per person and share of bio-waste in municipal waste \ngenerated by country, 2017\n\nNotes:  *Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99.

If demand for food is reduced by preventing \nfood waste, the environmental impacts of producing, \nprocessing and transporting food decrease. Preventing \nfood waste in households and in the hospitality \nsector has the greatest indirect effect in mitigating \nenvironmental pressures. This is, first, because of the \nhigh share of potentially avoidable food waste at the \nhousehold and food service sector levels in terms \nof weight (see Figure 4.2) and, second, because the \nenvironmental impacts at the consumer stage include \nall the accumulated impacts from earlier stages of \nthe supply chain (Scherhaufer et al., 2018). However, \nresponsibility for preventing food waste lies with all \nstages of the food value chain.\n\nIt is important to collect unpreventable bio-waste \nseparately and choose a treatment option that is \nsustainable (Scherhaufer et al., 2018). Landfilling \nof bio-waste has very high negative environmental \nimpacts. In landfills, biodegradable waste decomposes \nand produces gas that mainly consists of methane, \na\u00a0powerful greenhouse gas, and landfilling of \nseparately collected bio-waste or of bio-waste within \nresidual municipal waste without pre-treatment is not \n\nallowed in the EU according to the WFD and the Landfill \nDirective (EC, 2008).\n\nIn a circular economy, bio-waste is directed to \ntreatment options that use the waste as a source \nof valuable resources such as nutrients, organic \nsubstances and energy. For example, composting \nand anaerobic digestion are biological treatment \nmethods that may be classified as recycling when the \ncompost or digestate produced is used as a recycled \nproduct, material or substance, and, in the case of \nits use on land, it results in benefits to agriculture \nor ecological improvement (EC, 2008). Anaerobic \ndigestion also produces biogas that can be either \nused to generate heat and electricity or upgraded \ninto a low-carbon biofuel. There are also other \nemerging and innovative technologies that aim to \nvalorise bio-waste as products or energy (Chapter 6). \nIn addition to the environmental benefits, separate \ncollection and recycling of bio-waste may also create \nnew employment opportunities (EC,\u00a02008; Maina \net al.,\u00a02017). Generating biogas from agricultural \nresidues and bio-waste is a well-established practice in \nmany countries and has, for example, been mentioned \nby North Macedonia (Eionet, 2019) as an opportunity \nto both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create \nemployment in rural areas.\n\f\n15\n\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nThe revised WFD introduced a new requirement for \nbio-waste separation. By 31\u00a0December 2023, bio-waste \nmust either be separated and recycled at source \nor collected separately and not mixed with other \ntypes of\u00a0waste (EU, 2018b). This aims to increase the \nquality and uptake of secondary raw materials. In \naddition, as from 2027, compost derived from mixed \nmunicipal waste will no longer count towards achieving \ncompliance with the recycling targets for municipal \nwaste by 2027. Bio-waste consists of food waste, \ngarden waste and other bio-waste. Figure 3.1 shows the \ncomposition of municipal bio-waste for 32 European \ncountries.\n\nAgain, there are large differences in the composition of \ncountries' bio-waste, and the reasons behind them are \noften difficult to explain because of multiple influencing \nfactors. First, the bio-waste collection system is likely \nto have an important impact: when garden waste \nis collected separately, the share of garden waste \ntends to be higher. This is the case in, for\u00a0example, \nCzechia, which has the second largest share of garden \nwaste in its bio-waste. Moreover, bio-waste that is \nhome composted is not included in these data. In \naddition to the waste collection and management \nstrategy, external factors can also affect the bio-waste \ncomposition. Examples of such factors are seasonality \n(with seasonal garden waste streams), climate (Edjabou \net al., 2018), the level of urbanisation (Shi et al., 2013), \ngeographical area, local traditions, and economic, social \nand political aspects (Di Maria et al., 2018).\n\nSome of the differences are, however, due to different \nways of collecting data. Bio-waste composition, and \nwaste composition in general, is not a regularly reported \ndata flow, and some countries' data include mixed food \nand garden waste categorised as 'other bio-waste'. \nDifferences in the way countries include waste from \nparks in reporting municipal waste also affect the data. \nThe analysis therefore provides an approximate picture \nof the relevance of the different waste streams.\n\n3.1 Collection of bio-waste\n\n3.1.1 Separation and composting at source \n(home\u00a0composting)\n\nSustainable treatment of bio-waste first of all requires \nit to be separated from residual waste at source. \nIn principle, the most sustainable way of bio-waste \nmanagement is home composting or community \ncomposting at the local level if it is done properly. This \ncan decrease the need for separate bio-waste collection \n(EC, 2015a) and thus reduce the waste transport and \nmanagement costs (V\u00e1zquez and Soto, 2017) and the \nassociated environmental impacts. This is especially \nrelevant in sparsely populated areas. Citizens may \nbenefit from a good-quality fertiliser and soil improver \n(compost) for use in their gardens or vegetable plots. For \nexample, 48\u00a0% of people in Slovenia were reported to \nhave home composting systems (\u017ditnik and Vidic, 2016).\n\nThe compost produced by households or small \ncommunities (such as blocks of flats in small villages) \ncan typically be used at the local level. This is a textbook \nexample of closing loops locally. Especially in remote \nareas, this kind of de-centralised system can offer \nan opportunity for bio-waste treatment (Panaretou \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02019). Home composting, however, requires \npeople to have some knowledge of good composting \npractice to avoid unnecessary environmental impacts \nand to ensure good-quality compost. Odour and \ngreenhouse gases (e.g. methane, nitrous oxide) can \nbe emitted during the process if not well managed \n(Col\u00f3n et al., 2012). For sanitary reasons, animal-based \nfood waste should, however, be excluded from home \ncomposting (e.g. animal-based food waste accounts for \n21\u00a0% of food waste in Denmark (Edjabou et al., 2018)).\n\nTherefore, the success of home and community \ncomposting depends on the quality of waste separation \nand citizens' management of the composting process. \nCommunity composting as typically implemented in \n\n3 Bio-waste management in Europe \u2014 \nstatus and trends\n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n16 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nFigure 3.1  Composition of municipal bio-waste for 32 EEA member and cooperating countries, 2017\n\nNotes:  *Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99.  \n \n'Other bio-waste' may include mixed food and garden waste.\n\nSource:  ETC/WMGE compilation based on data provided by the European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet) through \nan EEA and European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE) survey (ETC/WMGE, 2019a), Eurostat \n(2020), and the European Reference Model on Municipal Waste (ETC/WMGE, 2019b) for Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, \nEstonia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSweden\n\nSpain\n\nSlovenia\n\nSlovakia\n\nSerbia\n\nRomania\n\nPortugal\n\nPoland\n\nNetherlands\n\nMalta\n\nLuxembourg\n\nLithuania\n\nLatvia\n\nKosovo*\n\nItaly\n\nIreland\n\nIceland\n\nHungary\n\nGreece\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nFinland\n\nEstonia\n\nDenmark\n\nCzechia\n\nCyprus\n\nCroatia\n\nBulgaria\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBelgium\n\nFood waste Garden waste Other bio-waste\n\n%\n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n17Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nurban areas requires additional organisational effort \n(Dri et al., 2018). Awareness-raising campaigns and \ntraining can help to motivate people to separate and \nmanage their bio-waste sustainably (Eionet, 2019). For \nexample, Flanders in Belgium has trained more than \n5\u00a0000 volunteers in the past 25 years to help citizens \npractise home composting and closed loop gardening, \nand 41\u00a0% of Flemish households compost at home \n(VLACO, 2020). In a survey, 84\u00a0% of home composters \nreported that they had never experienced problems \nwith composting or the compost (VLACO, 2018).\n\nSeveral examples illustrate this option: the Revitaliza \nprogramme in the Spanish province of Pontevedra \nadopts a decentralised system \u2014 a combination \nof home composting, community composting and \nsmall composting facilities, including extensive \nawareness raising and training of 'compost masters' \n(Mato\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019). The Decisive (2018) project aims to \nanalyse and demonstrate options for decentralised \nbio-waste management systems in Catalonia, Spain, \nand the city of Lyon, France. A community composting \nproject in the city of Bratislava, Slovakia, demonstrated \nthe importance of cooperation among the various \nstakeholders and citizens interested in composting \ntheir own bio-waste, and resulted in a reduction in the \namount of bio-waste in mixed municipal waste. The \nFrench Environment and Energy Management Agency \n(ADEME) has set up a platform for sharing experiences \nfrom small-scale bio-waste management and food \nwaste\u00a0prevention projects from all over the country. \nOverall, good cooperation and good information on \nthe source separation scheme can lead to high levels of \nrecovery of bio-waste and related cost savings in waste \nservices (Panaretou et al., 2017).\n\nFor most European countries, data on home \ncomposting are currently not available. However, \nEU Member States have the option to include \nhome-composted bio-waste when reporting their \nrates\u00a0of recycling municipal waste, as required by \nthe Waste Framework Directive (WFD), following the \ncalculation method adopted in 2019 (EC, 2019b). \nFor\u00a0those EU Member States that make use of this \noption, data on home composting will become \navailable\u00a0in the\u00a0coming years.\n\n3.1.2 Separate collection\n\nSeparate collection is a prerequisite for using \nbio-waste\u00a0as a resource in a circular way. Collecting \nbio-waste separately from other municipal waste \nkeeps\u00a0the levels of impurities and contamination \ndown\u00a0as far as possible and enables its use as valuable \nsecondary resources such as soil improvers, organic \nfertilisers and biogas (Xevgenos et al., 2015; Fricke \n\net al., 2017). The European Commission will propose \nto harmonise separate waste collection systems \n(EC,\u00a02020b).\n\nIntroducing separate bio-waste collection usually \nrequires an initial investment by the public sector, \nbut cost-benefit analyses have shown that the overall \neconomic outcome for both citizens and the waste \nmanagement organisation is positive if the whole waste \nmanagement system is optimised (Bourka et al., 2015; \nRodrigues et al., 2015; Niskanen and Kemppi, 2019). \nThe actual costs depend on many factors, including the \ncollection system (door-to-door collection or containers \non the roadside), population density, collection \nfrequency and weather conditions.\n\nOptimisation of the system could entail reducing \nthe collection frequency for residual waste, \ncreating economic incentives for waste prevention \nand participating in separate collection, as well \nas tailoring\u00a0the system to local circumstances \n(Ministry\u00a0of\u00a0Agriculture, Food and Environment, \nGovernment of Spain, 2013), including ensuring \nappropriate sanitary conditions. Analysis from a large \nnumber of municipalities shows that higher recycling \nrates for municipal waste, including bio-waste, can \nbe achieved without increasing the costs of the waste \nmanagement system (Giavini, 2017). The revenues \nfrom the sales of renewable energy, soil improvers \nand fertilisers produced from bio-waste can cover \npart of the collection and treatment costs (Niskanen \nand Kemppi, 2019). However, such products have to \ncompete with virgin materials, fuels and energy, which \nare partly subsidised and their prices often do not take \naccount of the environmental damage they cause. \n\nFigure 3.2 presents separate bio-waste collection rates \nin 32 European countries in 2017. About 50\u00a0% of the \nmunicipal bio-waste generated is collected separately \nin the countries that provided data (weighted average). \nThe remaining 50\u00a0% of municipal bio-waste is collected \nwith residual (mixed) waste. The separate collection \nrates vary from 80\u00a0% or more in Austria and Slovenia \nto less than 10\u00a0% in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cyprus, North \nMacedonia, Portugal, Spain and Turkey, demonstrating \nthat, at an individual country level there remains ample \nroom for improvement. Malta recently introduced \nseparate collection of bio-waste across the country but \ndata on quantities were not available.\n\nIn many countries, pilot projects on introducing \nseparate collection of bio-waste or food waste are \ncarried out in selected cities or regions, or separate \ncollection is already established in some municipalities \nor regions, for example in Poland, Portugal and Serbia \n(Eionet, 2019). Others carry out projects to improve or \nfurther develop already existing systems, for example \n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n18 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nin the Brussels Capital Region and Flanders in Belgium \nand in the Netherlands.\n\nConsolidated data on the trends in the separate \ncollection of bio-waste across Europe are not available. \nHowever, the amount of municipal waste that is \ncomposted or anaerobically digested \u2014 which might \ninclude some mixed municipal waste treated in \nmechanical-biological treatment plants \u2014 increased by \n52\u00a0% in the period 2004-2018 (Eurostat, 2020). Collection \nof data on separately collected bio-waste is needed for \nmonitoring the effectiveness of bio-waste management.\n\n3.1.3 Introducing separate collection of bio-waste\n\nThe implementation of a successful system for separate \nbio-waste collection and management requires a \ncomprehensive strategy, taking into account local \ncircumstances. The following key factors play an \nimportant role (EC, 2000, 2015a):\n\n\u2022 Bio-waste types targeted, for example food waste, \ngarden waste, other bio-wastes. Some regions might \nneed to focus more on specific types of municipal \nbio-waste (e.g. food waste in cities).\n\n\u2022 A clear (measurable and achievable) set of \nobjectives is set out.\n\n\u2022 Selection of collection system. Various solutions \nhave emerged including door-to-door systems, \ndrop-off points in the streets, civic amenity sites, \non-demand-collection.\n\n\u2022 Economic incentives are offered to separately \ncollect bio-waste, for example pay-as-you-throw \nsystems.\n\n\u2022 A treatment infrastructure for bio-waste is  \ncreated.\n\n\u2022 Direction towards waste treatment. Separately \ncollected bio-waste can be directed to treatment \ninstallations at community or a more centralised \nlevel.\n\n\u2022 Financial details. What costs will be accounted for by \nwhich parties, and what kind of revenue scheme will \nbe applied (e.g. do citizens contribute or not?).\n\n\u2022 Administration of the scheme. A successful separate \nbio-waste collection system requires detailed \nplanning and design, involving municipalities or \nlocal governments.\n\n\u2022 Targeted territory. This should take into account \nlocal parameters such as population density, ratio of \ntourists to residents, presence of hospitals, schools, \nhotels and restaurants, and presence of (urban) \ngardens (Decisive, 2018).\n\n\u2022 Awareness raising. Separate collection systems will \nrequire good publicity and knowledge transfer to \ncitizens to guarantee proper source separation, \nincluding, for example, targeting schools. This is \none of the key recommendations arising from a \nreview of successful separate bio-waste collection \nsystems (EC, 2015a). Awareness raising should be \ncombined with creating a positive image of the \nwaste management authority or company. This \nis particularly important when a new separate \ncollection system is introduced.\n\nHigh levels of knowledge and engagement among \ncitizens are crucial factors for successful separate waste \ncollection systems (Xevgenos et al., 2015). In general, \n\n \nBox 3.1  The example of separate bio-waste collection in Munich, Germany\n\nIn Germany, on average 64\u00a0% of municipal bio-waste is collected separately. The separate collection systems show regional \ndifferences, with parts of the country having a long history of separate bio-waste collection. In Munich for example, the \nWaste Management Corporation introduced the concept of separate bio-waste collection in 1988 (Langer, 2017) and, \nfollowing a\u00a0testing phase, instituted a three-bin system in 1994. This system collected organic waste and paper waste \nseparately from residual waste \u2014\u00a0and today the system has been modernised and expanded. The Corporation also invested \nin a biogas plant in\u00a02003, which was enlarged in 2008, and a soil-processing plant in 2012. In 2017, Munich ran a campaign \nto increase the amount of bio-waste collected. The dry-fermentation biogas plant currently processes 22\u00a0000 tonnes of \nfood and garden waste per year, resulting in 2\u00a0600 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity, plus process heat, and 7\u00a00008\u00a0000 tonnes of compost per year. These figures indicate the economic potential of these techniques (Langer, 2017). If the \nMunich production figures are extrapolated to all European countries included in Figure 3.2 (ignoring the composition and \ncleanliness of\u00a0the bio-waste), 52 million tonnes of bio-waste, which\u00a0is currently not collected separately, could result\u00a0in the \nproduction of about 8\u00a0000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity per year and 23 million tonnes of compost.\n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n19Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nFigure 3.2  Bio-waste collected separately as a share of bio-waste generated (bio-waste capture rate), \nby\u00a0country\tfor\t32\tEEA\tmember\tand\tcooperating\tcountries,\t2017\n\nNotes:  Excluding Albania, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Malta, Montenegro, Norway and Serbia due to a lack of data.

First, the campaign \nneeds to convince people to separate their bio-waste. \n\nSecond, to avoid impurities and contamination, the \ncampaign needs to educate people about what is \nallowed in the bio-waste bin.\n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n20 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nIn Munich, for example (Box 3.1), a campaign was set \nup and repeated several times, which resulted in very \nlow impurity levels. Despite that, its citizens'\u00a0overall \nknowledge of bio-waste separation and recycling \nremains low, as reported by the Munich Waste \nManagement Corporation (Langer,\u00a02017). In\u00a0the\u00a0Irish \ncity of Sligo, an awareness-raising campaign \nsignificantly increased the number of households \nparticipating in separate bio-waste collection and \nreduced the level of impurities from 18\u00a0% to 1\u00a0% \nand the share of bio-waste in residual waste by \n10 percentage points (Eionet, 2019). The type of \ncollection system is also important for the level of \nimpurities. Door-to-door collection systems appear \nto encourage people to source-separate bio-waste \nbetter than drop-off systems with containers in the \nstreet (EC,\u00a02015a). The level of improper materials \nsuch as plastics, paper and glass reduces compost \nquality, including contamination with heavy \nmetals; thus, efforts to avoid such materials in the \nbio-waste are important (Rodrigues et al., 2020). \nThe proliferation\u00a0of\u00a0plastic products labelled as \ncompostable or biodegradable may create a specific \nchallenge for separate collection and compost quality \n(Box 3.2).\n\nOther success factors are providing economic \nincentives, such as higher fees for the disposal of \n\nnon-separated waste, and regulatory measures \n(e.g.\u00a0incineration bans, restrictions or mandatory \nsource separation) (Xevgenos et al., 2015).\n\nA comparative analysis of 19 different cases in Europe \nalso demonstrated that the efficiency of separate \nbio-waste collection systems, assessed by performance \nover time, improves with the systems'\u00a0maturity \n(EC,\u00a02015a). Nevertheless, the study also found a \nnumber of cases that managed to achieve rapid \nimprovements in separate collection in a short period \n(e.g. Ljubljana). Finally, municipalities with low population \ndensity achieve significantly higher participation and \nengagement rates in their separate collection systems. \nHowever, several European case studies indicate that \nmunicipalities with low population density should pay \nspecific attention to the cost-efficiency of their separate \nwaste collection systems, mainly because of transport \ndistances (see, for example, Lombrano, 2009; Carvalho \nand Marques, 2014; Guerrini et al., 2017; Exposito and \nVelasco, 2018; Bartolacci et al., 2019).\n\n3.2 Treatment of separately collected \nbio-waste\n\nThe potential benefits of separate bio-waste collection \ncan only be reaped if separately collected bio-waste \n\n \nBox 3.2  Compostable and biodegradable plastics and bio-waste management\n\nMore and more consumer products, mainly plastic bags, packaging, single-use cups, plates and cutlery, are labelled as \ncompostable or biodegradable. 'Compostable' in most cases refers to compostability in controlled industrial composting \nplants,\u00a0while the term 'biodegradable' is used for plastics that decompose under certain other conditions in the open \nenvironment. Many municipalities and waste collectors require citizens to use certified compostable plastic bags for collecting \nbio-waste, while others do not allow such bags. Strategies also depend on the bio-waste treatment infrastructure. Using \ncompostable/biodegradable plastics for selected specific items that are mixed or attached to food waste such as fruit stickers \nor tea bags might help to reduce impurities and ease food waste collection (Crippa et al., 2019). Nevertheless, all requirements \nof the EU\u00a0Single-Use Plastics Directive (EU, 2019a) also apply to compostable/biodegradable plastics.\n\nHowever, this comes with a number of challenges. Several industry standards and related certification schemes exist for testing \nthe compostability and biodegradability of plastics. If a plastic item is to actually decompose, this depends heavily on the \nmaterial's composition and the conditions it is exposed to, such as moisture, oxygen, presence of microorganisms and duration \nof the process. Many plastics currently labelled as compostable or biodegradable are designed to decompose under controlled \nconditions in industrial bio-waste treatment plants but do not decompose, or only do so to a limited extent, in anaerobic \ndigestion conditions (Kern et al., 2017), in small compost boxes in people's gardens, in soil or in water. Biodegradability in the  \nmarine environment remains difficult.\n\nMoreover, the ambiguous term 'bioplastics' is used sometimes for compostable/biodegradable plastics and sometimes for \nplastics made from bio-based materials such as starch. However, plastics made from bio-based materials are not necessarily \ncompostable or biodegradable. The proliferation of different labels and claims might therefore confuse people. This can create \nthe risk of contaminating compost and contamination of the environment if people misunderstand such labels as a 'licence \nto litter'. The new circular economy action plan, adopted in March 2020 (EC, 2020b), commits the European Commission to \ndeveloping a policy framework on the sourcing, labelling and use of bio-based plastics and on the use of biodegradable or \ncompostable plastics, including their labelling.\n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n21Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nis also treated properly. Hence, a region's bio-waste \ntreatment capacity must be aligned with the bio-waste \ngenerated and collected separately.\n\n3.2.1 Treatment paths\n\nThe most common treatment methods for separately \ncollected bio-waste, in line with circular economy \nprinciples, are composting and anaerobic digestion:\n\n\u2022 Composting is a process carried out in the presence \nof oxygen, usually either in open-air windrows \nor in-vessel. Through biodegradation of organic \nsolids, a humic substance is generated that can be \nused as fertiliser, soil improver or a growing media \nconstituent. The process works best with a good \nmixture of easily degradable, wet organic substances \nsuch as food waste and structure-improving organic \nmatter such as garden waste.\n\n\u2022 Anaerobic digestion is a process carried out in \nclosed vessels without oxygen, which produces \nbiogas that can be used to generate electricity or \nheat, or upgraded into a fuel and a digestate that \ncan be used as an organic fertiliser or soil improver. \nThe process can use different kinds of organic input \nmaterials but does not break down lignin, which is \na\u00a0key component of wood (see Canova et al. (2018) \nfor a more detailed description).\n\nThe treatment techniques used for municipal \nbio-waste\u00a0are usually also applicable to bio-wastes \nfrom other sources (e.g. from the food industry \n(Montoneri,\u00a02017)). For this reason, municipal \nbio-waste\u00a0is often treated along with other bio-waste \nstreams. The bio-waste treatment technology that \nallows the greatest recovery of both material and \nenergy is generally the environmentally preferable \noption. Based on life-cycle analysis, the European \nCommission's Joint Research Centre (JRC, 2011) \nidentified a 'hierarchy' of options for bio-waste but \nstresses that life-cycle analysis of any given situation \nmay produce results that deviate from that hierarchy.\n\nWhile waste prevention and reuse (e.g. redistribution \nor use as animal feed) is clearly environmentally most \npreferable, anaerobic digestion of separately collected \nbio-waste (excluding some non-digestible wastes) is the \nsecond-best option followed by composting, because \nanaerobic digestion recovers both materials and \nenergy. Nevertheless, reaping these benefits requires \nthe following: compost is needed as a soil improver, \ncompost obtained from direct composting and from \ncomposting of digestate are similar in composition and \nquantity, energy recovery from the biogas produced \ndisplaces fossil fuel-based energy production, and the \n\ndigestion process is well managed. Comparing different \ndisposal routes for food waste, a Dutch life-cycle \nanalysis found the best results for material and energy \nrecovery were achieved by composting with\u00a0anaerobic \ndigestion as pre-treatment (Odegard\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015). \nHowever, in regions with low levels of organic \nmatter in agricultural soils, composting might be the \nenvironmentally preferable option.\n\nAnaerobic digestion is not always technically feasible, \nfor example for high shares of garden waste. Although \ngarden waste can be treated by anaerobic digestion, it \noften reduces the energy yield of the process because \nof the presence of lignin, which does not break down \nwithout oxygen. When anaerobic digestion is not \n(technically) feasible, composting of bio-waste should be \nassessed against energy recovery (JRC, 2011). Life-cycle \nanalysis has proven to be a useful tool in this context, \nenabling comparison of the environmental benefits \nof material recovery with the environmental benefits \nof energy recovery. Various parameters play a\u00a0role, \nfor example process efficiency, waste composition, \ntransport distance and the characteristics of the \nelectricity mix replaced. One aspect that currently can \nbe covered only qualitatively in life-cycle analyses is the \nbenefit of compost for soil quality (JRC,\u00a02011).\n\nTypically, countries do not exclusively opt for one \nbio-waste treatment path. Instead they choose a \ncombination of techniques, as this enables them \nto target different types of bio-waste from multiple \nsources.\n\n3.2.2 Treatment capacity\n\nAssessing the capacity for treatment of municipal \nbio-waste in Europe is difficult, as only a limited \nnumber of countries have data available on their \ninstalled and planned treatment capacity for this waste \nfraction. At present, based on information provided \nby 20 countries, representing about 59\u00a0% of the \nmunicipal bio-waste generation in EEA member and \ncooperating countries, the known annual capacity of \ntreatment infrastructure in these countries is 38 million \ntonnes of bio-waste. This encompasses an installed \ncapacity of 21\u00a0million tonnes for the composting of \nbio-waste and an additional 17 million tonnes for \nthe anaerobic digestion of bio-waste. The actual \ntreatment capacity is likely to be considerably higher, \nas a number of European countries did not provide \ndata on the capacity of their treatment infrastructure. \nThese treatment capacities are not exclusively used for \nmunicipal bio-waste treatment. In some installations \nmunicipal bio-waste is treated along with other waste \nstreams including manure, sewage sludge and waste \nfrom the food industry (Eionet, 2019).\n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n22 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nThe 2018 WFD requires the separate collection of \nbio-waste or recycling at source (home composting) \nby\u00a0December 2023. This new obligation, in combination \nwith the new requirements for municipal waste recycling, \nis expected to push more bio-waste in the direction of \nanaerobic digestion and composting, and hence also \nto increase the installed capacity of these treatment \ntechniques. Information about planned capacity \n\u2014 although very limited \u2014 indicates\u00a0an\u00a0increasing \nrelevance of anaerobic digestion\u00a0(ETC/WMGE, 2019a).\n\nThe capacity of the installed bio-waste treatment \ninfrastructure varies considerably across the \n21\u00a0European countries that provided data on this. \nThe\u00a0treatment capacities vary between 356\u00a0kg of \nbio-waste per person and close to zero. Some countries \nindicated that they only provided data on their known \ncapacity for bio-waste treatment, possibly missing out \npart of their installed capacity due to a lack of data.\n\nLinking treatment capacity, which might not only \nbe used to treat municipal bio-waste, to municipal \nbio-waste generation and separate collection provides \nsome valuable insights, bearing in mind that the \nconclusions drawn from these insights are restricted \nby the previously mentioned limitations. However, \nthe countries for which treatment capacity data are \navailable (Figure 3.3) can be broadly categorised into \nthree groups:\n\n\u2022 Sufficient treatment capacity for all municipal \nbio-waste generated: Austria, France, the \nNetherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the United \nKingdom. These countries' treatment capacity \nexceeds the volume of municipal bio-waste \ngenerated. Hence, in the extreme case that all \nmunicipal bio-waste were collected separately, the \ncountry theoretically would be able to treat all of \nthis bio-waste. If a country's installed bio-waste \ntreatment capacity exceeds the municipal bio-waste \ngenerated, this does not imply that the country has \nexcess treatment capacity.\n\n\u2022 Treatment capacity is available for the separately \ncollected municipal bio-waste but not for all of the \nmunicipal bio-waste generated: Belgium, Cyprus, \nHungary, Italy (although its treatment capacity is \nvery close to the volume of bio-waste generated), \nLatvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and \nSpain. These countries are currently able to treat \nall of the separately collected municipal bio-waste, \ngiven their installed treatment capacity. However, \nas separate collection increases, the installed \ntreatment infrastructure will need to be extended. \nCroatia has plenty of anaerobic treatment capacity, \nbut most plants only process animal by-products, \n\nand their spatial distribution does not necessarily \nmatch the location of bio-waste generation.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient treatment capacity for the separately \ncollected municipal bio-waste: Estonia, Greece, \nNorth Macedonia and Turkey. These countries are \ncurrently not able to (theoretically) treat the volume \nof bio-waste generated, nor are they able to treat all \nseparately collected bio-waste. However, bio-waste \nmight be treated in mechanical-biological treatment \nplants or in anaerobic digestion plants that mainly \ntreat agricultural waste, and this capacity might not \nbe included in the reported capacities. Extending \nseparate collection of bio-waste will require the \ninstallation of new treatment capacity.\n\nOn average, in the 21 countries that provided \ninformation, composting facilities currently account \nfor 53\u00a0% of the bio-waste treatment capacity, while \nanaerobic digestion accounts for 47\u00a0%; no data are \navailable on the volume of home composting.\n\nAt country level, however, there are significant \ndifferences (Figure 3.4). Estonia, Greece, Hungary, \nLatvia, North Macedonia and Romania provided data \nonly for their composting infrastructure for municipal \nbio-waste. Anaerobic digestion capacity may exist in \nthese countries. In Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Italy, the \nNetherlands, Slovakia and Spain, composting is the \ndominant treatment route. Only in a few countries, \nespecially Croatia, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden \nand Turkey, do anaerobic digestion capacities exceed \nthose for composting. Finally, it is possible to combine \nbio-waste treatment capacity \u2014 the bio-waste is first \ndigested and then the digestate is composted, for \nexample as happens in Portugal. However, no data are \navailable on\u00a0the prevalence of this combined capacity.\n\nThe uptake of anaerobic digestion can be affected \nby environmental regulations such as the Renewable \nEnergy Directive (EU, 2009, 2018c; Achinas et al., 2017; \nAraya, 2018). The directive requires EU Member States \nto ensure that at least 10\u00a0% of their transport fuels \ncome from renewable sources by 2020 and establishes \nrenewable energy targets for the EU of at least 20\u00a0% by \n2020 and 32\u00a0% by 2030.\n\nComparable policies at national level can \nsimultaneously encourage anaerobic digestion. In \nthe United Kingdom, for example, the introduction \nof the renewable transport fuels obligation, which \nsince 2014 has required fuel suppliers to source 5\u00a0% \nof their fuels from renewable sources, significantly \nencouraged the development of its anaerobic digestion \ncapacity (Allen and Wentworth, 2011). In addition, \nAraya (2018) indicated that other types of policies that \ngovern land use and waste disposal can also encourage \n\f\nBio-waste management in Europe \u2014 status and trends\n\n23Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nFigure 3.3  Bio-waste generation and treatment capacities for 21 EEA member and cooperating \ncountries, 2017 \n\nNote:  Home composting is not included because of a lack of data.

In the future, \ntechnological advancements in the field of anaerobic \ndigestion are also expected to increase its potential and \nimprove its economic viability (Fricke et al., 2017).\n\nCurrently, composting and anaerobic digestion are \nthe technologies most commonly used for managing \n\nbio-waste. In the future, bio-waste could increasingly \nbe used as a source of higher value products in line \nwith the principle of the circular economy, namely \nto keep the value of products and materials in the \neconomy as far as possible. For example, in Denmark, \nGermany, Italy, and Norway, methane from anaerobic \ndigestion plants is used to produce automotive fuels \nand for domestic purposes, or it is fed into the gas grid \nafter purification (Eionet, 2019; ECN, 2020).

According \nto this hierarchy, waste prevention has the highest \npriority, followed by recovery, and disposal is the least \ndesirable option. For food waste, the waste hierarchy \ncould be interpreted as shown in Figure 4.1.\n\nThis hierarchy poses an intrinsic dilemma. If capacity \nis created for bio-waste treatment, there might be \nless incentive to prevent food waste (which remains \nthe preferred option). However, not all food waste will \nbe prevented, so investments in treatment capacity \nremain necessary.\n\nThe EU and its Member States are committed to \nmeeting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3, \nadopted in 2015, which aims to halve food waste per \nperson at the retail and consumer levels by 2030\u00a0and \nto reduce food losses along the food production and \nsupply chains. To support achieving this goal, the \n\nEU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste was \nestablished in 2016, bringing together EU institutions, \nexperts from the EU Member States and relevant \nstakeholders. The platform aims to support all \nstakeholders in defining measures needed to prevent \nfood waste, sharing best practice and evaluating \nprogress made over time, and it aids the European \nCommission in identifying appropriate policies at \nEU\u00a0level (EC, 2019c).\n\nStudies on quantifying the amount of food waste use \ndifferent methodologies and definitions of food waste \n(Caldeira et al., 2019b), and this also influences the \nquality of the data presented in this report. A reliable \nbaseline for monitoring progress against this target \nhas still to be established. The WFD obliges EU Member \nStates to monitor the generation of food waste and \ntake measures to limit it. A common EU methodology \nfor measuring food waste entered into force in autumn \n2019 (EC, 2019d). It is intended to be compatible with \nthe methodology for monitoring progress towards \nSDG\u00a012.3.\n\n4 Improving food waste prevention \nin\u00a0Europe\n\nFigure 4.1  The food waste hierarchy\n\nSource:  Modified with permission from SEPA (2016).\n\nPrevent\n\nRe-use\n\nRecycle\n\nRecover other value\n\nDispose\n\n\u0387   Waste of raw materials, ingredients and \n     products arising is reduced \u2015 measured \n     in overall reduction in waste\n\n\u0387   Redistribution to people\n\n\u0387   Sent to animal feed\n\n\u0387   Waste sent to anaerobic digestion\n\n\u0387   Waste composted\n\n\u0387   Incineration of waste with energy recovery\n\n\u0387   Waste incinerated without energy recovery\n\n\u0387   Waste sent to landfill\n\n\u0387   Waste disposed of in sewerage system\n\nMost preferable option\n\nLeast preferable option\n\f\nImproving food waste prevention in Europe\n\n26 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nIn the context of waste prevention, food waste is \nrecognised as comprising both avoidable (edible) and \nunavoidable (inedible) components (Shaw et al., 2018). \nBanana peel, egg shells and meat bones are examples \nof inedible and unavoidable food waste. In contrast, \navoidable food waste is food and beverages that are \nthrown away despite still being edible, including, for \nexample, slices of bread, apples and meat. When \nprevention is considered, only the avoidable fractions \ngenerated in each sector (Figure 4.2) are considered \npreventable and monitored in accordance with \nthe common methodology laid out in Commission \nDelegated Decision (EU)\u00a02019/1597. Losses generated \nin the retail sector and by households are a particular \nconcern, especially at the household level where \nindividual behaviour and cultural differences are \ncritical\u00a0(Thyberg and Tonjes, 2016). Households are \nidentified as the sector contributing the most to food \nwaste (Figure 4.2).\n\nThe avoidable component of household food waste \nis\u00a0substantial. Estimates suggest that, across the EU, \n50-60\u00a0% of losses and waste in the food supply chain \nare generated by households and the retail sector \n(DEFRA, 2012; Stenmarck et al., 2016; Hebrok and \nBoks, 2017). The European Fusions project reported \nthat about 60\u00a0% of waste generated by consumers \n(equivalent to 32\u00a0% of all food waste) consists of \navoidable waste. Waste generation in Greece, 30\u00a0% \navoidable, and in Sweden, 35\u00a0% avoidable, fall into this \nrange (Abeliotis et al., 2015; Bernstad Saraiva Schott \nand Andersson, 2015). Estimates, however, vary: for \n\nexample, in Germany avoidable food waste has been \nestimated to account for around 65\u00a0% of the total food \nwaste from households (Braun, 2012).\n\nHowever, Schanes et al. (2018) point out that food \nwaste generation in households cannot be seen in \nisolation from other parties in the food chain \u2014 from \nthe production to the consumption stages. This is \nbecause food waste in households can arise from \naction taken further back in the food chain \u2013 through, \nfor example, incomprehensible date labels, packaging \nthat is not resealable, and sales strategies such as \nbulk\u00a0packaging and special multi-offers.\n\n4.1 Environmental and economic \nimpacts of food waste\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 88 million tonnes of \nfood \u2014 about 20\u00a0% of all food produced \u2014 is wasted \nevery year in the EU-28 (28 EU Member States) along \nthe entire food value chain, excluding food waste used \nas animal feed (Stenmarck et al., 2016). This waste is \nresponsible for a global warming potential of about \n186 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). \nTogether, the impacts of total food waste on climate, \nacidification and eutrophication contribute 15-16\u00a0% of \nthe environmental impact of the entire food value chain \n(Scherhaufer et al., 2018). In Switzerland, the 2.8 million \ntonnes of food waste generated along the whole value \nchain are estimated to be equivalent to a land area \ncorresponding to half of the agricultural land in the \ncountry (FOEN, 2020).\n\nDifferent food categories generate substantially \ndifferent environmental impacts per kilogram across \ntheir life-cycle. For example, meat has a large impact \non climate change per kilogram, while coffee, cocoa \nand some fruit, such as citrus fruit, have relatively \ngreater impacts on biodiversity. Therefore, although \nfood waste contains only about 5-12\u00a0% meat, this \nfraction contributes 25-55\u00a0% of the climate impacts of \nfood waste. In contrast, the larger amount of bread \nand starch, around 20\u00a0% of all food waste, contributes \nless than 10\u00a0% of the climate impacts (Scherhaufer et \nal., 2018; Beretta and Hellweg, 2019). Consequently, \na reduction in meat products in food waste would \nsignificantly reduce the life-cycle impacts of food \nwaste\u00a0on climate change.\n\nA comparison between studies in different countries \non savings in greenhouse gas emissions achieved \nthrough preventing food waste shows high variability, \nranging from 0.8 to 4.5\u00a0kg CO2e per kilogram of food \nwaste avoided (WRAP, 2012; Bernstad Saraiva Schott \nand Andersson, 2015; Antonopoulos et al., 2018; \nScherhaufer et al., 2018; Tonini et al., 2018; Beretta \n\nFigure 4.2  Food waste generation by sector, \nEU,\u00a02012\n\nNote:  Includes food and inedible parts associated with food. \nThe\u00a0production sector includes harvested crops leaving \nthe field/cultivation and intended for the food chain and \nmature crops not harvested, for example for economic \nreasons.

The wide \ndiscrepancy in the results of environmental impact \nassessments on food waste is due to the different \nways in which the studies are framed \u2014 whether \nthey include the full food chain or only part of it, \nthe composition of the waste and the inclusion, for \nexample, of emissions related to indirect land use. \nFurthermore, food production data sets should \nbe chosen carefully to avoid double counting and \noverestimation of the final impact (Tonini et al., 2018). \nNevertheless, a strategy to minimise food waste \nwould\u00a0result in lower greenhouse gas emissions than \nin the current situation. Most studies have pointed out \nthat, although modern alternatives for treating food \nwaste can avoid greenhouse gas emissions through \nnutrient and energy recovery, preventing food waste \nyields far greater life-cycle savings of greenhouse gas \nemissions than incineration and anaerobic digestion \n(Bernstad\u00a0Saraiva Schott and Andersson, 2015).\n\nA wide analysis of the environmental impact of food \nwaste (Scherhaufer et al., 2018) also concluded that the \nproduction phase accounts for almost three quarters \nof the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food \nwaste and that the effects of food waste treatment and \ndisposal are not the main cause of food waste-related \nimpacts.\n\nFinally, the rebound effect \u2014 when consumers spend \nthe income saved through preventing food waste on \nother goods and services \u2014 can substantially reduce \nthe environmental benefits of preventing food waste \nif\u00a0it is not addressed (Salemdeeb et al., 2017).\n\nReducing food waste in the catering sector not \nonly saves environmental impacts but also offers \nconsiderable potential for making financial savings \nfor both companies in the sector and households. \nNew policies are therefore justified not only by \n\nmeeting environmental targets but also because \nof their potentially positive effects on the economy \n(Beretta\u00a0and\u00a0Hellweg, 2019). The value of avoidable \nfood waste has been estimated in a number of \nEuropean countries and ranges between EUR\u00a03.2 and \nEUR\u00a06.1 per kilogram of waste (Table 4.1). Moreover, \nthe European Commission's Joint Research Centre has \ndeveloped a calculator to quantify the environmental \nand economic savings that can be achieved through \npreventing food waste (EC, 2020a).\n\nThe figures in Table 4.1 relate largely to the upper end \nof the food chain, that is, the catering and household \nsectors. Across the whole food supply chain, two \nthirds of the cost is associated with food wasted by \nhouseholds. The cost of food waste in the EU in 2012 \nare estimated at around EUR\u00a0143 billion, of which \naround EUR\u00a098 billion is attributed to household food \nwaste. This is due to households generating more \navoidable food waste than any other sector and the \nfact that the costs associated with a tonne of food, \nfor processing, packaging and retailing, for example, \naccumulate along the supply chain (Stenmarck \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02016).\n\nAnalysis of the economy-wide effects of reducing food \nwaste in the food industry shows that the relevant \ncosts are not only those avoided by saving food inputs \nand purchases but also those incurred by measures \nto\u00a0reduce food waste, for example additional labour \ncosts or investment in better storage facilities. \nMoreover, reducing food waste might lead to a \ndecrease in food prices, in turn encouraging increased \nuse of agricultural products (Britz et al., 2019). This \npoints to some of the key mechanisms that drive food \nwaste generation along the food value chain and to \npotential economy-wide mechanisms that can reduce \nthe theoretical cost and environmental benefits of \npreventing food waste.\n\nCountry and \nreference year\n\nAvoidable food \nwaste generated \n\n(kg/person per year)\n\nCost of food \nwaste (EUR/kg)\n\nCost of avoidable food \nwaste per year and \ncapita (EUR/person \n\nper year)\n\nReference\n\nNetherlands, 2013 47 3.2 150 van Dooren et al.

The WFD requires all EU Member States to \ndevelop specific food waste prevention programmes. \nAlthough the development of such programmes is \nstill under way, analysis of 32 national and regional \nwaste prevention programmes (EEA, 2019b) shows that \nmeasures on food waste are already included in the \nprevention programmes of 28 countries and regions \n(Wilts and Schinkel, 2018). Such measures include, \nfor example, awareness-raising and information \ncampaigns and programmes to reduce food waste. \nThese measures typically target the consumer. \nMoreover, developing guidelines on preventing food \nwaste for businesses and public institutions is also \nquite common. Voluntary agreements for businesses, \nsometimes in collaboration with public organisations \nand non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are also \npart of waste prevention programmes in a number of \ncountries, including Bulgaria and Spain.\n\nMany European countries' waste prevention \nprogrammes were adopted around 2013 and have \nbeen updated since. In the meantime, preventing food \nwaste has risen up the global and EU policy agendas. \nAs policy development is expected to be significant \nfor a high-priority waste stream, the EEA asked the \nEuropean Environment Information and Observation \n\nNetwork (Eionet) countries about the introduction \nof new prevention measures that are not specifically \nmentioned in their waste prevention programmes. \nOf the 32 countries that replied, 24 mentioned new \nmeasures on food waste (ETC/WMGE, 2019a).\n\nCountries reported a total of 91 examples of new waste \nprevention measures, among which information-based \nmeasures, 60 measures, were mentioned most \nfrequently (Figure 4.3). Other measures reported \nincluded food redistribution platforms, voluntary \nagreements, economic/financial measures, regulatory \nmeasures and monitoring food waste.\n\nFigure 4.4 presents the number of countries reporting \nnew activities to prevent food waste. Various \ninformation-based measures/activities were mentioned \nby 23 countries, while food distribution platforms have \nbeen set up in seven countries. Five countries have \nmonitoring systems in place for measuring food waste, \nwhile seven countries mentioned ongoing analyses \nand/or the development of monitoring systems, 12 \nin total. In addition, five countries, Croatia, Estonia, \nGreece, Latvia and Switzerland, mentioned having \ndedicated plans and measures in preparation for \npreventing food waste.\n\nThe present review is not a complete overview of \nall food prevention measures in the participating \ncountries, rather it provides a snapshot of some \nof\u00a0the\u00a0latest developments in Europe.\n\nFigure 4.3  Number of food waste prevention \nmeasures not included in waste \nprevention programmes reported \nby 32 EEA member and cooperating \ncountries, 2019\n\nSource:  ETC/WMGE (2019a).\n\nFood redistribution platforms Economic/financial\nmeasures\n\nRegulatory measures\n\nVoluntary \nagreements\n\nMonitoring \nfood waste\n\nInformation-based\nmeasures\n\n60 \n\n7 5\n\n7\n\n7\n\n5\n\nFigure 4.4  Number of countries reporting new \nfood waste prevention measures \nnot included in waste prevention \nprogrammes for 32 EEA member \nand\u00a0cooperating\tcountries,\t2019\n\nSource:  ETC/WMGE (2019a).\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nInformation-based\n measures\n\nFood redistribution \nplatforms\n\nVoluntary agreements\n\nMonitoring of food waste\n\nRegulatory measures\n\nEconomic/financial\nmeasures\n\nNumber of countries\n\f\nImproving food waste prevention in Europe\n\n29Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n4.2.1 Information-based measures\n\nAwareness raising is the dominant policy option. \nAlthough consumers are mentioned as the most \ntargeted group, measures targeting the catering \nindustry, mentioned by 12 countries in total, also \nstand out and include general awareness raising, \ntraining, technical support and ecolabelling. Education \non preventing food waste has also been taken up by \nprimary schools and kindergartens in seven countries. \nCooperation with industry was mentioned by five \ncountries and included sharing best practice.\n\n4.2.2 Economic/financial measures\n\nEconomic measures aim to reduce food waste through \nincentives or other market signals (Fusions, 2016). \nThey comprise fees, taxes and subsidies and are \nconsidered a powerful tool for shifting consumption \npatterns towards more sustainable food practices \n(Schanes et al., 2018).The assumption is that, if the real \ncost of using natural resources is reflected in prices, \nconsumers would be more likely to prevent food waste. \nReported economic and financial measures principally \ninclude subsidies and grants and/or tax credit schemes. \nSubsidies and grants have been directed at food banks \n(Czechia) and at research into and developing food \nwaste prevention measures. Reductions in value-added \ntax (VAT) have been implemented, for example in Italy, \non sales of leftover food.\n\n4.2.3 Regulatory measures\n\nRegulatory measures were mentioned by four \ncountries: Czechia, France, Italy, and Poland. Since \n2016, the destruction of unsold consumables has \nbeen\u00a0forbidden in France \u2014 large supermarkets \nare obliged to donate unsold but edible food to \nsocial institutions or alternatively to use it as animal \nfeed or\u00a0compost it. Redistribution requires formal \nagreements with charitable institutions. There are, \nhowever, no rules on the proportion of food to be \ndonated, which means that it is sufficient for a store \nto sign an agreement to donate 1\u00a0% of its unsold \nfood. France also obliges restaurants providing more \nthan 180 meals a day to allow customers to take \nleftover food home, providing them with a container \nif requested. In Italy, a\u00a0law was passed in 2016 \nthat facilitates and clarifies the conditions for the \nredistribution of surplus products, including food, for \ncharitable purposes. There\u00a0are no\u00a0penalties in Italy \n\u2014\u00a0companies are exempted from paying VAT and \nincome tax on their donations and passing on surplus \nfood is facilitated (Azzurro et al., 2016).\n\nIn Czechia, an amendment to the Food Act, aiming \nto reduce food waste, that came into effect in 2018 \nrequires all supermarkets larger than 400\u00a0m2 to \ndonate unsold but still consumable food to charities. \nAccording to the Czech Federation of Food Banks, \napproximately 1\u00a0900 tonnes of food were collected in \n2017, which were then redistributed to 70\u00a0000 people \nin need. Thanks to the new regulation, the amount of \nfood donated to charity increased fivefold. In Poland \na new act to counteract food waste entered into force \nin September 2019. It regulates the obligations of food \nsellers and organisations distributing food for public \nbenefit (Sejm, 2019).\n\n4.2.4 Voluntary agreements\n\nVoluntary agreements are typically a form of \ncooperation between public administrations and \nparticipating stakeholders, usually businesses. In \nthe survey, seven countries reported on voluntary \nagreements targeting food waste produced by catering \nbusiness and retailers. Ireland's Food Waste Charter, \nlaunched by the Minister for Communications, Climate \nAction and Environment in 2017, is based on voluntary \ncommitments by companies to reduce their food waste. \nFive of the six major supermarket chains in Ireland have \nsigned the charter and, as a first step, have committed \nto measuring and reporting their food waste. Austria's \nFederal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment \nand Water Management has a voluntary agreement \n(Vereinbarung 2017-2030) that involves both retailers \nand food producers in halving food waste by 2030. \nThe\u00a0document includes lists of measures by means of \nwhich the partners can contribute to achieving the goal.\n\n4.2.5 Targets\n\nSix countries specifically mentioned having set targets \nfor reducing food waste, which are generally in line with \nthe target of SDG\u00a012.3 of halving retail and consumer \nfood waste per person by 2030. France, however, has \na\u00a0National Pact Against Food Waste that aims to reduce \nfood waste by 50\u00a0% as soon as 2025.\n\n4.2.6 Food redistribution platforms\n\nFood redistribution and donation platforms have \nrecently been set up in several European countries, \nlargely to complement regulations and voluntary \nagreements involving retailers and catering companies \nin donating leftover and second-class food and food \nproducts. The impact of such measures on food waste \ngeneration is direct and can be easily monitored. \n\f\nImproving food waste prevention in Europe\n\n30 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nExperience shows, however, that to be effective \ndistribution platforms need to be complemented \nwith proper support, which traditionally has been \nprovided on a non-profit and/or voluntary basis \n(e.g.\u00a0Gram-Hanssen et al., 2016). Insufficient logistical \nresources and storage can easily lead to a situation \nin which only a minor part of the redistributed food \nactually reaches its proper destination. In\u00a0a\u00a0pilot \nproject, the Federation of Polish Food Banks started \nusing cooling devices and cooled transport, allowing \nmore fresh food to be donated (Eionet,\u00a02019). \nNevertheless, relying on donations as the main \nchannel\u00a0for reducing food waste implies that, \nif\u00a0charities' need for donated food declines, the \nproblem of excess food will return, as its underlying \ncauses have not been adequately tackled.\n\n4.2.7 Measuring the effectiveness of food waste \nprevention policies\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of waste prevention \nactivities or policies has been identified as a \nfundamental challenge, and many countries measure \nthe effects of waste prevention activities through proxy \nindicators such as number of signatories to voluntary \nagreements or similar. The question is particularly \nrelevant in the case of information-based measures, \nwhich make up about 70\u00a0% of the activities listed in \ncountries' waste prevention programmes (Wilts and \nSchinkel, 2018). It is often very difficult to measure the \neffects of such activities because of the long time lags \nand very indirect impacts on specific consumption \nor production patterns; however, frameworks for \nassessing food waste prevention measures have \nbeen\u00a0developed (Caldeira et al., 2019a).\n\nGiven its complex nature, the evidence on drivers \nof food wastage and barriers to reducing it remains \nscattered. This is especially true when it comes \nto food waste generated in households. Despite \na\u00a0growing number of studies, little is known about \nthe determinants of consumer food waste and the \nunderlying factors that drive or impede food waste \nbehaviour and practices. Schanes et al. (2018) point \nout that, to be effective, information initiatives have \nto address the specific knowledge gaps that drive \nwasteful practices. Education on the meaning of \ndate labelling combined with efforts to increase the \nacceptability of imperfect food \u2014 food that is less \nfresh,\u00a0less aesthetically attractive or nearing its expiry \ndate \u2014\u00a0have been a key component in countering \nand\u00a0avoiding confusion among householders.\n\nUntil now, data on food waste generation have usually \nbeen based on ad hoc studies. This will change, as \nall EU Member States will report data on food waste \ngeneration from 2022 onwards, in line with the recently \nadopted harmonised monitoring methodology. In the \nfuture, this will enable the comparison of the potential \nimpact of different policy mixes for preventing food \nwaste adopted in European countries. Such new \ndata will enable the effectiveness of policies to be \nanalysed, complementing the knowledge available \ntoday, which tends to link specific amounts of \nwaste avoided to specific activities without making \na solid connection to national/regional policies. The \navailability of food waste data at the national level \nwill help to assess the\u00a0effectiveness of prevention \ninitiatives conducted\u00a0at\u00a0national level; nevertheless, \nthere is a wealth of initiatives conducted at smaller \nscales (e.g.\u00a0city/neighbourhood level), which cannot \nbe precisely monitored with national-level tools. \nRobust monitoring systems should be put in place to \nassess the effectiveness and efficiency of such local \nactions. This will enable us to identify best practices \nand promote the implementation of certain types of \ninitiatives (Caldeira et al., 2019a).\n\n4.3 Good practice\n\nWaste prevention includes a variety of measures that \ncan be employed at national, regional and company \nlevels.\n\nThe following sections discuss examples of good \npractice implemented in some European countries.\n\n4.3.1 Food donation policy in Czechia\n\nCzechia is an example of a country that has recently \namended its legislation to facilitate the prevention \nof food waste and to promote food redistribution. \nIn 2014, the 15\u00a0% VAT rate applied to donated food \nwas abolished and, in 2018, Czechia introduced an \nobligation on stores of more than 400\u00a0m2 to donate \nunsold but still consumable food to charitable \norganisations. As the new regulation forced many \nstores to start donating, the volumes of redistributed \nfood increased dramatically. The distribution takes \nplace through food banks, not-for-profit organisations \nthat handle donations on a large scale and distribute \nthem further to NGOs. In total, there are 15 food banks \nin Czechia serving in Prague alone through around \n120\u00a0NGOs. The increasing volume has been challenging \n\f\nImproving food waste prevention in Europe\n\n31Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nfor the food banks, especially the redistribution of \nperishable foods such as vegetables, milk and meat. \nTo handle this, some food banks have widened their \nactivities, establishing kitchens in which meals can be \nprepared from donated products. This increases the \nwindow of time that food banks have to find clients and \nbroadens their clientele to include meal distributors. \nThe average total food waste generated in Czechia is \nalmost half that of the EU (Brno Daily, 2018).\n\n4.3.2 Ecolabels\n\nCertification and labelling schemes operating within \nthe food supply chain are important policymaking \nopportunities. A label can motivate a company to \nstart\u00a0measuring and implementing waste reduction \npolicies/processes, and the related certification can \nform the basis for a good public procurement policy \nfor\u00a0food waste.\n\nAccording to the results of the survey, ecolabelling \nschemes are in use or planned in at least Austria, \nDenmark and Finland. The target group consists \nof mainly catering companies and retailers. New \nlabels and existing schemes can be used. Finland, \nfor example, is planning to use the criteria of the \nestablished Nordic Swan Ecolabel or the EU Ecolabel \nto\u00a0steer supermarkets and the hospitality sector \ntowards action consistent with the circular economy. \nThe aim is to reduce waste volumes and to cut \ndown on the amount of unsorted waste destined \nfor incineration. Supermarkets will, moreover, be \nrequired\u00a0to measure their food losses.\n\nThe Danish DAKA ReFood recycler has launched \nthe ReFood Label in collaboration with the Danish \nAgriculture and Food Council and the consumer \n\nmovement Stop Wasting Food. The label functions \nas a\u00a0green seal of approval for organisations and \ncompanies that are making an active effort to reduce \nfood waste and increase recycling. In 2015, more than \n300 restaurants in Denmark were members of the \nReFood Label.\n\n4.3.3 Best before, but ...\n\nDate labelling on food packaging is a key food policy \ninstrument, positioned between production, retailing \nand consumption. A lack of knowledge about what date \nlabels mean and confusion over the difference between \nthe expiry date and the date of minimum durability, or \n'best before date' (Regulation 1169/2001/EU) have been \nidentified as major contributors to avoidable consumer \nfood waste (Ceuppens et al., 2016; Priefer et al., 2016). \nThe European Commission estimated in 2018 that up to \n10\u00a0% of the 88 million tonnes of food waste generated \nannually in the EU is linked to date labelling (EC, 2018b). \nThere is great potential for reducing food waste by \noptimising labelling of pre-packed food products to \nprevent confusion among consumers over expiry dates. \nMore specifically, food waste could be reduced by \nremoving sell by dates or date labels completely from \nsome product groups and extending the list of food \nproducts exempted from indicating best before dates \n(Schanes et al., 2018).\n\nIn 2018, two major dairy companies and an egg \nproducer in Norway introduced packages stamped with \n'best before, but not bad after' as a way to combat food \nwaste. This decision was partly based on the fact that \nnearly one third of Norwegians have thrown away milk \non the expiry date without first checking whether it was \nstill good.\n\f\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities32\n\nQuality management and creating a\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\nTo close the bio-waste circle, compost and digestate \nproduced from bio-waste should be of good quality \nto\u00a0enable their use as a soil improver or fertiliser. \nTo\u00a0create a market for compost and digestate, \nmanaging the quality of the process and the end \nproducts is very important, as it is an integral part \nof\u00a0a\u00a0bio-waste management system. It aims to build \ntrust in the products by guaranteeing the quality \nof\u00a0the\u00a0end products.\n\nCompost has two main uses as a product: as a soil \nimprover/organic fertiliser and as a component in \ngrowing media. The application of compost in or on soil \nusually improves the physical, biological and chemical \nproperties of soil. Repeated application of compost \nleads to an increase in soil organic matter, it often \nhelps to reduce erosion, increases the water retention \ncapacity and pH buffer capacity, and improves the \nphysical structure of soil (aggregate stability, density, \npore size). Compost may also improve the biological \nactivity of soil. Compost also contains different \nnutrients, micronutrients and has a neutralising value \nfor soil. The phosphate and potassium demand of \nagricultural soils can, in many cases, largely be covered \nby adequate compost application, while the supply of \nplant-available nitrogen by compost needs repeated \napplications over a longer period of time to achieve \na\u00a0measurable effect (Saveyn and Eder, 2014).\n\n5.1 Production of compost and \ndigestate\n\n5.1.1 Compost\n\nIn European countries with separate bio-waste \ncollection, composting delivers more than 11.8 \nmillion tonnes of compost. Austria, the Belgian region \nof Flanders, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, \nwhich pioneered bio-waste recycling in the 1990s, \nremain frontrunners in the (per person) generation of \ncompost from bio-waste today, but others have caught \nup (Figure 5.1). The recycling targets for municipal \nwaste in the Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008, \n2018b) and the Landfill Directive's (EU, 1999, 2018a) \ntarget to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10\u00a0% of the \nmunicipal waste generated by 2035 will encourage \n\ncomposting and anaerobic digestion of bio-waste. \nThis can be seen, for example, in Slovenia, which has \nbecome a frontrunner in collecting and treating biowaste, since its decree on biodegradable kitchen and \ngarden waste management was introduced, and in \nLithuania, where a ban on landfilling bio-waste has \nled to the establishment of many small-scale garden \nwaste processing plants (ECN, 2019). In these countries \ncompost production exceeds 30\u00a0kg per person per year.\n\n5.1.2 Digestate\n\nHistorically, anaerobic digestion of bio-waste often \nstarted with the co-digestion of manure and/or sewage \nsludge in, for example, Denmark, Flanders and Italy. \nHowever, renewable energy policies and subsidies \nfor generating electricity, gas and heat from biomass \nimproved the economic conditions for anaerobic \ndigestion of bio-waste or food waste in Austria, \nFlanders, Germany, Slovenia and the United Kingdom \nand for co-digestion of bio-waste, manure and other \nfeedstock, which has become common in, among \nothers, Denmark, Flanders and Germany.

In\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands \nand Italy, for example, the digestate from municipal \nbio-waste is composted and only the final amounts of \ncompost produced are recorded (ECN,\u00a02019).\n\nAnaerobic (co-)digestion of bio-waste delivers around \n4.14 million tonnes of digestate in Europe, and there \nare big differences in the amounts countries produce \nper person (Figure 5.1).\n\n5.1.3 Nutrient recycling and soil improvers\n\nIt is estimated that, through the production of digestate \nand compost from 47.5 million tonnes of separately \ncollected bio-waste, over 129\u00a0000 tonnes of nitrogen, \n42\u00a0000 tonnes of phosphate and 3.5 million tonnes \nof organic carbon were recycled in the 18 European \n\n5 Quality management and creating \na\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\f\nQuality management and creating a\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\n33Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\ncountries/regions for which data were available, as \nshown in Figure 5.1 (ECN, 2019). This estimate is based \non the following assumptions on the nutrient content \nin\u00a0fresh compost/digestate (WRAP (2016):\n\n\u2022 Nitrogen: 9.25\u00a0kg per tonne compost (mean of \ngarden waste and garden/food waste compost), \n5\u00a0kg\u00a0per tonne food waste digestate.\n\n\u2022 Phosphate (P2O5): 3.4\u00a0kg per tonne compost, \n0.5\u00a0kg\u00a0per tonne food waste digestate.\n\nThe European Compost Network calculated that the \namount of nitrogen in the digestate and compost \nproduced is equivalent to 1.5\u00a0% of the total inorganic \nnitrogen and 4.3\u00a0% of inorganic phosphate consumed \nby the 18 European countries shown in Figure 5.1 \n\n(ECN, 2019). Applying the same assumptions on \nnutrient content to the around 50 million tonnes of \nmunicipal bio-waste that is currently collected within \nmixed municipal waste in the EU-28 (28 EU Member \nStates) suggests that a potential 134\u00a0000 tonnes of \nnitrogen and 44\u00a0000 tonnes of phosphate is currently \nwasted.\n\nThe market for high-quality compost from bio-waste \ncould be further developed, for example for organic \nfarming where the use of mineral fertilisers is not \nallowed (Raussen et al., 2019). Long-term experiments \non agricultural management practices across Europe \nand China have shown that applying compost \nincreases soil organic matter levels, the number \nof earthworms, crop yield and other parameters \n(Bai\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018).\n\nSource:  EEA, based on theoretical estimated amounts of compost and digestate generated as documented in country fact sheets in ECN (2019).\n\nFigure 5.1  Production of compost and digestate from bio-waste by country, 2016\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nPortugal\n\nPoland\n\nEstonia\n\nHungary\n\nSweden\n\nNorway\n\nFinland\n\nIreland\n\nFrance\n\nSlovenia\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nDenmark\n\nGermany\n\nItaly\n\nLithuania\n\nAustria\n\nFlanders \n(Belgium)\n\nNetherlands\n\nKg digestate/person Kg compost/person\n\f\nQuality management and creating a\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\n34 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n5.2 Market for compost and composted \ndigestate\n\nCompost is mostly used as an organic fertiliser and soil \nimprover (ECN, 2019). Figure 5.2 shows the different \nmarket sectors for compost from municipal bio-waste \nfor those countries that have quantified information: \nagriculture and horticulture seem to be the main \nmarkets, and this is also assumed to be the case in \ncountries that do not have quantified market data.\n\nAround 50\u00a0% of the compost goes to agriculture and \nhorticulture in Europe; in Switzerland more than 90\u00a0% \nis used in agriculture. Around 30\u00a0% of the compost, \noften mixed with other components, is used as a soil \nimprover in parks, private gardens and for landscaping \nin Flanders, Germany and Italy (Figure 5.2).\n\nAcross Europe there is also growing awareness of \nthe negative effects of peat extraction and its use \nin horticultural growing media. High-quality mature \ncompost can be used at a share of 20-40\u00a0% in growing \nmedia mixes. In Flanders, Germany, Ireland and the \nNetherlands (Figure 5.2) this is actually a valuable \nmarket opportunity for compost manufacturers. \nNorway has recently set a national target to phase \nout the use of peat in growing media for amateur \nusers by 2025 and in professional horticulture \nby\u00a02030\u00a0(ECN,\u00a02019).\n\nAgriculture is the largest receiving sector for digestate, \nas it is considered to be a useful organic fertiliser \nbecause the nutrients are present in a form that is \nreadily available for uptake by plants.\n\n5.2.1 Impact of compost on soil and the environment\n\nOrganic matter is a key component of soil, controlling \nmany vital functions. It has been estimated that 45\u00a0% \nof European soils have a very low organic matter \ncontent. This is particularly the case in the soils of \nmany southern European countries, but also in \nparts of Belgium, France, Germany, Norway and the \nUnited Kingdom (JRC, 2012). Repeated applications \nof good-quality compost can improve the soil's \nability to retain water and nutrients and to store \ncarbon, as well as raising its fertility. In some regions, \ncompost is competing with other organic fertilisers \nsuch as manure\u00a0or digestate (e.g. in Belgium and the \nNetherlands), leading to an oversupply of organic \nfertilisers.\n\nUsing good-quality compost to replace inorganic \nN\u00a0P\u00a0K fertiliser, as well as peat in growing media, \nhas environmental benefits because the production \nof mineral fertilisers and the harvesting of peat are \navoided. Finally, compost is of value for growing \nmedia\u00a0because of its microbial diversity.\n\nSources:  Data for France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands from ETC/WMGE (2019a), for the European average from ECN (2019), for Germany \nfrom\u00a0BGK\u00a0(2018), for Flanders from VLACO (2019), and for Switzerland from Fuchs (2016).\n\nFigure 5.2  Market for compost from bio-waste in selected countries/regions, 2018\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n%\n\nAgriculture and horticulture Landscaping and green areas               Growing media Export Other\n\nEuro\npean ave\n\nra\nge\n\nFla\nnders\n\n(B\nelgi\n\num)\nFra\n\nnce\n\nGerm\nany\n\nIre\nland\n\nIta\nly\n\nNeth\nerla\n\nnds\n\nSw\nitz\n\nerla\nnd\n\f\nQuality management and creating a\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\n35Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n5.2.2 Impact of the EU Fertilising Products Regulation\n\nThe EU Fertilising Products Regulation (EU, 2019b) is \nintended to create a policy framework to encourage the \nuse of organic fertilisers and soil improvers, thereby \ndecreasing the EU's dependency on imports of mineral \nfertilisers and contributing to a circular economy \nfor nutrients. By fulfilling the requirements of the \nregulation, compost and digestate-based fertilising \nproducts (organic fertiliser, soil improver and growing \nmedia) can be placed on the European market. National \nrules for fertilisers and soil improvers may continue to \nexist and, where there is bilateral recognition of these \nrules, Member States may still export materials that \ncomply with national product requirements.\n\nThe regulation builds upon three pillars:\n\n1. Product function categories, for example organic \nsoil improvers and growing media, with specified \nstandards. These materials are made up of one \nor\u00a0a\u00a0combination of component material categories.\n\n2. Component material categories, for example \ncompost and digestate.\n\n3. Modules for the conformity assessment: for \ncompost and digestate-based fertilising products, \nthe conformity procedure envisages external \ncontrol by a notified conformity assessment body \nauditing the production process and the product \nquality.\n\nWorking groups still have to decide on many questions \nthat arise from the regulation. Its rules will affect \ncompanies in EU Member States that want to export \ncompost or soil improvers, fertilisers and growing \nmedia based on compost or dried digestate to other \nEU Member States. From 16\u00a0July 2020 onwards, \nexporting producers need certification (CE marking) of \ntheir products. Some criteria for this certification are \nvery clear. For example, bio-waste that is not collected \nseparately, sewage sludge and industrial sludge are not \nallowed as input materials.\n\nIn some countries/regions, including Flanders \n(Belgium), existing national standards are more \nstringent than the EU soil improver standards for \ncompost based on bio-waste and garden waste. \nThe conformity assessment requires a good quality \nmanagement and assurance system covering the \nproduction and the products, as already implemented \nin 11 European countries/regions (Section 5.4). Finally, \ncompost and digestate are exempt from registration \nunder the EU Regulation on registration, evaluation, \nauthorisation and restriction of chemicals (EU, 2006).\n\n5.3 Quality of compost and digestate\n\nOf the countries surveyed, 24 have national standards \nfor compost quality, which are either set in legislation, \nstandalone standards or under development \n(Table\u00a05.1).\n\nThe quality standards for heavy metals and impurities \nand the limits on application doses to soil vary between \ncountries/regions, as they are mostly dependent \non the specific situation, for example the soil \nstructure, background concentrations of pollutants, \nagricultural\u00a0practices, and lack or presence of other \nsoil\u00a0improvers/fertilisers (Saveyn and Eder, 2014).\n\nCompost quality is best in countries with separate \ncollection of municipal bio-waste, where the type \nand\u00a0quality of the input material is regulated. \nCountries/regions where sewage sludge is not \nallowed\u00a0to be co-treated with bio-waste and a risk \nassessment is obligatory for all input materials \nface few\u00a0problems in achieving the product quality \nstandards (Saveyn and Eder, 2014).\n\nPollution with plastics is an important aspect when \nputting compost on the market, and several countries \nmention plastics as a key contaminant to be addressed \n(Eionet, 2019). The EU Fertilising Products Regulation \nallows up to 2.5\u00a0g plastics per kilogram compost \n(dry matter); however, several countries apply more \nstringent limits. The quality standards for impurities, \nincluding plastics, have recently been strengthened \nin the quality assurance systems in Flanders and \nGermany, and these standards are expressed in terms \nof not only weight but also surface area. Analyses \nof quality-assured compost in Germany revealed, \non average, 0.3\u00a0g plastics per kilogram compost (dry \nmatter), but with considerable variation (Kehres, 2018).\n\nPolicies that aim to increase the share of bio-waste \ncaptured from municipal waste might increase the risk \nof contamination (van der Zee and Molenveld, 2020), \nrequiring additional measures to reduce contamination \nof bio-waste with plastics during collection. Avoiding \ncontamination with plastics at source is the most \neffective and efficient approach, as removing plastic \ncontamination from bio-waste during treatment is \nboth expensive and limited in its effect (Kehres, 2017). \nOverall, more attention needs to be given to avoiding \ncontamination of bio-waste and compost with plastics.\n\nSome countries/regions, including Denmark, Flanders, \nGermany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, have \ndeveloped quality standards for digestate as well. \nIn\u00a0many cases digestate may be applied directly onto \nagricultural land.\n\f\nQuality management and creating a\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\n36 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n5.4 Quality management system\n\nAn efficient quality management system enables the \nproduction of high-quality compost, ensures reliability \nand trust, and facilitates the creation of a compost \nmarket. Developing and controlling product quality \nstandards for compost and digestate is just one step. \nA\u00a0quality management system, however, includes \nseveral steps: composting and anaerobic digestion \nplants are audited throughout the entire production \nchain, from input to output and application of the \nproducts. Compost and digestate samples are taken \non a regular basis, and an automatic control system, \nlaid down in a quality manual, is part of the quality \nmanagement system in each treatment plant. If there \nis a problem in an individual plant, an action plan is \ndeveloped to find the external source of pollution and \ntake measures to improve quality.\n\nCurrently, 11 countries have developed and \nimplemented compost quality management and \nassurance schemes (Table 5.1), which are mainly based \non the European Compost Network's quality assurance \nscheme (Figure 5.3). In the Netherlands, compost \nis certified under a voluntary industry initiative that \ncovers process requirements, time and temperature, \nand contaminant limit values.\n\nApplying a proper quality management system \nand producing high-quality compost and digestate \nopens the door to higher added value markets such \n\nas growing media, as can be seen, for example, in \nFlanders, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands \n(Figure\u00a05.2).\n\nQuality management systems can also help avoid \ninstances of misapplication of low-quality compost or \ndigestate, which can potentially put a country's whole \nbio-waste management system at risk. An EU-wide \nrequirement to introduce quality management systems \nfor the whole bio-waste management system might \ntherefore help support both optimal use of bio-waste as \na resource and a high level of environmental protection.\n\nTable 5.1 gives an overview of the status of separate \ncollection of municipal bio-waste, national standards \nfor the quality of compost and the quality management \nsystem in each country. There are differences in \nthe maturity of these systems. Eleven countries \nalready report that they have implemented a quality \nmanagement system, the final step following the \nnational rollout of separate collections of bio-waste \nand embedding standards for the quality of compost in \nnational legislation.\n\nIn Flanders (Belgium), Germany, Sweden and the United \nKingdom quality management systems exist for the \nproduction of digestate and digestate-based products \nderived from operating bio-waste co-digested with \nenergy crops or manure. These quality systems are \nalso based on the European Compost Network's quality \nassurance scheme (Figure 5.3).\n\nSource:  ECN (2018b).\n\nFigure 5.3  The essential elements of the European Compost Network's quality management and \nassurance scheme\n\nSuitable input material\n\nProduct use\n\nProduct quality \n\nOperation quality\n\nPositive-list\n\nApplication\nrecommendation\n\nProduct control\n\nCheck-list\n\nCertified by ECN and proved by \nconformity assessed by National \nQuality Assurance Organisation\n\nECN-QAS Quality Label \n\f\nQuality management and creating a\u00a0market for compost and digestate\n\n37Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n*Under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99.\n\nNote:  +++ a mature system embedded in national legislation; ++ part way between starting out and reaching maturity;\u00a0+\u00a0 just starting out \nor on a voluntary basis or developing local/regional or national standards; - not started.\n\nSources:  ECN (2018a, 2019).

Bio-waste is a potential source of chemicals, \nproducts and energy. Innovation plays a key part in \nvalorising bio-waste. Currently, composting is the most \ncommon method of municipal bio-waste treatment \nin Europe, and anaerobic digestion is the most \nadvanced treatment method that is commonly used. \nIn addition to these treatment methods, however, \nthere are various emerging technologies aimed at \nvalorising bio-waste as a source of products or energy. \nCurrently, most of the more advanced technologies \nare more suitable for and applied to bio-waste from \nfood processing and agriculture, as these bio-waste \nstreams are better defined and cleaner. This chapter \nreviews potential alternative technologies for bio-waste \nmanagement in Europe.\n\n6.1 Creating new materials and \nproducts from bio-waste\n\nIn recent years, various new concepts for creating \nnew materials and products from biomass, including \nbio-waste, have received significant attention. \nProcessing facilities in which biomass is converted \ninto valuable products such as chemicals, biofuels, \nfood and feed ingredients, biomaterials or fibres are \ncalled biorefineries (Fava et al., 2015; Vea et al., 2018; \nParisi et al., 2018). Integrated biorefineries combine \nthe production of bio-based products and energy \nfrom biomass. Biorefineries use different types of \norganic feedstocks, including bio-waste. There are \n803\u00a0biorefineries in Europe, 136 of which report \ntaking\u00a0in waste streams (Parisi et al., 2018).\n\nThe most common bio-waste valorisation processes \nare the production of fuels, ethanol, methane and \nhydrogen and the extraction of organic acids from \nvolatile fatty acids (VFAs) (Matsakas et al., 2017; \nVea\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018). Converting bio-waste from municipal \nsources into products in a biorefinery is challenging \nbecause of the mixed nature and complex composition \nof this type of waste. Existing full-scale waste-based \nbiorefineries mainly use homogeneous waste streams \nfrom agriculture and food processing as feedstock. \nBiorefineries using the organic fraction of municipal \n\n6 Innovation and future developments\n\nwaste as feedstock are a promising opportunity for \na\u00a0future circular bioeconomy and they would help \nus to move up the waste hierarchy (Vea et al., 2018). \nFurther research and development are needed to move \nto large-scale commercial biorefineries that are both \nenvironmentally and economically sustainable.\n\n6.1.1 Ethanol fermentation\n\nEthanol is commonly produced by fermenting biological \nmaterial and it is considered one of the most important \nliquid biofuels (Matsakas et al., 2017). Ethanol can be \nblended with petrol to produce fuels such as E5 and \nE10 (Matsakas et al., 2017; Bhatia et al., 2018). In the \nethanol fermentation processes, the carbohydrate \nfraction of municipal waste, including glucose, fructose, \nstarch and\u00a0cellulose, is converted into ethanol (Matsakas \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). Currently, bioethanol is often produced \nfrom maize- or sugarcane-derived feedstocks. Producing \nbioethanol from edible feedstock has raised concerns \nbecause of its competition with food and feed. \nNon-edible feedstock, also known as second-generation \nfeedstock, derived from waste streams, has been \nsuggested as a sustainable alternative for bioethanol \nproduction (Lohri et al., 2017). The feasibility of this \nconcept has been proven in Finland (Box 6.1).\n\n6.1.2 Production of volatile fatty acids\n\nVFAs are short-chain fatty acids that are used in various \napplications, for example in the production of biofuels \nor bio-based plastics and in the biological removal of \nnutrients from waste water. At present, VFAs are mainly \nderived from fossil fuels through chemical synthesis, \nbut in recent years there has been growing interest in \nbio-based VFA production from such waste streams as \nfood waste, the organic fraction of municipal waste and \nindustrial waste water (Lee et al., 2014; Strazzera et al., \n2018). Food waste contains high levels of organic matter, \nhigh nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations and \nnutrients for the metabolic pathway of microorganisms, \nmaking food waste an optimal substrate for VFA \nproduction (Strazzera et al., 2018). VFAs are produced as \nan intermediate product of anaerobic digestion of such \nwaste streams as food waste or waste-activated sludge \n\f\nInnovation and future developments\n\n39Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n(Atasoy et al., 2018). Compared with methane, VFAs have \nmany possibilities for high value, non-energy-related \nend uses. However, producing VFAs through anaerobic \ndigestion is still in the upscaling phase and its full-scale \nproduction has been tested with only a narrow spectrum \nof types of biomass, for example sewage sludge \n(Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018). Further developments are required to \nenable sustainable and economically feasible production \nand recovery of VFAs from bio-waste at market scale. \nThe most important challenges are optimising the \noperational parameters for VFA production and the \ncost-effective separation of VFAs from digestate \n(Atasoy\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018; Tampio et al., 2019).\n\n6.1.3 Production of biohydrogen\n\nBio-waste can also be used to produce hydrogen \n(H2), valuable as a source of clean energy, for which \ndemand has increased considerably in recent years. \nConventional methods for the production of H2 are \nexpensive because of the high energy requirements. \nThere are also biological methods for producing \nH2, in which bio-waste can be used as feedstock. \nDark fermentation and photo-fermentation are \nbiological processes that have been widely studied \nfor\u00a0H2\u00a0production (Sabarathinam et al., 2016; \nSch\u00fcch et al., 2019). There are still major barriers for \nindustrial-scale H2 fermentation technologies, such \nas low substrate conversion efficiency and low yield \n(Sabarathinam et al., 2016). Another option is H2 \nproduction from waste-derived VFAs (Lee et al., 2014).\n\n6.1.4 Nutrient recovery from bio-waste\n\nRecovery of nutrients from bio-waste is increasingly \nrelevant, and recovery of phosphorus is increasingly \nrecognised because of concerns over the depletion \nof this non-renewable resource. The European \n\nCommission has included phosphate rock on its list \nof critical raw materials (EC et al., 2017). Phosphate \nrock is the original source of phosphorus used in \nfertilisers and industrial applications. Secondary \nsources of phosphorus are unevenly distributed, \nand therefore demand from agriculture and the \namounts of\u00a0secondary nutrients available might \nnot match in each region. When used in fertilisers, \nphosphorus ultimately ends up in solid bio-wastes, \nsuch as food waste, animal manures, sewage sludges \nand crop biomass, and therefore efficient recovery \nof phosphorus from bio-waste could not only reduce \ndependency on non-renewable resources but also \nreduce the run-off of phosphorus and eutrophication \nof water (Huang et al., 2017).\n\nThere are two strategies for its recovery from solid \nbio-wastes: (1) direct application of phosphorus-rich \nproducts as fertilisers; and (2) its recovery as pure \ncompounds (Huang et al., 2017). Anaerobic digestion \nof bio-waste produces digestate that contains all the \nnutrients from the food waste feedstock and can \nbe used as an agricultural fertiliser. There might be \nobstacles related to the direct application of digestate \nand therefore it sometimes needs further processing \nto concentrate and recover the nutrients as highquality end products. A range of technologies has been \ndeveloped that can be applied to digestate processing. \nThe best available ones for nutrient recovery are \nstruvite precipitation and crystallisation, ammonia \nstripping and absorption, and acidic air scrubbing; \nthey have already been implemented at full-scale and \nhave the ability to produce marketable end products. \nHowever, these technologies require further technical \ndevelopment to minimise operational costs and \nimprove the quality and predictability of the fertilisers \nproduced. Vibrating membrane filtration is also a \npotential nutrient recovery technology, but its technical \nand economic performance at full-scale has yet to be \ndemonstrated (Vaneeckhaute et al., 2017).\n\n \nBox 6.1  St1's Etanolix and Bionolix processes\n\nThe Finnish energy company St1 has developed a process called Etanolix that uses locally generated waste and process \nresidues. During the multi-phase process, the feedstock is hydrolysed and fermented into alcohol that is then recovered \nand\u00a0dehydrated to fuel grade. The end product is fuel-grade ethanol, which is ready for use in high-blend ethanol fuels \nor\u00a0as\u00a0the bio-component in low blends. The process also generates stillage that can be used as high-protein animal feed \nor\u00a0as a feedstock in biogas plants for producing renewable electricity and heat.\n\nSt1's Etanolix concept refines waste and residues rich in starch and sugar, for example bio-waste from bakeries, breweries \nand beverage production as well as retail waste including surplus bread and sorted bio-waste. The annual production \ncapacity varies between 1 and 9 million litres. St1 has also developed the Bionolix biorefining concept that produces ethanol \nfrom municipal and commercial bio-waste. The Bionolix process uses packaged and unpackaged municipal and retail food \nwaste as feedstock to produce ethanol that can be used in various applications. The Bionolix technology has been tested and \nnow operates in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland. The plant is integrated with a biogas plant and has an annual production capacity of \n1 million litres of advanced ethanol (St1, 2018).\n\f\nInnovation and future developments\n\n40 Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\n6.2 Innovation related to energy \nrecovery from bio-waste\n\nIn addition to biogas production through anaerobic \ndigestion, ethanol fermentation and incineration, there \nare other technologies that can be used to convert \nbio-waste to energy. These methods include pyrolysis, \ngasification and hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC).\n\nPyrolysis is the thermochemical process in which \nbiomass is decomposed at high temperature in \nthe absence of oxygen, producing solid, liquid and \ngaseous products (Lohri et al., 2017). Pyrolysis allows \nthe transformation of low-energy-density materials \ninto high-energy-density biofuels and the recovery of \nhigher value chemicals. One of its advantages is that \nmany types of raw material can be used, including \nindustrial and domestic residues, but making pyrolysis \neconomically viable remains challenging. Work is \nneeded to take the latest developments into a pilot \nphase and then to an industrial scale (Czajczy\u0144ska \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02017).\n\nGasification is a thermal treatment method that \nconverts organic material into syngas\u00a0(1) at high \ntemperature. The gas produced can be used as a fuel \nor for producing chemicals. Gasification is considered \na promising technology for bio-waste treatment \nbecause it produces minimal emissions and is a \nflexible technology that can be adapted to treat various \nmaterials (Watson et al., 2018). In addition, there is the \npossibility of coupling the operating conditions and \nfeatures of a specific reactor to obtain a syngas suitable \nfor different applications (Pham et al., 2015). Currently, \nlarge-scale commercial implementation of gasification \nis limited to municipal waste and agricultural residues. \nThe economics of bio-waste gasification depend on the \ngate fees charged by gasification plants for accepting \nbio-waste, the capacity to generate electricity and the \nefficiency of the gasifier (Watson et al., 2018).\n\nHTC is a thermochemical process involving pressurised \nwater at relatively low temperatures (between \n180\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0and 250\u00a0\u00b0C) at or above saturated pressure \nthat converts bio-waste into hydrochar, which can \nbe used as a solid fuel or soil improver or be further \nprocessed into activated carbon (Heidenreich \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). The end product of the process is a \nsterile and energy-rich resource that can be easily \nstored and transported. HTC\u00a0is especially applicable \nto bio-waste with a high water content (Li et al., \n\n2013; Pham et al., 2015; Bhatia\u00a0et al., 2018). It has \nadvantages over other energy\u00a0conversion technologies, \nincluding greater reductions in waste volume and \na short reaction time of only a\u00a0few hours (Li et al., \n2013; Pham\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015). Another benefit associated \nwith HTC is the potential for the recovery of nutrients \nfrom the liquids (Li\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013). HTC is an attractive \noption for bio-waste\u00a0management, but there are still \nsome challenges that have to be resolved as well as \nthe need for a techno-economic analysis to study \nthe feasibility of using HTC in a\u00a0large-scale operation \n(Pham\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).\n\n6.3 Animal feed production\n\nCertain types of food waste, especially from the food \nindustry, can be turned into animal feed; however, \nEU food safety legislation creates a number of \nbarriers. Broeze and Luyckx (2019) found that there \nare opportunities for safe pathways to increase the \nvalorising of food waste into animal feed that still meet \nthe intended food safety standards. One technology \nalready available and in principle suitable for municipal \nbio-waste is using the waste to produce insect protein \nusing black soldier fly larvae, a simple method \npotentially suitable for decentralised conditions in \ndefined environments (Dortmans et al., 2017; Lohri \net al., 2017; Gold et al., 2018). Black soldier fly larvae \nconsume the bio-waste converting it into larval biomass \nand a compost-like residue. The larval biomass \ncontains 32\u201358\u00a0% proteins and 15\u201339\u00a0% lipids and can \nbe used as a raw material for animal feed production \n(Gold\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018). The potential options for applying \nsuch approaches were explored with stakeholders in \nthe Flemish Strategic Platform for Insects (Eionet,\u00a02019). \nAlthough this technology is currently not allowed \naccording to EU food safety regulations, this might \nchange in the coming years (Lohri et al., 2017).\n\n6.4 Opportunities and challenges for \ninnovations\n\nBio-waste can be a valuable resource for recycling and \nenergy generation. Currently there is much ongoing \nresearch looking at valorising bio-waste as bio-products \nand biofuels, although there are still many challenges \nthat need to be tackled. Emerging technologies in \nbio-waste management and their main opportunities \nand challenges are listed in Table 6.1. Apart from the \n\n(1) A gas mixture consisting primarily of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and often some carbon dioxide.\n\f\nInnovation and future developments\n\n41Bio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\ntechnological aspects, economic, environmental and \nsocial aspects will also have to be considered before \nnew solutions can be implemented. The cost of bringing \nnew technologies on line, for example, is often high \nand the complexity and varying nature of bio-waste can \nnecessitate costly separation processes and purification \n(Fava et al., 2015). As there is often a gap between \nlaboratory research and its transfer to industrial-scale \ncommercial application, improving the uptake and \n\napplication of research findings needs collaboration \nbetween researchers, industries and governments \n(Bhatia et al., 2018). Integrating different technologies \nat the same site is an opportunity to enhance energy \nefficiency and decrease operational costs (Fava et al., \n2015; Bhatia et al., 2018). The separation of bio-waste at \nsource is a basic condition for high-quality recycling of \nbio-waste (Sch\u00fcch et al., 2019).\n\nSource:  ETC/WMGE's own compilation.\n\nTable 6.1  Emerging technologies in bio-waste management: main opportunities and challenges\n\nTechnology Opportunities Challenges\n\nBioethanol production Bio-waste can serve as a sustainable \nalternative feedstock for the production of \nbioethanol \u2014 an important liquid biofuel.\n\nHigh processing costs and the \nheterogeneous nature of bio-waste create \nchallenges for industrial-scale bioethanol \nproduction.\n\nProducing volatile fatty acids \n(VFAs)\u00a0through anaerobic digestion \nof\u00a0bio-waste\n\nVFAs have a wide range of possible \nhigh-value end uses.\n\nExtraction of VFAs from bio-waste can be \nmore sustainable than the conventional \napproach of deriving VFAs from fossil fuels \nthrough chemical synthesis.\n\nThe most important challenges include \noptimising the operational parameters \nfor VFA production and cost-effective \nseparation of VFAs from digestate.\n\nProduction of biohydrogen Hydrogen demand is increasing and there \nis a need for sustainable methods for \nproducing it.\n\nLow substrate conversion efficiency and \nlow yield.\n\nRecovery of phosphorus Efficient recovery of phosphorus from \nbio-waste can reduce the dependence \non\u00a0limited geological resources.\n\nFurther technical development is needed \nto minimise operational costs and \nimprove the quality and predictability of \nthe fertilisers produced.\n\nPyrolysis Pyrolysis provides the possibility of \ntransforming low-energy-density materials \ninto high-energy-density biofuels. \n\nMaking pyrolysis economically viable \nremains a challenge.\n\nGasification A flexible technology that can be adapted \nto treat various materials. The gas \nproduced can be used as a fuel or for \nproducing chemicals.\n\nThe main challenges are finding solutions \nto deal with heterogeneous feedstocks, \nmaximising syngas yield, optimising \ngas quality and process efficiency and \ndecreasing production costs.\n\nHydrothermal carbonisation Converts bio-waste into hydrochar that \ncan be used as a solid fuel or soil improver \nor be further processed into activated \ncarbon.\n\nFurther technical development is needed \nfor industrial-scale applications.\n\nProduction of animal feed Direct use as animal feed, or potential \nsmall-scale bio-waste treatment methods \nto turn bio-waste into insect protein and \nlipids.\n\nLegal barriers hinder the development \nof valorising bio-waste as animal feed, \nfor example black soldier fly larvae \ntechnology.\n\f\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities42\n\nAbbreviations\n\nCO2 Carbon dioxide\n\nEEA European Environment Agency\n\nEionet European Environment Information and Observation Network\n\nETC/WMGE European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy\n\nEU European Union\n\nEU-28 The 28 EU Member States for the period 2013-2020\n\nEUR Euro (European monetary unit)\n\nFAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\nHTC Hydrothermal carbonisation\n\nNGO Non-governmental organisation\n\nNRC National reference centre\n\nSDG Sustainable Development Goal\n\nUN United Nations\n\nVAT Value-added tax\n\nVFA Volatile fatty acid\n\nWFD Waste Framework Directive\n\nAbbreviations\n\f\n43\n\nReferences\n\nBio-waste in Europe \u2014 turning challenges into opportunities\n\nAbeliotis, K., et al., 2015, 'The implications of food waste \ngeneration on climate change: the case of Greece', \nSustainable Production and Consumption 3, pp. 8-14 \n(DOI: 10.1016/j.spc.2015.06.006).\n\nAchinas, S., et al., 2017, 'A technological overview of \nbiogas production from biowaste', Engineering 3(3), \npp.\u00a0299-307.\n\nAllen, S. and Wentworth, J., 2011, Anaerobic digestion, \nNote POST-PN-387, Parliamentary Office of Science \nand Technology, London (https://researchbriefings.\nparliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POSTPN-387) accessed 2 October 2019.\n\nAntonopoulos, I.

However, there are no signs that the overall objective of reducing the total generation of waste is close to being achieved, according to a European Environment Agency report published today. The report\u2019s findings highlight opportunities to more effectively prevent waste, with textiles in the spotlight.\nPreventing waste is a key part of Europe\u2019s strategy in shifting to a resource-efficient and climate-neutral circular economy. Waste generation across Europe increased by 5.2% between 2014 and 2018, while GDP increased by 14.8 % in the EU according to the EEA reportThe same data trends also show that the adoption of the first waste prevention programmes by countries, applicable in most EU countries from 2013 or earlier, was insufficient to decrease the amount of waste generated.\nThe analysis shows that waste generation is still very dependent on developments in the economy, but, overall, the EU has been able to achieve a waste generation growth lower than the economic growth, or a so-called relative decoupling. Still, more needs to be done to ensure that waste decreases in real terms in a growing economy. The adoption of concrete targets \u2014 a strong driver of policy making \u2014 would help consolidate prevention policy at EU and national level.\nThe EEA analysis looked at national waste prevention programmes and specifically waste streams in focus, indicators, targets, and measures to prevent waste. The review revealed that, as of this year, 10 out of the 32 countries examined do not have a waste prevention programme in place, as required by EU legislation.\nTextile waste would benefit greatly from improved measures to prevent waste , as this is a fast-growing, environmentally impactful waste stream associated with unsustainable consumption patterns. The average European generates approximately 11 kg of textile waste per year.\nPreventing textile waste has great potential, mainly through reducing textile consumption, eco-design and ultimately reuse. To facilitate this, emphasis should be put on product design to promote durable and long-lasting materials, while support should be given to repair (e.g. with use of tax breaks) and reuse (e.g. through regulations).\nA separate EEA briefing, also published today, looks at the state of play for the trading of non-hazardous, recyclable waste within the EU. The briefing, besides supporting the ongoing review by the European Commission of the EU\u2019s Waste Shipment Regulation, offers insights on recyclables trading in the EU as well as potential solutions to help ensure that waste is treated in the best possible way in line with the principles of the waste hierarchy.\nMore than 90% of waste generated in the EU is treated in the country in which it was generated, respecting the EU\u2019s 'proximity principle' underpinning EU waste law. However, cross-border trading of non-hazardous, recyclable waste offers opportunities to find the environmentally-optimal treatment options, allowing good-quality secondary raw materials to be produced and respecting the principles of a circular economy.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/clear-opportunities-to-decouple-europes or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 09:07 AM\nFiled under: waste generation waste prevention waste hierarchy circular economy textile waste secondary raw materials\nFiled under: waste generation, waste prevention, waste hierarchy, circular economy, textile waste, secondary raw materials\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Overview of national waste prevention programmes in Europe\n\n\nOverview of national waste  \nprevention programmes in Europe\n\n2021\n\nCountry profile\n\n Photo: \u00a9  Mario Cvitkovic from Pixabay\n\nGermany\n\f\nGeneral information \n\n1.

Development process of the\nprogramme/revision\n\nThe revision of the programme has been based on a scientific \nresearch project initiated by the German Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) and the German Ministry of \nEnvironment. The review and evaluation of the implementation \nof the waste prevention plan (WPP) took place within the scope \nof the project. Based on the analysis of results for the \nimplementation of the WPP at federal, state and municipal \nlevels and an assessment of existing prevention potentials, \nproposals were made for a possible further development and \nupdating of the programme on prioritised waste streams and \ncorresponding priority prevention approaches. In addition, areas \nof the WPP needing structural adjustment, changes and further \nresearch were identified. (For further information see \nhttps://www.umweltbundesamt.de/publikationen/updating-thewaste-prevention-programme-preparing) \n\n8. Budget envisaged for\nimplementation of the project\n\nNo specific budget for the implementation of the programme is \nincluded in the programme. \n\f\nWaste generation \n \nThe following figures illustrate the progress towards waste prevention and decoupling of waste \ngeneration from economic growth in Germany. \n \nMunicipal solid waste \n\n\u2022 The generation of municipal waste per capita (see Figure 1) increased almost steadily from \n564 kg per capita in 2006 and reached its maximum in 2016 with 633 kg per capita. \n\n\u2022 The trend stagnated between 2011 and 2013 and stabilised at a higher level after 2014. \n\u2022 In addition, a decreasing trend can be seen since 2016, reaching a level of 606 kg per capita in \n\n2018. This reflects the implementation of the measures anchored in the WPP and the national \nresource efficiency programme. \n\n\u2022 This positive trend, however, also consists of a steep increase for some waste fractions, such \nas plastic packaging, and remains significantly above the European average (489 kg per \ncapita/year). \n\n\u2022 The 2011-2013 figures for municipal solid waste (MSW) generation are probably influenced \nby the global financial crisis that developed shortly before this period. \n\n\u2022 Germany\u2019s first WPP came into force in 2013 and, although MSW generation is influenced \nby many factors (population, household expenditure), the prevention measures in that WPP \nmight partially explain the positive trend in waste generation from 2014. \n\n \n \nFigure 1: Municipal waste generation in Germany (kg per capita), 2006-2019 \n\n \nSource: Eurostat Circular Economy Monitoring Framework. \n \nTotal waste \n\n\u2022 Germany\u2019s waste generation (excluding major mineral wastes) increased significantly until \n2014 and remained steady in the years that followed (see Figure 2). A similar trend can be \nobserved for Germany\u2019s GDP, except that it continued to increase after 2014. \n\n\u2022 Although a longer time series is needed to confirm any conclusions on decoupling, Germany \nseems to be on track to decouple total waste generation from economic growth. \n\n\u2022 A link between waste generation, which peaked in 2015, and population growth cannot be \nobserved. \n\n\u2022 Like MSW, the measures in Germany\u2019s first WPP, implemented in 2013, might partially \nexplain the positive total waste generation trend observed from 2014 onwards. \n\n \n\n500\n\n540\n\n580\n\n620\n\n660\n\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nWPP\n\f\nFigure 2: Growth rate of waste (excluding major mineral wastes), GDP, and population in Germany, \n2010-2018 (2010 = 100) \n\n \nSource: Eurostat.  \n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nWaste excluding major mineral wastes GDP Population\n\f\nWaste prevention programme \n \nObjectives and priorities \n \n\n1.

Target groups In addition to the first waste prevention programme that \nfocused on measures by public institutions, the new \nprogramme focuses on possible measures by the industry, \nhouseholds and other civil society actors \n\n \n  \n\f\nTargets, indicators and monitoring \n \n\n1.  Indicators proposed The German waste prevention programme includes several \nindicators for the reduction of specific waste streams, based \non the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other \nnational legislation, including: \n\u2022 food waste generation \n\u2022 reuse of specific product groups \u2014 indicator to be \n\ndeveloped based on the guidance from the European \nCommission currently under development \n\n\u2022 municipal solid waste intensity \n2.  Quantitative targets \u2022 70 % beverage containers must be reusable, based on the \n\nGerman packaging law \n\u2022 Halving food waste generation by 2030, based on the \n\nSDGs \n\u2022 Continued decrease in MSW at a rate comparable to that \n\nbetween 2004 and 2018 \n3.  Monitoring of programme \u2022 Waste intensity will be monitored based on annual \n\nreports by the German statistical office \n\u2022 The share of reusable packaging is monitored by annual \n\nreports in line with German packaging law \n4.  Evaluation of the programme The implementation of the programme will be evaluated after \n\n6 years. Based on the annual monitoring of the indicators \noutlined above, additional measures might be introduced to \nfulfil the indicated targets \n\n  \n\f\nPrevention measures \n \nPrevention measures \nimplemented measures in \naccordance with Article 9 of the \nWaste Framework Directive \n\nThe German waste prevention programme focuses on planned \nmeasures that aim to prevent waste and related environmental \nburdens.

Those results have been integrated into the \nselection and design of planned measures (see below.) \nThe programme also includes a variety of measures and actions that \ncould be taken by industry, households and other stakeholders. The \nprogramme is structured according to specific waste prevention \nconcepts (reuse, economic incentives, etc.) and specific waste \nstreams (single use plastics, food waste, etc.) \n\n \n \n  \n\f\nFood waste prevention \n \nFood waste generation \nIn 2015, the total amount of food waste generated in Germany reached almost 11.9 million tonnes, \nwith primary production accounting for 12 % (1.36 million tonnes); processing 18 % (2.17 million \ntonnes); trade 4 % (0.49 million tonnes) and out-of-home catering for 14 % (1.69 million tonnes). \nMore than half (6.14 million tonnes) was generated by private households, which is equivalent to \nabout 75 kg per person. \n \nMeasures to prevent food waste \nThe German government undertakes various measures to prevent the generation of food waste. For \ninstance, it provides around EUR 16 million for research programmes that investigate resource \nefficiency, food processing operations and the way consumers throw out food. In March 2020, a \nvoluntary agreement was signed between the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) and \nassociations from the food industry, agriculture and the hospitality sector aiming to reduce food \nwaste. \n \nFurthermore, in early 2019, the Federal Cabinet adopted the national strategy for food waste reduction \n(https://www.bmel.de/EN/topics/food-and-nutrition/food-waste/national-strategy-for-food-wastereduction.html). The strategy identifies potential drivers of food waste and pinpoints challenges and \nspheres of activities to reduce food waste along the entire food supply chain. \n \nThe strategy presents the reduction of food waste as a task for the whole of society, and stakeholders \nfrom civil society, entrepreneurs and scientists are called on to contribute. \n\n\u2022 This is to be achieved through participation in sectoral dialogue forums. Through \ncooperation between these sectors, specific measures for the reduction of food waste and \nsector-specific targets are to be established. \n\n\u2022 Representatives of the sectoral dialogue forums will participate in one overarching national \ndialogue forum to exchange experiences and views across sectors and assess the measures \nand progress resulting from the dialogue forums. It gathered for the first time in Berlin on \n6 November 2019 in the presence of the Federal Minister of Food, Julia Kl\u00f6ckner. \n\n\u2022 The joint body of the federal government and the L\u00e4nder is a key component in the \nimplementation process. It undertakes the tasks of an inter-ministerial, cross-L\u00e4nder \ngovernance instrument, monitors the evaluation process and identifies further fields of action. \n\n \nFor a more comprehensive mapping of country efforts to prevent food waste, please visit the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s Food Loss and Waste Prevention Hub. \n \n \nReuse of products \n \nData \nWith regard to the Commission Implementing Decision (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2021.010.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2021%3A01\n0%3ATOC), this section will be updated by the EEA accordingly. \n \nMeasures to support reuse \nVarious measures to support reuse are already included in the German waste prevention programme, \ne.g. the support for local reuse centres or guidelines for public procurement based on second-hand \nproducts. \n \nThe German EPA initiated a research project that aimed to collect data from reuse facilities to \ndetermine the quantities of reused products in Germany. This referred to both the direct reuse of \nsecond-hand products and waste products that have passed through the process of preparation for \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/eu-food-loss-waste-prevention-hub/eu-member-states\f\nreuse (end of waste) and are then available for reuse. In addition, the quantities of used products \nprocessed via internet-based platforms were estimated and a comprehensive online survey of almost \n400 reuse facilities in Germany conducted. Furthermore, online offers were recorded at the auction \nplatform eBay.de over a period of 1 month in a total of five regions. As a result, the total quantities of \nthe product groups considered (electrical and electronic equipment, furniture and textiles) that are \nalready being reused or prepared for reuse in Germany have been estimated to be between 286 366 \nand 297 201 tonnes per year. Comparing the quantities processed via reuse facilities with the \nquantities via eBay, the importance of internet-based platforms in the electronic sector has been \nshown. Conversely, reuse facilities appear to have certain prerequisites for textiles and, particularly, \nfurniture. A follow-up project is planned that will develop a process for an annual collection of data \non reuse and its provision to the European Commission. Hence, a database on specific measures will \nbe established by public authorities to support reuse. \n \n  \n\f\nBest practice examples \n \nBerlin: model city for green procurement \nStudies show that environmentally compatible procurement can achieve high greenhouse gas savings, \nbut also relevant cost savings. In order for the state of Berlin to focus on procurement that promotes \nand requires environmentally compatible services and products on a binding basis, the \n\u2018Administrative Regulation on Procurement and the Environment\u2019 came into force on 1 January 2013 \n(last updated at the beginning of 2019). This applies to all public procurement agencies in Berlin. \nUsing performance sheets, concrete ecological requirement criteria are made binding for the \nprocurement of various products, construction and services. Tools for calculating life cycle costs are \nalso included. In the area of waste prevention, the procurement of beverages in disposable packaging, \ndisposable tableware and cutlery in canteens and refectories and at large events, as well as products \nwhose cardboard transport packaging does not contain at least 70 % recycled material, are not \npermitted. In the case of products for IT equipment, among other things, the availability of spare parts \nand the possibility of repairing them or expanding their performance with replaceable components and \nexpansion interfaces must be guaranteed, even several years after production has ceased. Larger \nconstruction projects must be built in accordance with the BNB system for sustainable construction: \nthe use of recycled concrete is required, as is a process for recycling materials in the event of the \nbuilding being dismantled in future. The next update of the administrative regulation is to include the \nuse of recycled plastic packaging. \n \n\nKiel on its way to becoming a \u2018zero waste city\u2019 \n\nThe state capital Kiel is currently on its way to becoming a \u2018zero waste city\u2019. Kiel is the first city in \nGermany to join the international Zero Waste Europe network and is therefore pursuing the goal of \navoiding waste at all levels, conserving resources and thus further reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \nFunded by the BMU and supported by the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, \nthe state capital is drawing up a long-term zero waste concept in 2020 in which potentials were assessed, \ntargets defined and measures identified to significantly reduce the amount of waste in the Kiel city area \nin the coming decades. The basis of the zero waste concept is the five-stage waste hierarchy, in which \navoidance is the top priority. To reduce waste across the board and in all sectors, the city administration \nis involving the general public in a wide-ranging participation process at the concept development stage. \nAs soon as the concept is completed, it will be submitted to the city council for approval and the active \nimplementation phase will begin. With this decision, Kiel is striving to achieve official certification as \na \u2018zero waste city\u2019. \n\n  \n\f\nLinks to the circular economy \n \nWaste prevention is an integral part of the comprehensive transformation towards a circular economy. \nIt reduces not only the input of natural resources into the economy but also the efforts required to \ncollect and recycle waste. \n \nApproaches to improving circularity are often linked to successful waste prevention.

Methodology report.\nThe industrial emissions country profiles present the emissions of air and water pollutants and greenhouse gases in fact sheets for each country. The significance of industry, given by gross value added, energy consumption and water use, as well as generation of waste are added to the presentation. The trend in emissions and waste generation are given in relative numbers. The scope of industry in this respect includes in short all industrial activities reported under the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) excluding agriculture (activity code 7.(a) and 7.(b)). The data sources to the country profiles include Eurostat, the E-PRTR, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) and air pollutant emission inventories reported under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP).11 Sep 2020\nPrepared by:\nTorleif Weydahl (NILU), Katrina Young (Aether), Kathryn Hampshire (Aether), Justin Goodwin (Aether), Marthe Granger (EEA), Bastian Zeiger (EEA).\nThe industrial emissions country profiles summarise key data related to industry: its relevance with respect to economic contributions, energy and water consumption, as well as air and water emissions and waste generation. The country profiles are developed for the EEA-33 countries which includes the 28 EU Member States together with Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.\nThe present revision (v. 3.0) of this report includes data available at date of release. This year, a new reporting, the so-called EU-Registry and thematic data reporting, is introduced in order to gather the former E-PRTR, LCP and IED reportings and finally replace them. The 2018 data are not yet readily available. Nevertheless, more quality checks have been performed on the latest E-PRTR database in order to have the cleanest final E-PRTR dataset possible. Hence, the industrial emissions country profiles are enriched with the most up-to-date data sources while still only covering the years up to 2017.\nThis report describes the underlying methodology to the industrial emissions country profiles that are presented as a Tableau story on the EEA webpages ([1]).\nThe scope of industry in this respect includes in short all industrial activities reported under the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) excluding agriculture (activity code 7.(a) and 7.(b)). The data sources include Eurostat, the E-PRTR, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) and air pollutant emission inventories reported under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), each of which have their own data categories. A recently developed EEA-mapping which align these different categories is used ([2]). The data sources and industry scope is presented in full detail in the Annexes following this report.\nThe water and air pollutants including greenhouse gases are selected based on criteria related to their relative impact. Emissions of heavy metals to air and water have been combined by weighted averages using both eco toxicology and human toxicology characterisation factors ([3]). The amounts of hazardous and non-hazardous waste reported under Eurostat is presented, but excluding the major mineral waste that dominates the mining and construction sectors.\nThe data quality is evaluated and gap filling of Eurostat data is performed when needed. A method for E-PRTR outlier handling is proposed and applied where appropriate.\nThe significance of industry, given by gross value added (GVA), energy consumption and water use, as well as generation of waste are presented in the Tableau story as a sector percentage of EEA-33 gross total as well as percentage of country total. The trend in air and water pollution is presented as totals per pollutants relative to the latest year (2017). For the latest year the emissions are also given as percentage per sector relative to country total. The details on how the presented data is processed and aggregated is described in Annex 2.\nThe report is to a large extent based on previous methodology reports for \u201cIndustrial pollution country profiles\u201d, but is also further developed to reflect feedback received through Eionet review and general requests from EEA and the European Commission.\n[1] https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/industry/industrial-pollution\n[2] https://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/nomenclature_emission\n[3] USEtox, 2017, 'USEtox (corrective release 2.1)' https://www.usetox.org/model/download/usetox2.1 accessed May 2019\n\n../2019\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nUpdated July 2020\n\nEEA-33 Industrial Emissions Country Profiles \n\nAuthors:  \n\nTorleif Weydahl (NILU), Katrina Young (Aether) \n\nKathryn Hampshire (Aether), Justin Goodwin (Aether) \n\nMarthe Granger (EEA), Bastian Zeiger (EEA) \n\n \n\nETC/ATNI consortium partners:  \nNILU \u2013 Norwegian Institute for Air Research, Aether Limited, Czech \nHydrometeorological Institute (CHMI), EMISIA SA, Institut National de \nl\u2019Environnement Industriel et des risques (INERIS), Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de \nBarcelona (UAB), Umweltbundesamt GmbH (UBA-V), 4sfera Innova, \nTransport & Mobility Leuven NV (TML) \n\nMethodology report \n\f\n \n\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 \n\n \n\n \n\nCover photo - CC0 Public Domain,  Image by Frauke Feind from Pixabay \n \nLegal notice \nThe contents of this publication do not necessarily reflect the official opinions of the European Commission or other institutions \nof the European Union.

These \npressures are caused by emissions of different types of pollutants originating from a variety of \nindustrial processes.  \n \nIn order to better describe environmental pressures from industry, the European Environment Agency \n(EEA), together with the European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, Noise and Industrial \nPollution (ETC/ATNI) and the previous ETC/ACM (European Topic Centre on Air pollution and Climate \nchange Mitigation), have developed country profiles on industrial emissions in Europe (4). This report \npresents the methodology for developing the profiles and how the different pressures are quantified. \n \nThe aim of the country profiles is to provide insights into the key industrial pressures in the EEA \nmember countries and, therefore, contribute to decision making. These country profiles can also be \nused to inform the research and scientific communities on data issues that prevent analysis and clear \ndecision making. The profiles aim to monitor the progress of, and present findings on the state of \nindustrial emissions. For the period of time 2007 to 2017 the addition of EEA-33 and EU-28 profiles \nenables a broader overview of industrial emissions in Europe. \n \n\n2 Scope \n\nThis chapter outlines the scope of categories and pollutants included in the profiles. The scope has \nbeen designed to enable the consistent analysis of the emissions to air and water from industrial \nactivities. \n\n2.1 Definition of industry \n\nThere are different definitions of industry depending on the use of particular data sources and \nperspectives of interest. The questions tackled in this methodology report include whether or not \n\u2018industry\u2019 should be considered in its widest sense i.e. to include agriculture, transport associated with \nthe movement of goods, transport associated with employees travelling to work, or waste generation \nand disposal. \n \nFirst, however, it is useful to consider the different data sources available. These include Eurostat, the \nEuropean Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported \nunder the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) and air pollutant emission inventories reported \nunder the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), each of which have their \nown data categories. As such, it is important to have a clear understanding of how these sources and \ncategories relate to each other, and which categories should be included in \u2018industry\u2019. The objective of \nthis section is therefore to provide a transparent presentation of the scope of industry within the \nprofiles. \n \nThe E-PRTR contains the data reported annually by industrial facilities that exceed capacity thresholds, \nand covers 65 economic activities within nine industrial sectors. These data cover pollutant releases to \nair, water and land (soil). This is the main data source for the profiles, because of the detailed level of \nreporting, the high spatial resolution and the fact that reporting is mandatory, annual, and with time \nseries since 2007. It should be kept in mind that the data are a subset of total industry emissions, as \nthey cover only emissions above certain thresholds that result from the activities covered. The E-PRTR \nalso gives the emissions (greater than the thresholds) from industrial facilities being sent for treatment \n\n \n \n4 https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/industry/industrial-pollution. \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/industry/industrial-pollution\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 7 \n\nby wastewater treatment plants, so-called \u2018transfers\u2019 or \u2018indirect releases\u2019. These emissions which are \nnot directly released in the environment, are not considered in the country profiles (see also Section \n2.2.4). \n \nData on economic activities within the European Union (EU) are grouped into categories based on the \nstatistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE), and are available \nfrom Eurostat. NACE coding is hierarchical and consists of a first-division level with an alphabetical \ncode, and three further levels with two-, three- and four-digit numerical codes, respectively. The \neconomic activities within the E-PRTR are used to select which economic activities within NACE should \nbe used with regard to industry. Based on these considerations, NACE divisions B, C, D and E are \nincluded in industry as outlined in Table 2-1. \n \n\nTable 2-1: NACE divisions. \n\nNACE division code NACE division name \n\nB Mining and quarrying  \n\nC Manufacturing  \n\nD Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply  \n\nE Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities \n\n \nNational inventories of emissions to air are reported in separate national inventories for GHGs and air \npollutants. Air pollutant emissions are reported under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary \nAir Pollution (CLRTAP) using Nomenclature for Reporting (NFR) categories. Greenhouse gas emissions \nare reported under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) to the EEA using Common Reporting \nFormat (CRF) categories. \n \nTo ensure a consistent approach with regard to the activities included in \u2018industry\u2019, these data sources \nhave been aligned using the mapping of industrial sectors developed by the EEA (1) in collaboration \nwith the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET) (2018 consultation). \nThe EEA-mapping has been developed based on mapping all industrial categories following NFR, CRF, \nMMR, Annex I to the E PRTR regulation and the NACE divisions, to an overarching division of sectors \nand sub-sectors. The structure of industry sectors and sub-sectors covering the thematic scope of the \ncountry profiles are shown in Table 2-2. The exception is the EEA sector \u2018Energy supply\u2019 which is always \npresented as the main EEA sector. The less aggregated EEA sub-sectors are applied to the presentation \nof air and water pollutant emissions and waste data. The more aggregated EEA sectors are applied \nwhen presenting Gross Value Added (GVA), Energy consumption and water use. \n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 8 \n\nTable 2-2: EEA sectors and sub-sectors covering the scope of the country profiles. \n\nEEA sectors EEA sub-sectors  \nEnergy supply Energy supply (*)  \n\nExtractive industry Extractive industry \n\nManufacturing industry Ferrous metal \n\nNon-ferrous metal \n\nNon-metallic minerals \n\nChemicals \n\nPulp, paper and wood \n\nFood and drink \n\nOther manufacturing \n\nWaste Waste management \n\nWastewater treatment \n(*) The sub-sectors for Energy supply from the EEA-mapping is not used. \n\n \nThe mapping table (Mapping Version 1) of the data sources is available on the EIONET Central Data \nRepository (5). The list of codes for these reporting systems included in the profiles is presented in \nAnnex 1. A summary of what is included in the profiles is given in Box 2.1. An overview of the data \nsources used and the date when they have been accessed is provided in Table 2-3. \n \n\nBox 2.1: Thematic scope of the profiles. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n5 https://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/nomenclature_emission. \n\nThe scope of the country profiles spans multiple data sources, each with differing activity scope and \ncoding systems. The activities included in the profiles are those falling into the categories of energy \nsupply, extractive industry, waste (including waste management and wastewater treatment) and \nmanufacturing industry (including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic minerals, chemicals, \npulp, paper and wood, food and drink and other manufacturing). A mapping of the categories and \noverview of how this has changed from the previous mapping is available in Annex 1. Some profiles \nalso include the grouping \u201cNon industry\u201d (comprising all other activities) to provide context. \n \nThe energy used for transport related to these industries is not included (except pipelines for the \ntransmission of energy). Agricultural activities are also not included, because of the often diffuse and \ncountry-specific nature of such data, which makes cross-comparisons inappropriate. Major mineral \nwaste, typically from Mining and quarrying and Construction, is excluded from the waste analysis \nnot to dominate the trend over other waste types and sectors. \n \nThe source codes of the data included are presented in Annex 1. In summary, these include: \n\n\u2022 NACE divisions B, C, D and E \n\n\u2022 NFR14 categories 1A1, 1A2, 1B, 2 (except 2A5b) and 5 \n\n\u2022 CRF 2006 categories 1A1, 1A2, 1B, 1C, 2 and 5 (except 5F) \n\n\u2022 E-PRTR sectors: all except 7a, 7b \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 9 \n\nTable 2-3: Data sources used for the country profiles, the latest year data available at the time of publishing. \n\nData source Use Reporting \nupdates \n\nReference Latest year data \navailable for 2020 \npublication of the \ncountry profiles \n\nEurostat Economy (GVA) Annual Eurostat (2020a) 2017 \n\nEurostat Energy consumption Annual Eurostat (2020b) 2017 \n\nEurostat Water use Annual Eurostat (2020c) 2016 \n\nEurostat Waste generation Biennial  Eurostat (2020d) 2016 \n\nEEA Emissions to air (CLRTAP) Annual EEA (2019a) 2017 \n\nEEA Industry emissions to water \nand air (E-PRTR) \n\nAnnual EEA (2020)  2017 \n\nEEA GHG emissions (MMR) Annual EEA (2019b) 2017 \n\nInternational \nEnergy \nAgency (IEA) \n\nIndustry energy consumption \n(gap-filling data) \n\nAnnual IEA (2019)  2016 \n\nWorld Bank Industry GVA (gap-filling data) Annual World Bank \n(2019a, 2019b) \n\n2017 \n\nUSEtox \n(release 2.11) \n\nEco toxicology and human \ntoxicology characterisation \nfactors \n\n- USEtox (2017) \n \n\n \nData for all 33 EEA member countries (the 28 EU Member States (EU-28) together with Iceland, \nLiechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, known collectively as the EEA-33) are not always \navailable from these data sources. Alternative data sources such as the International Energy Agency \nand the World Bank were used in such instances where possible (see Section 3.3 \u2018Gap filling\u2019). \n\nExclusions \n\nWithin the initial scope of the E-PRTR sectors and NACE divisions B, C, D and E, some sectors have been \nexcluded from the definition of industry. These exclusions are summarised below. \n \n\n\u2022 Common Reporting Format (CRF) and NFR sector 3 \u2014 \u2018Agriculture\u2019 \u2014 has been excluded. The \nreasons for this exclusion are as follows: for specific substances (especially nutrients), \nagricultural discharges will be difficult to quantify, and relatively difficult to compare among \nthe countries because of local conditions, monitoring efforts and different quantification \nmethods. \n\n\u2022 E-PRTR sectors 7a and 7b \u2014 \u2018Installations for the intensive rearing of poultry or pigs\u2019 and \n\u2018Intensive aquaculture\u2019 \u2014 have been excluded. These were excluded as they constitute \nactivities which, e.g. in the NFR classification, are attributed to a sector different from the \nindustry sector. \n\n\u2022 CRF sector 5F \u2013 \u201cLong-term C storage\u201d. This is a memo item (reported but not included in the \nnational total emissions), and is not consistently reported across countries. \n\n\u2022 NFR14 activity 2A5b \u2013 \u201cConstruction and demolition\u201d. This is categorised as a Residential & \nCommercial activity under the EEA mapping (1) \n\n\u2022 NACE activity E36 \u2013 \u201cWater collection, treatment and supply\u201d. This is categorised as a \nResidential & Commercial activity under the latest EEA mapping. The exclusion of E36 is only \nfeasible for GVA. For Waste, Energy and Water use it is combined with other categories and \ncannot be separated without excluding other categories that is included in the definition of \nindustry. \n\n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 10 \n\nThe E-PRTR category 5f \u2013 \u2018Urban Waste Water Treatment Plants\u2019 (UWWTP) is included in the profiles \nin order to have the overall industrial emissions to water represented, even though only a limited \npart of the waste water released by UWWTP  originate from industrial waste water. \n\n2.2 Pollutants considered \n\nThe overall focus is on pollutants under specific industrial legislation. The profiles therefore do not \ntrack emerging pollutants. The pollutants included in this analysis have been determined based on \nmultiple criteria, and are presented in Table 2-4 for air and Table 2-5 for water. \n \n\n2.2.1 Air pollutants \n\nFour factors were considered with regard to the inclusion of air pollutants. To be included in the \nprofiles, pollutants must first meet the policy-related criteria (it must be included in a relevant piece \nof legislation). It must then meet at least one of the subsequent pressures and impacts criteria which \nrelate to specific challenges posed by a pollutant. Finally, the quality of the data on the pollutant must \nbe acceptable. In summary, for inclusion in the profiles: \n \nPolicy criteria  \n\n \nP1: the pollutant must be covered by the Industrial Emissions Directive \n\n(IED) (EC, 2010)(6)  \nand \n \n\nPressures/Impacts criteria  \n \nP/I1: more than half of the emissions of the pollutant to air must have \n\noccurred within industry for at least one year between 2007 and 2017, \ncalculated as a percentage of industry emission data (E-PRTR) of total \nemissions in national inventories (LRTAP); \n\nor \n \nP/I2: the proportion of the pollutant\u2019s emissions to air within industry must \n\nbe increasing (E-PRTR industry emissions as a percentage of national \ninventories, since 2007); \n\nor \n \nP/I3: the pollutant must be responsible for the largest aggregate damage\nassociated costs by industrial facilities (calculated by the EEA (2014) \nreport Costs of air pollution from European industrial facilities 2008\u2013\n2012) (7). \n\n \nSOER: reported in E-PRTR by >=5% of facilities in EEA sector, SOER \n\naggregation or EEA sub-sector (2007-2011 average) \n \n\n \n \n6 EC, 2010, Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions \n(integrated pollution prevention and control)  \n(http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:334:0017:0119:en:PDF) accessed May 2019. \n7 EEA, 2014, Costs of air pollution from European industrial facilities 2008\u20132012.

The heavy metals are evaluated against the \npressure/impacts criteria as a pollutant group not as individual pollutants. \n \nDioxins and Furans (PCDD and PCDF) and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are included \nbecause they are considered as key pollutants in the European environment state and outlook report \n(SOER) (8). The pollutant reported in E-PRTR by 5% or more of facilities in EEA sector, SOER aggregation \nor EEA sub-sector (2007-2011 average) is then considered of relevance with regard to the historical \nbackground. However, the pollutants are only presented on the EU-level (EEA33 and EU28) because \nthere are too few E-PRTR facilities concerned to have it relevant at a national level. \n \nThe heavy metals emissions to air are grouped by taking the weighted sum using the USEtox \ncharacterisation factors (9) as given in Table 2-4. The heavy metals are presented both as a weighted \nsum of human toxicity and eco toxicity factors to illustrate both the ecosystem and human impact. The \nEcotox CF is the endpoint eco toxicity characterisation factor (Em.airU) given as the potentially \ndisappeared fraction of species per kilogram emitted [PDF.m3.day/kgemitted]. The Human tox CF is the \nendpoint human health characterization factor for rural air (cancer and non-cancer) given as the \ndisability-adjusted life year per kilogram emitted [DALY/kgemitted]. The factors are from the USEtox \nrelease version 2.11. The following assumption has been made: air emissions were assumed to be to \ncontinental rural air. \n \nDue to the relatively high USEtox factor on Copper and compounds (as Cu), the country profiles \nemission trends for Heavy metals will be dominated by the trends in Copper emissions when \nconsidering eco toxicity. When considering human toxicity, the emissions trends for Heavy metals will \nbe dominated by Mercury. For Chromium (Cr) the USEtox factors distinguish between trivalent \nChromium, Cr(III), which is relatively harmless and Hexavalent Chromium, Cr(VI), which is highly toxic. \nThis division is not taken into account in the reported E-PRTR and CLRTAP emission. A ratio of Cr(VI) to \nCr(Total) of 14% in industrial emissions is proposed based on a study (10) on power plants. Due to the \nlack of knowledge about the ratio of As(III) and As(V) in industrial emissions, a flat average of the two \nUSEtox factors is used as an approximation. As(III) and As(V) have the same Human toxicity CF for \nemissions to air. \n \n\n \n \n8 EEA, 2015, The European environment: state and outlook 2015, European Environment Agency \n(http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer) accessed May 2019. \n9 USEtox, 2017, 'USEtox (corrective release 2.1)' https://www.usetox.org/model/download/usetox2.1 accessed May 2019. \n10 French et al., 1998, Study of Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions from Electric Utility Steam Generating Units -- Final Report \nto Congress.

The total greenhouse \ngases reported as CO2-equivalent under the MMR is used in the country profiles. This includes besides \nCO2, methane (CH4), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), nitrous oxide (N2O) and some fluorine containing \ngases. CO2-equivalent of components besides CO2 account for about 18 percent of the total \ngreenhouse gas emission in the EU-28 over the years 2013-2017 where CH4 accounts for about 10 \npercent and N2O about 5 percent . Some of the minor F-gases are reported by a reduced number of \ncountries, but the contribution to the total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2-equvivalents is overall \nvery small (about 2 to 3 percent).

For inclusion in the \nprofiles, pollutants must first meet the policy-related criteria and then at least one of the subsequent \npressures and impacts criteria, and the quality of the data on the pollutant must be acceptable. In \nsummary, for inclusion in the country profiles: \n \nPolicy criteria \n\nP1:  the pollutant must be covered by the IED (EC, 2010) (6), the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD) (EC, 2000) (14) or the OSPAR (Convention \nfor the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East \nAtlantic) list of chemicals for priority action; \n\nand \n \n\nPressures/Impacts criteria \n \n\nP/I1:  the pollutant must be highlighted as having a potentially significant \nimpact on health in water (determined through the toxicity, \nbioavailability and bioaccumulation potential); \n\nor \n \nP/I2: the pollutant must have significant eutrophication impacts on water \n\nand ecosystems; \nor \n \nP/I3:   the substance must affect the oxygen balance of water. \n\n \n\nThe WFD\u2019s list of priority substances covers 45 substances or groups of substances, of which 21 are \npriority hazardous substances (EC, 2013) (15). In 2018 there have been several activities to review and \ndiscuss the Water Framework Directive, including a two year initiative to support exchange between \nexperts and Competent Authorities for the improvement of the Water Framework Directive (16). \nAlthough the E-PRTR covers the WFD priority substances, and other substances, the data quality and \nconsistency of reporting across countries is sufficient for only a small selection of water pollutants. \nPollutants outside this selection are not included in the profiles because of the poor quality of the data \nreported in the E PRTR. For this reason polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins and furans \nare not reported as national profiles. Still, PAHs have sufficient data quality to be given on an EU-level \n(EEA33 and EU28). \n \nTable 2-5 summarises the water pollutants that are included in the profiles with the pressures/impacts \nmet. The heavy metals are evaluated against the pressure/impacts criteria as a pollutant group not as \nindividual pollutants. It must be emphasised that this list of pollutants does not cover numerous \norganic pollutants, pesticides and emerging compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and micro plastics. \n\n \n \n14 EC, 2000, Directive 2000/60/EC of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water \npolicy (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32000L0060) accessed May 2019. \n15 EC, 2013, Directive 2013/39/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 amending Directives \n2000/60/EC and 2008/105/EC as regards priority substances in the field of water policy Text with EEA relevance, (https://eurlex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0039) accessed August 2019. \n16 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/index_en.htm. \n\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32000L0060\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 14 \n\nAgriculture, which is the main sector for pesticides emissions, is also not considered as part of the \nindustry sector in the profiles. \n \n\nTable 2-5: Water pollutants included in the industrial country profiles. \n\nPollutant \nAbbreviation \n\nEcotox CF \n[PDF.m3.day / \nkgemitted] \n\nHuman tox CF \n[DALY / \nkgemitted] \n\nGroup \nPressures/ \nImpacts \ncriteria met \n\nArsenic and compounds (as As) As 1.39E+04 (*) 7.21E-02 \n\nHeavy Metal P/I1 \n\nCadmium and compounds (as Cd) Cd 1.14E+06 1.29E-02 \n\nChromium and compounds (as Cr) Cr 2.52E+04 (**)  5.01E-02 (**) \n\nCopper and compounds (as Cu) Cu 4.96E+06 3.69E-07 \n\nLead and compounds (as Pb) Pb 3.44E+02 1.38E-04 \n\nMercury and compounds (as Hg) Hg 1.10E+04 5.02E-02 \n\nNickel and compounds (as Ni) Ni 1.49E+05 1.39E-03 \n\nZinc and compounds (as Zn) Zn 6.66E+04 7.13E-04 \n\nTotal nitrogen Tot-N - - \nInorganic \nsubstances \n\nP1, P/I2 \n\nTotal phosphorus Tot-P - - \nInorganic \nsubstances \n\nP1, P/I2 \n\nTotal organic carbon TOC   \nOrganic \nsubstances \n\nP1, P/I3 \n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs   \nInorganic \nsubstances \n\nP1, P/I2 \n\n(*) The factor proposed is a flat average between As(III) and As(V). \n(**) A ratio of Cr(VI) to Cr(Total) of 44% is used to estimate the average USEtox factor.

Sustainability 2019, 11(6), 1655. https://doi.org/10.3390/su11061655. \n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su11061655\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 15 \n\n2.2.4 Waste \n\nWaste can be seen as any substance or object which the holder discards or intends / is required to \ndiscard. As per the Waste Directive adopted in 2018, it can also be seen as a resource through reuse \nand recycling. The Directive therefore dictates that waste management should be transformed into \nsustainable material management (18). The country profiles cover all waste generated by the relevant \nsectors, which is treated in a variety of ways including recovery, incineration and landfill (among \nothers). The \u2018major mineral waste\u2019 is, however, excluded from the profiles. This is the very large \nquantities from the mining and construction (demolition) operations, which when included dominate \nthe contribution from other sectors. For EU-28, about 65% of the total waste mass is \u2018major mineral \nwaste\u2019. Although the quantity of waste undergoing different end-of-life treatments is an important \nissue, the profiles do not distinguish between the different treatment types because the focus is on \nlevel of waste generation by different sectors. \n \nHowever, the profiles do group waste materials into two hazard levels: hazardous waste and nonhazardous waste. Materials classified as non-hazardous are easier to re-use, recycle and treat than \nhazardous waste. Hazardous waste include those materials and products that contain hazardous \nsubstances and can pose a risk to health or the environment if not managed and disposed of correctly. \nThe Waste Directive states that measures to reduce the contents of hazardous substances in materials \nand products should be promoted. The properties of waste that render it hazardous are defined in \nAnnex III of the Waste Directive and include, inter alia, explosive, flammable, toxic and carcinogenic \nproperties. (19) \n \nThe E-PRTR also include data on waste, however, waste transfers only, i.e. off-site movement of waste. \nThis means that all waste that is managed on-site is not reported to the E-PRTR. In addition the \nreporting thresholds in E-PRTR excludes waste transfers below 2 000 tonnes (for non-hazardous waste) \nand 2 tonnes (for hazardous waste) and only the larger industrial facilities are included. Hence, the \nEurostat data is more complete and therefore used for the country profiles. (20) \n \n\n2.2.5 Soil pollutants \n\nUnder E-PRTR, releases to soils are reported in few cases only, and after 2014, only for 4 of the EEA33 \ncountries. No other inventory gives complete dataset. Soil pollutants may be defined and included in \nfuture versions of the profiles. \n \n \n\n3 Data quality \n\n3.1 General considerations \n\nE-PRTR \n\nThe quality of the data reported to the E-PRTR is the responsibility of operators and national \ncompetent authorities. However, the EEA, with the ETC/ATNI, quality-checks the E-PRTR data set. \n\n \n \n18 EC, 2018, Directive 2018/851/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and \nrepealing certain directives. \n(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1530001632550&uri=CELEX:32018L0851) accessed May 2019. \n19 Note that the relatively large quantities of hazardous waste from the Estonian Energy sector is from shale oil extraction \n\nproducing a lot of combustion waste (bottom- and fly ashes). \n20 https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/industrial-waste-indicator/assessment-1. \n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/industrial-waste-indicator/assessment-1\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 16 \n\nWhile the E PRTR provides comprehensive information on emissions from large industrial sources, the \ncompleteness and consistency of reporting across countries varies. The overall accuracy can be \ncompromised by a small number of significant outliers. Further improvements in the data quality \nwould increase the robustness of the fact sheet data. \n \nMoreover, only industrial operators meeting certain activity and emissions thresholds are captured in \nE-PRTR data. \n\nWater emissions \n\nAlthough there are a number of reporting obligations with regard to water emissions, none of the \ncurrent databases cover all relevant sources and pathways of pollutants to water. As such, it is not \npossible to compare the industrial discharges to water with the total discharges from all economic \nactivities on a regular basis. For this reason, we can only compare emissions to water from each \nindustrial sub-sector with total industrial emissions to water (from the E-PRTR), rather than comparing \nit to overall emissions to water. Therefore, the significance of industry with regard to water emissions \nas a whole cannot be assessed. \n \nThe WFD\u2019s daughter directive\u2019s (EC, 2013) list of priority substances covers 45 substances or groups of \nsubstances, of which 21 are priority hazardous substances. Some of these have been excluded from \nthe country profiles because of the poor quality of the data reported in the E-PRTR. For a more accurate \nrepresentation of industrial emissions to water, an effort in the reporting of more complete and \nreliable data in the E-PRTR will have to be done. \n \n\n3.2 A method for handling outlier E-PRTR data \n\nThe E-PRTR is based on data reported from the EU Member States to the EEA. The E-PRTR data \ncollection process involves several steps of quality control and assurance. Nevertheless, data that are \nlikely to result from erroneous reporting can still remain in the E-PRTR. Through the evaluation process \nof the country profiles, it has been proposed to have a mechanism for removing such outliers before \nthe data are presented in the profiles. \n \nA method for outlier handling has been applied to the E-PRTR dataset: \n \n\n1. Consider the trend in air and water pollutants for each country as a total and identify sudden \nchanges between years.  \n\n2. Investigate if there is a single facility behind possible sudden changes that are identified \n3. Check if this facility is part of the Findings-log from the E-PRTR review process, and if it contains \n\ninformation that explains the behaviour. \n4. Based on the E-PRTR findings-log and/or a general expert judgement whether the sudden \n\nchange is likely, the facility and emissions are added to the list of outliers. \n5. A new value replaces the value considered to be an outlier on the basis of the previous value \n\nreported by the same facility or the value that would correspond a change of units if the issue \nidentified is a unit mistake. \n\n6. A table of outliers and replacing values will be proposed, EEA project manager verifies and \napproves, and then the list is posted in the ETC website for reference by the country profiles \nas a link in a generic note to the graphs that documents that some values have been replaced \ndue to the outlier checking. \n\n \nThe outlier handling procedure will be limited to outliers of a magnitude such that they influence the \ntrends of the total EU-28 or EEA-33. A file listing the outliers is available for download. \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 17 \n\n3.3 Gap filling \n\nThe aim of the country profiles is to cover industrial emissions in all EEA-33 countries (21). A profile for \nthe EEA-33 and EU-28 is also provided. However, not all of the data sources cover all of the countries. \nIf data are missing, a gap-filling methodology was followed. \n\nFinal energy consumption \u2014 industry \n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (22) energy balances can be used as an alternative data source for \nthe countries with no data in Eurostat. The scope of industry with regard to the IEA data is the same \nas Eurostat data, except that construction data are also included in the IEA data. It is not possible to \nremove these construction data in order to match the scopes completely. No Eurostat or IEA data were \navailable for Liechtenstein. \n \n2017 data was available for all countries but Liechtenstein at the time of publishing, hence no gap \nfilling was needed for Energy consumption. \n \n\nWater use by sector \n\nFor almost all countries, the time-series Eurostat data for water use in industrial sectors and total water \nuse are incomplete or missing. For each supply source (public water supply and/or self and other water \nsupply), data from the latest available year were used. To avoid inconsistency, data for total water use \nand water use per NACE sector was taken from the same year and not extrapolated between years. \nThe selected years are summarized in Table 3-1. If the Eurostat data are insufficient to calculate an \nindustry water use as percentage of total use (\u2018public water use\u2019 and \u2018self and other water supply\u2019), \nthe industry water use is reported as \u2018None\u2019. This applied to Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, \nHungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovakia,  Portugal, Romania and United \nKingdom . No data is reported for Liechtenstein. \n \n\n \n \n21 Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, \nIreland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, \nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. \n22 IEA, 2019, Sankey, \u2018Final energy consumption\u2019 (http://www.iea.org/Sankey/index.html) accessed 14 August 2018. \n\nhttp://www.iea.org/Sankey/index.html\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 18 \n\nTable 3-1 Selected year and available data sources for water use.

Two indicators were combined to obtain the industry GVA. National gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) was obtained from World Bank data (23,24) and converted into millions of euros using \naverage annual USD to EUR exchange rates from AMECO (2019). The second data set, industry as a \npercentage of national GDP, was used to calculate industry GVA in millions of euros. Non-industry GVA \nwas calculated by subtracting this industry GVA from national GDP. The World Bank\u2019s definition of \nindustry is the same as Eurostat\u2019s, except that construction is also included in the World Bank\u2019s \ndefinition. \u2018Industry total\u2019 was the most detailed level of data available, so it was not possible to \nremove these construction data in order to match the scopes completely. Gap-filling based on this \nprocedure was performed for Liechtenstein, Malta and Turkey. \n \nFor these countries, the alternative data are indicated in the profiles by showing only the allocation to \n\u2018Industry (no detail)\u2019. It is evaluated if the NACE sector division (in percentage) from previous year \nEurostat data can be applied in addition. \n \nFor United Kingdom, some data are missing for some of the NACE activities in the Eurostat data for \n2017. A linear extrapolation calculation was performed using the trend from 2013 through 2016.  \n \n\n \n \n23 World Bank, 2019a, \u2018Industry, value added (% of GDP)\u2019, ( http://goo.gl/k23F3g) accessed May 2019. \n24 World Bank, 2019b, \u2018GDP at market prices (current US$)\u2019, (http://goo.gl/Bme8GU) accessed May 2019. \n\nhttp://data.worldbank.org/indicator\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 19 \n\nWaste generation data \n\nWaste generation data from Eurostat is updated every two years, the last update including 2016 data \nwhich is available for all EEA-33 countries. The directive 2008/98/EC on waste (25), which first was fully \nimplemented for the 2010 reporting, had significant influence on how waste is reported to EEA. Hence \nfor consistency, only time series from 2010 to 2016 is considered in the profiles. \n \nGVA data for some industry NACE categories and countries are marked as confidential. Hence, gapfilling was performed when needed for the non-industry sectors and then the remaining \u2018industry (no \ndetail)\u2019 sector was calculated based on Total minus all other industry and non-industry sectors. A linear \nextrapolation calculation or a linear interpolation was performed to cover the missing non-industry \ndata. \n \nThe gap-filling procedure was applied to Austria, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland and Sweden. \nA file listing the gap-filled data is available for download. \n \n\nE-PRTR emissions \n\nGap-filling was not performed for the E-PRTR data. Turkey does not report to the E-PRTR. Croatia, an \nEU Member State since 2013, reported for the first time to the E PRTR in 2016, and emission data no \nearlier than 2014 data is available for Croatia. No data were available for Liechtenstein. \n \n\n4 Presentation of data \n\nThis chapter gives a short overview of the data presentation in the Tableau story. The details on how \ndata is extracted and aggregated for presentation is given in Appendix 2. \n\n4.1 Significance of industry  \n\nThis section highlights how important industry is for each country\u2019s economy. The graphs in the \ncountry profiles present information on the size of different industrial sectors in each country in terms \nof GVA, energy consumption and water use. \n \nThe two key parameters for each driver in this section, using energy consumption as the example \nindustrial driver, are \u2018percentage of total energy consumption\u2019 and \u2018percentage of country energy \nconsumption\u2019, as summarised below. \n\nPercentage of total energy consumption in EEA-33 \n\nThis represent the industrial energy consumption per sector compared to the other EEA-33 countries. \n\nPercentage of the country energy consumption \n\nThis represent the share of the industrial energy consumption in the total energy consumption for the \nconcerned country. This provides an overview of the significance of industrial energy consumption \nacross all sectors within the selected country. \n \n\n \n \n25 EC, 2000, Directive 2008/98/EC of 19 November 2008 on waste (replaced by 2018/851/EC). \nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008L0098&from=EN, accessed May 2019. \n\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008L0098&from=EN\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 20 \n\n4.2 Industrial emissions to air and water \n\nSome key parameters are used for all media to provide insights into the state of industrial emissions \nin the EEA countries. \n\nContribution of industry to a country\u2019s total emissions \n\nEmissions from industrial activities are calculated as a percentage of the overall emissions of the \ncountry for each pollutant. For air emissions the country total reflect both industry and non-industry \nsectors, while for water emissions the country total is industry sectors only, due to the availability of \nthe data. This is because the last year water emissions are based on E-PRTR, which is limited in scope \nto industry emissions, while the last year air emissions are based on CLRTAP data which has a broader \nscope. \n\nThe trend in industrial air emissions \n\nThe trend in the industrial emissions per pollutant is calculated as an index relative to the latest year. \nThe trend is based on E-PRTR data and presented for all sectors combined, i.e., one trend line per \npollutant. \n \n\n4.3 Production of waste \n\nAll presentations of waste are given separately for hazardous and non-hazardous waste. \n\nPercentage of total waste generated in EEA-33 \n\nThis represent the waste generated by industry and non-industry per sector compared to the other \nEEA-33 countries.  \n\nPercentage of the country waste per sector \n\nThis represent the share of the industrial and non-industrial waste in the total quantity of waste \ngenerated by the selected country. This provides an overview of the significance of industrial waste \nacross all sectors within the selected country. \n\nThe trend in waste \n\nThe trends in the waste generated are calculated as an index relative to the latest year. The trends are \npresented per industry sector and for the non-industry categories. \n\n5 Closing remarks \n\nThe aim of the country profiles is to provide some insights into the main pressures on environment \nexerted by industrial activities for the EEA member countries and, therefore, contribute to decision \nmaking. In order to get closer to the effect of the industrial emissions, the final pressure from pollutant \nemissions to eco systems and humans has been considered for heavy metals through the USEtox \nfactors. \n \nThe scope of industry includes UWWTP, which may lead to an over-estimation of industrial emissions. \nA reflexion will be conducted for the next revision. \n \nDioxins and furans and PAHs have been added to the list of pollutants considered in the profiles. \nHowever, the data quality is poor for many countries and these pollutants are only presented on an \nEU level. \n \n\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 21 \n\nData on water use is limited for many countries, and the industrial share of water use is only calculated \nfor 17 of the EEA-33 countries. In future versions, some improvements of the data sources will be \nsought. \n \nIndustry is a major contributor to soil contamination in Europe, in many cases via emissions to air. \nThere is a lack of completeness in soil data for countries within the EEA-33, which limits the analysis of \nsoil emission trends (26). The inclusion of emissions data may be developed in future versions of the \ncountry profiles. \n \n\n \n \n26 EEA, 2015, The European environment: state and outlook 2015, European Environment Agency \n\n(http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer) accessed May 2019. \n\nhttp://www.eea.europa.eu/soer\f\n \n\nEionet Report - ETC/ATNI 2019/6 22 \n\n6 References \n\nAMECO, 2018, \u2018Annual macro-economic database: Monetary variables \u2014 exchange rate and \npurchasing power parities interest rates\u2019 \n(http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/ameco/zipped_en.htm) accessed May 2019. \n\nEC, 2000, Directive 2000/60/EC of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action \nin the field of water policy (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32000L0060) \naccessed May 2019. \n\nEC, 2003, Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 \nestablishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and \namending Council Directive 96/61/EC (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32003L0087) accessed May 2019. \n\nEC, 2006, Directive 2006/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on \nthe management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC \u2014 \nStatement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32006L0021) accessed May 2019. \n\nEC, 2008, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 \non waste and repealing certain directives (http://eur\nlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:312:0003:0030:en:PDF) accessed May 2019. \n\nEC, 2010, Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 \non industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (http://eur\nlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:334:0017:0119:en:PDF) accessed May 2019. \n\nEC, 2013, Directive 2013/39/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 \namending Directives 2000/60/EC and 2008/105/EC as regards priority substances in the field of \nwater policy Text with EEA relevance ( https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal\ncontent/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32013L0039) accessed August 2019. \n\nEC, 2013, Regulation No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on \na mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other \ninformation at national and Union level relevant to climate change and repealing Decision No \n280/2004/EC (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32013R0525) accessed May \n2019.  \n\nEEA, 2014, Costs of air pollution from European industrial facilities 2008\u20132012.
