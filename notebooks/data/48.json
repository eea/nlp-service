The current Latvian Natura 2000 network has 333 sites (including seven marine areas); terrestrial Natura 2000 sites occupy 12% or 787,729 ha of the territory of Latvia. Nevertheless, data demonstrate that there is a decreasing connectivity between habitats (EEA, 2015).

The MAES project gives a status of mapping ecosystems, ecosystem services and their values in Denmark. It delivers a mapping of ecosystems in Denmark quantitatively and at digital maps in accordance with the EU MAES Technical report 20123 067. Furthermore it will give a status of the on-going mapping of 16 ecosystem services and biodiversity in accordance with EU MAES technical report 2014 080.Thus an overview of existing data sources and methods used are synthesised in tables where the information regarding data, models and challenges are shown in 4 status categories (smileys). The report shows that there is a large unexploited potential for combining modelling and mapping of ecosystems services and economic valuation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Denmark. Although existing databases and model frameworks have been developed in other contexts than the MAES, they can be modified for use in MAES related analyses. Mapping of the distribution of species shows a clear correlation between land use categories and biodiversity. In cooperation with Danish Universities a follow up MAES project started 2015 and a report has been published in 2017 download\nGreen infrastructure in Denmark:\nBeing a densely populated country, most of the area of Denmark is strategically planned and managed in one way or another.

A clear and all-inclusive strategy on how to achieve these goals (and for what purpose) is still lacking, but it is currently in development.\nGreen infrastructure in Lithuania:\nThe Lithuanian GI strategy is in line with the spatial system developed in the country, called nature frame.

It is bordered by 3 other countries. The highest point is Halti at 1 324m. Finland has a population of 5.5 million people and a population density of 18.1 people per km\u00b2.\nProtected areas\n15175 Protected areas\n13.2% of land\n9.83% of marine waters\nThere are a total of 15175 protected areas in , 1875 Natura 2000 sites - 468 Special Protection Areas (Birds Directive) and 1730 Sites of Community Importance (Habitat Directive) - as well as 13300 sites designated under national laws.\nThe protected area network in Finland is strongly influenced by the interaction between nationally designatedsites and Natura 2000, with 74% of the total area covered by protected areas an overlap between Natura 2000 sites and nationally designated sites.\n4.6% of the network is protected only through national laws\n21.23% of the network consists solely of Natura 2000 sites\n74.17% consist of and overlap between the two.\nThe average size of protected areas in Europe is lower compared to other regions of the world. This largely reflects the high degree of fragmentation of the land in Europe due to urbanisation, infrastructure and general intensification of land use. At a EU level 50% of protected areas have an area of less than 1 km\u00b2.

This internet portal is gradually being developed as a Finnish National CBD Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) under the Convention on Biological Diversity. It aims at synthesizing the knowledge on the status of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and for instance, to serve as the national webpage of Nagoya Protocol on genetic resources and Cartagena Protocol on biosafety. The information processed for this portal is also the basis for national reporting to the CBD. For example, the 5th National report on the implementation of CBD Aichi targets, was compiled with the help of this portal and distributed to the CBD Secretariat in March 2014.\nGreen infrastructure in Finland:\nFinland has no dedicated legislation or policy for GI.\nRelevant legislative framework: The Finnish regulatory system relevant for protection and management of green infrastructure consists of a set of sector specific and integrative instruments (Borgstr\u00f6m and Simil\u00e4 2014). The key mechanisms to protect and manage green infrastructure include protecting areas and habitats, directing the placement and regulating the operation of activities relevant for green infrastructure. These mechanisms are implemented through a number of legislative instruments. The key instruments for the protection of biodiversity, including the Natura 2000 network and habitat protection, can be found in the Nature Conservation Act (1096/1996, latest amended in 2016). The sector specific instruments (e.g. permits and notification systems) include regulations for agriculture, forestry, mining, land extraction and utilization of water resources. The key integrative instrument covering all sectors and activities are the planning law and its implementation mechanism (Land use and Building Act 132/1999) and the environmental impact assessment act (Act on Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure252/2017, Act on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Plans and Programmes on the Environment 200/2005). Also national laws (Act on management of water and marine resources 2004/1299) implementing the EU water framework directive (2000/60/EC) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) are relevant integrative, ecosystem based instruments contributing to the protection of green infrastructure.\nNational Biodiversity strategy for Finland:\nTo report on progress to the EU 2020 biodiversity strategy, the European Commission extracted relevant information from the EU Member States\u2019 5thnational reports to the CBD.
