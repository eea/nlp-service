[{"question": "How does environmental noise pollution impact my health?", "answer": "\n\n\nEnvironmental noise pollution, and in particular road traffic noise, is a growing concern across Europe. Long-term exposure to noise from environmental sources such as road, rail and air transport can cause a variety of health effects including annoyance, sleep disturbance, negative effects on the cardiovascular and metabolic system, as well as cognitive impairment in children. The EEA estimates that environmental noise contributes to 48 000 new cases of ischemic heart disease a year, as well as 12 000 premature deaths. In addition, we estimate that 22 million people suffer chronic high annoyance and 6.5 million people suffer chronic sleep disturbance.\nFor further information, please consult our latest report Environmental noise in Europe \u2014 2020, visit the noise observation and information service in Europe or consult our noise country factsheets.\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/faq/how-does-environmental-noise-pollution or scan the QR code.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/api/SITE/help/faq/how-does-environmental-noise-pollution"}, {"question": "Can the EEA support my company, my research or my project?", "answer": "\n\n\nThe EEA does not engage in marketing and dissemination activities for researchers, nor does it make partnerships with individuals, research centres or private companies.

It is one of the main causes of soil degradation in the EU. Soil sealing often affects fertile agricultural land, puts biodiversity at risk, increases the risk of flooding and water scarcity and contributes to global warming. Since the mid 1950s, the total surface area of cities in the EU has increased by 78 %, thus contributing greatly to soil sealing and its negative impacts.\nThe EEA has developed an interactive data viewer that shows the status of and change in land surface sealing (measured as imperviousness) in Europe for every 3 years between 2006 and 2015. The viewer facilitates the assessment of soil sealing over a specific period, which can be analysed within user defined spatial units such as administrative regions, biogeographical regions or land cover classes.\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/faq/what-is-soil-sealing-and or scan the QR code.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/api/SITE/help/faq/what-is-soil-sealing-and"}, {"question": "Where can I find the latest information on Europe\u2019s forests?", "answer": "\n\n\nThe Forest Information System for Europe (FISE) is an entry point for sharing information with the forest community on Europe\u2019s forest environment, its state and development.

It also takes up large swathes of land and contributes to urban sprawl, the fragmentation of habitats and the sealing of surfaces. Road traffic is responsible for a large part of these adverse impacts. The EU is thus committed to the long-term goal of a decarbonised and non-polluting transport system. Technical solutions and green incentives are an important part of the EU\u2019s strategy to reach this goal. Technological solutions range from the promotion of electric vehicles as alternatives to conventional combustion engine technologies to the promotion of transport fuels from renewable sources. These advances play an important role in reducing emissions to the atmosphere and, thus, in reducing their impacts on climate and air quality. These solutions can also lead to greater independence from fossil fuels and relief from unstable oil prices.

However, our oceans and seas are under threat from over-fishing, sea-floor damage, pollution by nutrient enrichment and contaminants, the spread of non-indigenous species, marine litter and underwater noise. Find out more about these pressures and their cumulative effects on Europe\u2019s Seas in the latest technical report.\nIn addition to implementing a large number of EU marine environment policies and legislation that tackle the above-mentioned pressures, the EU has established marine protected areas. These are geographically distinct zones for which protection objectives exist. The EEA has developed a dedicated briefing on these marine protected areas. A wide collection of marine data is also available through the Marine Information System for Europe (WISE-Marine).\nPlease also consult the EEA report Marine Messages II, especially the chapter on solutions.\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/faq/how-can-we-protect-our or scan the QR code.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/api/SITE/help/faq/how-can-we-protect-our"}, {"question": "What is the share of greenhouse gas emissions per transport mode?", "answer": "\n\n\nThe share of GHG emissions per transport mode is compiled using the national emissions reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to the EU Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Mechanism and is available on the EEA website.\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/faq/what-is-the-share-of or scan the QR code.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/api/SITE/help/faq/what-is-the-share-of"}, {"question": "How effective is urban waste water treatment at reducing water pollution?", "answer": "\n\n\nIt is easy to take water for granted. Clean water comes out of a tap, we use the water and then \u2018dirty\u2019 water disappears down the drain. The collection and treatment of urban waste water is essential to protecting human health and the environment because the water that leaves our homes, schools and workplaces is contaminated by organic matter and nutrients. If released into waterways, these contaminants can make rivers uninhabitable for fish and invertebrates or cause plants and algae to grow excessively.\nThe widespread introduction of effective waste water treatment during the 20th century has greatly improved human health and environmental quality. For most European citizens, waste water is collected, transported and then treated at an urban waste water treatment plant where components that are harmful to the environment and human health are removed, before the water is returned to nature.\nMore information about how waste water treatment works can be found in our briefing Urban waste water treatment for 21st century challenges. Additionally, key indicators on urban waste water treatment in Europe are available, as are maps detailing urban waste water treatment plants, data viewers and a database.

Water quality is influenced by direct inputs, such as from a factory or sewage treatment plant, so-called \u201cpoint source pollution\u201d. It is also influenced by pollution from widespread sources, such as nutrients and pesticides from farming activities and pollutants released by industry into the air which then fall back to land and sea, so-called \u201cdiffuse pollution\u201d. The main point source of pollution to water is from sewage and waste water treatment, while for diffuse pollution, main sources are from farming and fossil fuel power plants (via the air).

Examples of adaptation measures include large-scale infrastructure changes, such as building defenses to protect against sea-level rise, as well behavioral shifts, such as individuals reducing their food waste. In essence, adaptation can be understood as the process of adjusting to the current and future effects of climate change.\nMitigation means making the impacts of climate change less severe by preventing or reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. Mitigation is achieved either by reducing the sources of these gases \u2014 e.g. by increasing the share of renewable energies, or establishing a cleaner mobility system \u2014 or by enhancing the storage of these gases \u2014 e.g. by increasing the size of forests.
