Integrated urban sustainability management can make use of the structure provided by the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets, for a common assessment ground. The present study \npresents a SDG indicator pool sorted along the 17 Goals for all cities to assess their multi-dimensional progress towards sustainability. It has been published on behalf of the European Topic \nCentre on Urban, Land and Soil Systems (ETC-ULS) as an assisting research organ of the European \nEnvironment Agency (EEA).  \n \nSince the adoption of the UN SDGs in 2015 progress has been made but still there is a lot to do \nfor cities and gaps have to be filled. The SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities \npublished by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) in May 2019 states that \nmajor performance (not indicator) gaps persist on environmental goals, especially on SDG 12 \n(Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). \nThe EU and EFTA countries are among those countries that have the highest emission of CO2 per \ncapita in the world. The report also says that, having a look on the cities, all cities have to highly \nimprove their efforts for SDG 13 (Climate Action). Further efforts are needed with regard to \nreducing air pollution in most European cities. The SDSN further writes that most European cities \nare challenged with access to affordable and quality housing. Target 11.1 calls for policymakers \nto ensure access to adequate, safe and affordable housing by 2030. Furthermore, in 2017, the \nEuropean Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless published a report \nemphasising increasing trends in homelessness in cities in Europe. \n \nLet\u2019s start to fill the gaps! This report provides local governments across Europe with a large \nchoice of indicators to display and measure their progress towards the 17 SDGs and their targets. \nRather than offering a fixed set of SDG indicators, the following compilation should be the basis \nfor putting together localised monitoring systems, tailored to local circumstances, challenges \nand data availabilities. \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n5 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nHow to read this report \n \nThis report is the result of the analysis of 2,036 indicators found across 30 indicator sets published by a variety of institutions both on the global, European and national level. All of these \nindicator sets had originally been developed and published for their use at the local, urban level, \nhowever mostly without any reference to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  \nThe authors of this report allocated each of the more than two thousand indicators to one (or \nmore) of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets. Admittedly, this allocation was subjective, however \nthe first result of this allocation showed that for most of the SDGs and their targets, indicators \nfor cities already exist. Even more, after eliminating duplicates, aligning similar indicators and \ncleaning up inconsistencies in indicator titles and measurement, the choice of existing indicators \neven allowed for splitting them down into different aspects of one target.  \n \nThe result is a compilation of existing indicators developed for cities and local governments, \nstructured along the 17 SDGs, each of their 169 targets, and a variety of aspects of these targets. \nDifferent from other publications on the same topic, this report does not identify any new SDG \nindicators for cities, nor does it promote a specific set of indicators to monitor progress in \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals on the local level. It also doesn\u2019t measure or analyse any of these indicators.  \n \nThe report serves as a pool of potential indicators local governments can choose from when \ndeveloping their own, individual SDG monitoring system. This way, specific local aspects of each \ngoal and target can be reflected. Local policy priorities can be taken into account and linked to \nthe SDGs through an integrated local monitoring system. And finally, indicators can be selected \naccording to their data availability.  \n \n\nStructure of each chapter \n\nFollowing the structure of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, this report has 17 chapters \u2013 \none for each SDG. Each chapter starts with a brief introduction to the respective SDG and its \nrelevance at the local level. An overview analysis shows how many of the indicators found could \nbe allocated to which of the SDG\u2019s targets. It also highlights gaps as well as such targets for which \na particular wealth of potential indicators exists. The largest part of each chapter lists all indicators allocated to the respective SDG, split down by targets and, where applicable, particular aspects of each target. For each indicator, a dedicated title, its unit of measurement and its source \n(i.e. the indicator set it has been taken from) are displayed. For some indicators, the unit of \nmeasurement is simply the existence or non-existence of a particular feature, indicated as \n\u2018yes/no\u2019 in the tables. For some other indicators, no unit of measurement could be identified.  \n \nFor some of the SDG targets, no indicators could be allocated. This shows that there is still room \nfor improvement on the way towards integrated local monitoring systems for measuring progress towards achieving the SDGs. However, it also shows that cities and local governments cannot implement the SDGs alone. Some issues are better addressed and monitored at the national \nlevel, and a multilevel approach to achieving the goals is needed.\n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n6 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\n  \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n7 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\n \n \n55 per cent of the world\u2019s population have no access to social \nprotection. That\u2019s why poverty will remain one of the main issues within the next decades. Poverty means not only the absence of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood. For the people being poor it also means hunger and \nmalnutrition, limited or no access to education and other \nbasic services, social discrimination and exclusion and often \nalso the lack of participation in decision-making. That\u2019s why \nan inclusive economic growth is needed that provides sustainable jobs and promotes equality. Social protection systems \nwill help coping with the above mentioned challenges, because they help afflicted populations in case of unexpected \neconomic losses during disasters and they guarantee a minimum supply for the poorest. \n\nRelevance for cities and local governments \n\nCities offer a great scope of job opportunities, they can increase living standards and empower people to make decisions about their lives. Challenges for the cities are the inefficient and often unequal land use and housing markets, lack of \naccess to basic services and existing socio-economic traps. Local governments have the chance to identify those that live in \npoverty. They can target resources and services directly to \nthem to help them getting out of it. They can target urban \nhousing, planning and architectural design that affects the \ncreation and distribution of wealth both in newly built and already existing high-risk urban neighborhoods. Elementary is \nthe strengthening of inclusive education to enhance employability.\n\nEND POVERTY  \nIN ALL ITS \nFORMS            \nEVERYWHERE \n\f\n \n \nSDG 1 \n \n\n8 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 1 l Overview \n \nThe 45 indicators found for SDG 1 show a significant focus on target 1.2 (poverty reduction in all \nits dimensions), dealing with the national poverty line, the household financial situation and \npoverty risk.  \n \nTarget 1.4 (access to economic resources, services, ownership) can also be measured by many \nindicators dealing with housing, such as access to property, affordability of housing and subsidies. Nonetheless, the target is not entirely covered, as there is no indicator dealing with access \nto microfinance for instance. \n \nThe other targets, 1.5. (build resilience), 1.3 (implement social protection systems), 1.a (resources allocated to end poverty) are covered with lower number of indicators. However, the \nindicators found are highly relevant for their corresponding target. \n \nIn contrast target 1.b (pro-poor and gender-sensitive policy frameworks) has no indicator as the \ntarget is not applicable at the local level (but at the regional, national and international level). \nTarget 1.1 (eradicate extreme poverty), measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day, is \nrepresented only by one indicator, which reflects its comparably low relevance for European \ncities. \n \nIn conclusion, most relevant targets of SDG 1 from an urban perspective are well covered with \na good choice of potential indicators. \n \nFigure 1: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 1 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people\neverywhere, currently measured as people living on\u2026\n\n1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of\nmen, women and children of all ages living in\u2026\n\n1.3  Implement nationally appropriate social\nprotection systems and measures for all, including\u2026\n\n1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in\nparticular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal\u2026\n\n1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those\nin vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure\u2026\n\n1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a\nvariety of sources, including through enhanced\u2026\n\n1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national,\nregional and international levels, based on pro-poor\u2026\n\nSDG 1 - No Poverty\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n9 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 1 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget 1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nCity population living below the international poverty line % 6 \n\nTarget 1.2.

As more and more land is populated and soil is \nsealed, farmers have to produce food for a growing population on less agricultural land. Climate change and air pollution increase negative effects on food production - soils, \nfreshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are more and \nmore degraded. Together, all of this puts pressure on the resources humankind depends on, the danger of disasters like \ndroughts and floods is increasing. Fast food finds its way into \ndaily life \u2013 frequently implying malnutrition and other health \nissues like diabetes or overweight.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nImplementing sustainable agricultural practices can help ensure future food security, depending on increased investment in rural infrastructure and agricultural research. But \nalso cities and local governments have to contribute. They \ncan set an example of healthy and regional food supply: In \npublic institutions like kindergartens, schools, hospitals etc. \nthe provision of food can happen in cooperation with local \nsuppliers and farmers. Local initiatives like nutrition councils \ncan be supported and of course responsibility doesn\u2019t end at \nthe city-border. Buying fair trade products in the frame of \npublic procurement is one possibility to think outside the \nbox. Malnutrition and obesity can be faced with public information services, special public training courses or collaborations with sports associations. The waste of food should be \navoided. \n  \n\nEND HUNGER, \nACHIEVE FOOD \nSECURITY AND \nIMPROVED    \nNUTRITION \n\f\n \n \nSDG 2 \n \n\n16 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 2 l Overview  \n \nAmong the 122 indicators found for SDG 2, the majority was allocated to target 2.4 (ensure \nsustainable food systems), covering topics such as land use, city self-sufficiency, volume of food \nproduction, eco-practices, eco-policies, circular economy and \u201cfood print\u201d.  \n \nIndicators of target 2.3 (double productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers) address \naspects such as access to land, job creation, farmers\u2019 income and access to financial services, \ntraining and local market opportunities via supply/value chains and procurement contracts.  \n \nTarget 2.1 (ensure food access by all) can count on a variety of indicators addressing aspects of \nfood security, vulnerability and accessibility. Agri-prosumerism indicators were also included \nhere with the idea that urban agriculture can contribute to lower food vulnerability. \n \nTarget 2.2 (end all form of malnutrition) gathers a good amount of indicators dealing with general and children malnutrition (undernourishment and over-nourishment), as well as household \nfood baskets.  \n \nIn contrast, targets 2.5 to 2.c have a very low or inexistent coverage by indicators. This may \nreflect their more national-level oriented topics. Indeed, indicators found for these targets explicitly refer to national and international responsibilities.  \n \nThe biggest contribution to this SDG is the RUAF Indicator Framework, especially developed for \nCity Region Food Systems \u2013 thus most indicators are applicable to the urban context.

Within the last ten years significant improvements \nhave been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing \nchild and maternal mortality as well as HIV infections. Still, \nmore than six million children die before getting 5 years old \nevery year. In our modern society people are getting older than \never before. Their wellbeing and health care has to be guaranteed. Also further, new health related issues have to be taken \ninto account, such as substance abuse, traffic accidents, air- \nand water-borne pollution as well as bacterial and virus pandemics.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nCities and their local governments can play a decisive role with \nregard to the health and well-being of their inhabitants. Proper \nhousing and sanitation, access to food, health and medical facilities have a great influence on the well-being of people. Furthermore, air quality and access to green spaces like parks, gardens, sports fields as well as swimming pools or camping \ngrounds play an important role. To improve the air that people \nbreathe sustainable urban mobility is a key issue in terms of \naccessible public transport or safe walking and cycling paths. \nAs access to addictive substances like tobacco, alcohol and \ndrugs is easier in cities than in rural areas substance abuse is \nmore common \u2013 and thus a challenge for the cities to take care \nof. Family and other social bonds tend to be less strong in cities, that\u2019s why it is important to build substitute structures especially with a view to elderly people who have no family to \ncare for them. \n \n\nENSURE \nHEALTHY LIVES \nAND  PROMOTE \nWELL-BEING FOR \nALL AT ALL AGES \n\f\n \n \nSDG 3 \n\n30  ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 3 l Overview \n \n\nThe 127 indicators found for SDG 3 show a predominant concentration on targets 3.4 (preventing non-communicable diseases) and 3.9 (environmental pollution impacting human health). \nHere target 3.4, particularly reflects on the aspects of life expectancy, general and specific mortality rates, food safety, diet and habits influencing health and linked policies and diseases. For \ntarget 3.9, there is a considerable amount of indicators related to hazardous chemicals and air \nquality, as well as pollution from agriculture, electromagnetic fields, noise and light. Indicators \ntypically assess and monitor either levels of pollution, the population exposure or the existence \nof policies addressing these environmental issues. \n \nTargets 3.8 (universal health coverage) and 3.6 (road traffic injuries and deaths) are well represented by indicators showing high relevance for the corresponding targets. Targets 3.1 (maternal mortality) and 3.2 (child mortality) see fewer indicators, which however reflects the specificy \nof the phenomena they address. \n \nIn contrast, targets 3.3 (AIDS and other communicable diseases), 3.5 (substance abuse such as \ntobacco and other drugs), 3.7 (family planning), 3.b (research for vaccines and medicines), show \ninsufficient coverage by indicators. These gaps may be explained by the fact that related data \nare typically processed at the national level. They may however also indicate a lower level of \npriority of these targets at the local level. \n \nTarget 3.a (WHO convention on tobacco control) has no corresponding local indicators as it represents rules that govern the production, sale, distribution, advertisement, and taxation of tobacco, which are typically decided upon at national and international level. \n \nIn the case of target 3.c (health financing and workforce in developing countries) not a single \nindicator could be identified across the indicator sets. This can be explained by the target\u2019s focus \non developing, least-developed countries and small islands \u2013 which does not resonate directly \nwith European local governments\u2019 concerns. \n \nTarget 3.d (risk reduction and management of global health risks) surprisingly shows only one \nindicator that could be used to address pandemics coming from industrial animal farming locally. \nThere seems to be a serious gap that should be filled with more specific indicators on bacterial \nand virus risks.  \n \nA large amount of the indicator sets included in this study address this SDG, such as The EU \nGreen City Tool, City Prosperity Index, \u201cFirst generation of EU Common Indicators: Towards a \nLocal Sustainability Profile\u201d and others. In terms of measurement units, the majority of indicators are quantitative, however some qualitative ones particularly address the satisfaction of the \npopulation with health services. \n \n  \n\f\n

It\u2019s a key instrument to tackle poverty and develop instruments and strategies to achieve progress in all aspects of sustainable development. Education is still affected by a number of existing and \nalso growing socio-economic inequalities like gender, race, income - and age. Education doesn\u2019t stop in adolescence, adult \neducation is an important issue. Train the trainers - also the \nteachers have to be taken into account. The reasons for lack of \nquality education are often due to a lack of adequately trained \nteachers or even poor conditions of schools and equity issues \ne.g. concerning rural children.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nQuality education and urban development are closely connected. Cities have always been centres of knowledge creation \nand innovation. National education systems as well as culture \noften depend on progress made in cities \u2013 they act as forerunners. Still many cities do not provide inclusive and equitable \neducation and thus socio-economic inequalities are growing. \nPrimary level education is a direct responsibility of local governments in most countries. Education governance therefore \nneeds to be improved regarding inclusion, accountability and \nquality, and training programmes should be included in local \neconomic development strategies. A further possibility is the \nsupport of cooperation between different schools but also research institutions and local businesses. Lifelong learning \nshould be supported and offered. \n  \n\nENSURE             \nINCLUSIVE AND \nEQUITABLE \nQUALITY          \nEDUCATION \nAND PROMOTE \nLIFELONG \nLEARNING  \nOPPORTUNITIES \nFOR ALL. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 4 \n \n\n46 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 4 l Overview \n \n\n80 indicators are allocated to SDG 4 in a relatively balanced manner, although there is a slight \nfocus on target 4.a (education facilities). Target 4.a has been interpreted here in a broad sense, \nincluding the existence and quality of facilities (buildings and material), their integration in urban planning and resource consumption (e.g. water, energy), green procurement practices, the \nstimulating learning conditions their offer, and the presence of public libraries in the city. \n \nTarget 4.3 is the second most represented target with indicators addressing aspects such as \nyouth enrolment and expenditures for different levels of education, especially the post-secondary one (including universities). The phenomenon of early leavers was recurring in various indicator sets. \n \nTarget 4.5 (disparities and access to education) is covered by more general indicators as well as \nmore specific ones on gender and vulnerable sub-groups, such as learners with special needs. \nSchool feeding programmes were integrated here as the performance of the students at school \ncan be unfairly influenced by lifestyles at home (depending on their socio-economic status). \n \nTargets 4.7, 4.4, 4.1 are addressed by modest but sufficient numbers of indicators.

Still, women and girls \nare often more affected than men and boys by poverty, food \ninsecurity and environmental pollution. SDG 5 aims at ending \ndiscrimination and violence against women and girls as well as \nensuring that they have equal opportunities in life that boys \nand men already have. At the current time, 1 in 5 women and \ngirls between the ages of 15-49 have reported experiencing \nphysical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12month period and 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence (UN 2019).  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nGrowing cities imply opportunities for social, economic, cultural and political participation that facilitate gender empowerment. Still not only gender, race, ethnicity or age, but also \ninherited income and status are discriminatory grounds for \nwomen and girls in cities \u2013 especially manifested in illegal settlements where levels of vulnerability disproportionately affect \nwomen, youth and children. Cities can address such cross-cutting issues in order to have direct impact on breaking these circles of social exclusion. Local governments need to set a good \nexample through non-discriminatory service provision to citizens and fair employment practices. Getting more female leaders in local governments empowers women but also challenges \ngender stereotypes and sets an example to young girls. Targeting maternity and childcare benefits, as well as workforce integration trainings would be a further possibility.  \n\nACHIEVE       \nGENDER \nEQUALITY AND \nEMPOWER ALL \nWOMEN AND \nGIRLS. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 5 \n \n\n58 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 5 l Overview \n \nFor SDG 5, 33 indicators were found and could be allocated among half of the targets.

This is the case for the targets 5.3 \n(elimination of harmful practices), 5.6 (reproductive rights), 5.a (ownership by women), and 5.b \n(empowerment by technology).

This requires the \nurgent need of a better management of water and sanitation \nto guarantee human wellbeing, while preserving the resilience \nof the ecosystem. At the current time, more than 2 billion people are living with the risk of reduced access to freshwater resources and by 2050, at least one in four people is likely to live \nin a country affected by chronic or recurring shortages of fresh \nwater. Good water quality is not only a matter of the so called \ndeveloping countries \u2013 also in Europe a lot of people prefer \nbuying water in bottles than drinking the water that comes out \nof their taps. Bottles that often are made out of plastic \u2013 and \nmean a high waste volume.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nDue to freshwater lakes, rivers and underground water sources \nwater supply seems to be unlimited in Europe. But environmental pollution, negative impacts of climate change as well as \npopulation growth and the increasing urbanisation have a \nhighly negative impact on the water supply and its quality \u2013 \nmaking it a challenge especially for cities.  Only 20% of the water provided by public water supply is really used. The other \n80% go back to the environment primarily as treated \nwastewater. Sealed and concreted surfaces cause that rain water flows into the waste water system \u2013 instead of feeding the \naquifers. If cities change their water supply systems they can \nreuse the so called grey water, such as water from taps, showers and the kitchen. It can be reused, for example, for toilet \nflushing.   \n\nENSURE    \nAVAILABILITY \nAND                \nSUSTAINABLE \nMANAGEMENT \nOF WATER AND \nSANITATION \nFOR ALL. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 6 \n \n\n64 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 6 l Overview \n \n\n59 indicators were identified to potentially monitor progress towards SDG 6 locally. Targets 6.4 \n(water use efficiency) and 6.3 (wastewater reduction) have most of the indicators allocated.  \nProper water management strategies or policies help reduce fresh water consumption as well \nas the amount of treated water. Target 6.4 gathers indicators dealing with water use efficiency, \nwater use reduction, sustainable withdrawal and stormwater management. Indicators for target \n6.3 focus on wastewater treatment capacity, the quality of treatment, and how well the population is connected to it. They also address nutrient and nitrogen recovery and ground water \nquality. Target 6.2 (sanitation) is linked to 6.3 but only one indicator was found that specifically \ncovers that target well. \n \nTarget 6.6 (water-related ecosystems) is strongly linked to target 15.1 (freshwater ecosystems). \nTarget 6.1 (access to water) refers specifically to drinking water, its quality, costs and irregularities in supply, as well as specific sector consumption. \n \nIn contrast, target 6.5 (transboundary water management) is poorly represented and for target \n6.b (local communities support) not a single indicator could be allocated, although both targets \ncould be considered important and relevant for the local level.  \n \nTarget 6.a (international cooperation and capacity building) has no indicators allocated either, \nhowever this gap seems justifiable with the international dimension of this target. \n \nFigure 6: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 6 \n\n   \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to\nsafe and affordable drinking water for all\n\n6.2\u00a0By 2030, achieve access to adequate and\nequitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end\u2026\n\n6.3\u00a0By 2030, improve water quality by reducing\npollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing\u2026\n\n6.4\u00a0By 2030, substantially increase water-use\nefficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable\u2026\n\n6.5\u00a0By 2030, implement integrated water resources\nmanagement at all levels, including through\u2026\n\n6.6\u00a0By 2020, protect and restore water-related\necosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands,\u2026\n\n6.a\u00a0By 2030, expand international cooperation and\ncapacity-building support to developing countries in\u2026\n\n6.b\u00a0Support and strengthen the participation of local\ncommunities in improving water and sanitation\u2026\n\nSDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 6 \n \n\n65 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 6 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  6.1  By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all  \n\nGeneral access \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nDoes your city collect (or have access to) good data on drinking water consumption by: \n- Private homes / households? \n- Businesses/industry? \n- Public services (i.e. schools, hospitals, municipal buildings etc.) \n\nyes/no 14 \n\nPopulation connected to potable drinking water system % 10 \n\nTotal drinking water consumption m\u00b3/year 13 \n\nMedian price paid per 1000 litres of water in euros, at the time of year when \nwater is most expensive \n\nEUR/1 000 litres \n\n1 \n\nHow many days of non-compliance with the Drinking Water Directive?

That\u2019s why access to energy for \nall is essential. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes. As the global energy supply still \nconsists for about 81.3% of - finite - fossil fuels, the transition \nto renewable energy is the main intention of SDG 7:  Using the \ndiversity of resources, combined with modern energy efficient \ntechnologies that address climate change mitigation, efficient \nenergy generation and demand, and resilient energy infrastructure. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nIn cities, most energy is consumed in the building, transport, \nwater and waste sectors - with greenhouse gas emissions released due to burning fossil fuels. According to their geographical conditions as well as their design and planning cities have \nto move towards more decentralized and smart systems. Even \nif energy is often provided by private sector or national agencies, local governments can accelerate the local sustainable energy transition. They can provide leadership, guidance and regulations to support the energy transition. They can also develop or redesign energy efficient buildings. Another important \ntool is eco-mobility that reduces energy consumption and \nswitches to clean fuels. Cities can encourage the use of renewables in procurement practices and in regulations for energy \nuse by homeowners, public services, and if possible private \nbusinesses. Last but not least providing financial incentives like \ncongestion charges or tax discounts for the use of green energy \nis another helpful way to encourage change.  \n\nENSURE           \nACCESS TO       \nAFFORDABLE, \nRELIABLE,      \nSUSTAINABLE \nAND MODERN \nENERGY FOR \nALL. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 7 \n \n\n74 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 7 l Overview \n \n\nMost indicators found for SDG 7 could be allocated to target 7.2 (share of renewable energy), \nincluding also aspects such as residential and public energy consumption, as well as local policies \nfor cleaner and more efficient energy production. \n \nA considerable amount of indicators could also be found for target 7.3 (energy efficiency), \nmainly addressing aspects such as energy consumption, the availability of energy efficiency \nplans, and energy efficiency of buildings.  \n \nIndicators identified for target 7.1 (energy access) cover topics such as affordability, reliability \nand modernity of energy services. \n \nTargets 7.a (international co-operation) and 7.b (support modern energy infrastructure in least \ndeveloped countries) are hardly represented by indicators here, however this could have been \nexpected as they explicitly address global policy issues going far beyond city boarders. \n \nIn summary it can be said that those targets of SDG 7 most relevant for European local governments can be monitored sufficiently.  \n \n\nFigure 7: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 7 \n\n \n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n7.1  By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable,\nreliable and modern energy services\n\n7.2  By 2030, increase substantially the share of\nrenewable energy in the global energy mix\n\n7. 3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement\nin energy efficiency\n\n7.a  By 2030, enhance international cooperation to\nfacilitate access to clean energy research and\u2026\n\n7.B  By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade\ntechnology for supplying modern and sustainable\u2026\n\nSDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 7 \n \n\n75 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 7 l Indicators \n\nTarget  7.1  By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services \n\nAffordable energy \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nPopulation with access to electricity % 1, 4, 6, \n7 \n\nPercentage of electricity customers with demand response capabilities % 7 \n\nHas your city made projections of future developments in energy supply and \ndemand?

The more important is it to develop and design \nit in a prospective and sustainable way. This requires societies \nto create the conditions that stimulate sustainable business \ndevelopment and job creation, while at the same time not \nharming the environment. These job opportunities and working conditions have to be provided for all, thus for the whole \nworking age population. This comprises a major challenge for \nthe whole development agenda. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nNearly 80 percent of the Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \nis generated by and in cities. They are centers of economic production and consumption activities, commerce and money distribution. There is a direct relationship between urbanisation \nand sustainable economic and social development: Countries \nwith the highest per capita income are usually more urbanised \nwhereas low-income countries are often less urbanised. Thus \nsustainable economic growth of a country highly depends on \nthe sustainable development of its cities - they need new and \ninclusive economic models in cities. Local governments can \nstimulate and support responsible local businesses that keep \nmoney in the community and provide jobs. Enhancing highquality education is the basis to develop a skilled workforce \nand fight poverty, also addressing youth unemployment challenges. With view to their global responsibility local governments can support sustainable and fair trade procurement. \n \n  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 8 \n \n\n82 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 8 l Overview \n \n\nFor SDG 8, a total of 108 indicators could be allocated, showing a predominating focus on targets \n8.5 (full employment and decent work for all) across the indicator sets screened. This target \naddresses aspects such as disparities in employment and income, as well as the type of employment (part-time, temporary, instability), the role of the informal sector, the presence of \u2018working poor\u2019, and the overall satisfaction with the labor market. Many of the indicators found were \nvariations of employment and unemployment rates and have been merged. \n \nThe second most addressed target is 8.2 (economic productivity), covering topics such as innovation, high-tech workforce, economic specialisation and density. It is followed by target 8.3 (job \ncreation), mirrored by indicators on business and green job creation. Target 8.9 (sustainable \ntourism) addresses issues such as cultural heritage and the tourism sector in general, with a view \non further job creation. \n \nTarget 8.1 (GDP) finds a broad offer of GDP-based or GDP-oriented indicators. Although questioned more and more widely over the past years, GDP growth seems to remain the number \none indicator of a successful, healthy economy and society. Other societal progress indicators \nmay be needed to measure SDG 8 \u201cbeyond GDP\u201d.  \n \nTarget 8.4 (decouple environmental degradation from economic growth) already leads the way \ninto this narrative, supported by indicators on public and private engagement.

Sustainable investments in infrastructure like transport, \nirrigation, energy and information and communication technology are thus crucial for achieving sustainable development. \nThe technological progress is also important to achieve environmental objectives, such as increased resource and energyefficiency. Without technology and innovation, industrialisation will not happen, and without industrialisation, development will not happen.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nInfrastructure and technological and social innovation are \nhighly related to the city and spatial planning. Often there is a \ncoexistence of different areas in cities: Those that are well developed and those that are less developed with inadequate \nhousing, scarce services, and deficient mobility and logistical \nnetworks. The role of local governments is quite complex, \noverseeing the interconnected urban systems, services and \nflows related to local production and consumption (e.g. waste \nmanagement, energy supply, water and sanitation, transportation). For a prosperous development of a city it is important to \nsupport also \u201cthe little ones\u201d, thus integrating small-scale industries and start-ups into local economic development strategies. To increase the resilience of a city a mix of green, blue \nand gray infrastructure is needed. This means also an increasing sustainability of infrastructure, buildings and industry \nthrough cradle-to-cradle construction (full life cycle planning).  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 9 \n \n\n96 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 9 l Overview \n \n\nThis SDG is mirrored by 62 different indicators with an unbalanced distribution among its targets. With 40 indicators allocated to it, target 9.1 (infrastructure) represents the key target of \nSDG 9. Aspects addressed include regional collaboration, transport infrastructure in general and \nmore specifically public and soft mobility modes. Electric mobility, water infrastructure and food \ninfrastructure are also integrated here although more indicators can be found in related topic \nspecific targets under other SDGs (SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 11). Phone and internet networks are \nimportant indicators here, but can also be found under SDG 17. \n \nTarget 9.2 (industrialization) comes far behind as the second most addressed target of this SDG. \nIts indicators focus on green jobs, innovative businesses and skill training. Target 9.5 (technological capabilities) refers to monitoring the number of researchers and the financial resources \nspent on research in relation to local GDP. \n \nTargets 9.3 (increase access to financial services) and 9.4. (retrofit industries to resource-use \nefficiency and clean technologies) are addressed by a few indicators only and could clearly benefit from an identification of some more relevant ones. \n \nTargets 9.a (facilitate resilient infrastructure development in developing countries), 9.b (support \ndomestic research and development in developing countries), and 9.c (access to information \nand communication technologies in least developed countries) all refer to measures targeted to \ndeveloping and least developed countries, which explains the absence of indicators found to \nassess them in European cities. \n \nIn summary, the choice of indicators found in the sets screened for this study appears too small \nto assess and monitor SDG 9 and improve infrastructure and industry at the local level.  \n \nFigure 9: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 9 \n\n \n \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n9.1  Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and\u2026\n\n9.2  Promote inclusive and sustainable \u2026\n\n9.3  Increase the access of small-scale industrial and\u2026\n\n9.4  By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit\u2026\n\n9.5  Enhance scientific research, upgrade the\u2026\n\n9.a  Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure\u2026\n\n9.b  Support domestic technology development,\u2026\n\n9.c  Significantly increase access to information and\u2026\n\nSDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 9 \n \n\n97 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 9 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  9.1  Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, \nincluding regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic \ndevelopment and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all \n\nAspect  Regional collaboration \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nDoes your city cooperate with other authorities at different levels or other \norganisations (regional, national, EU, international) on environmental and \nsustainability issues? \n\nyes/no 13 \n\nIn your transport planning processes, do you systematically involve: \n- all city departments that might have an interest in how the transport systems functions, including transport; land-use and spatial planning; social services; energy; health; education; enforcement and policing? \n- neighbouring urban areas? \n- neighbouring rural areas? \n- different levels of administration and government?

This means sustainable development and making the planet better for all \nwon\u2019t be possible if people are excluded from opportunities, \nservices, and the chance for a better life. Despite progress in \nsome areas, income inequality continues to rise in many parts \nof the world. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nToday, cities generate nearly 80 percent of the global GDP. But \nthey also have the highest economic gaps between people. \nMost inequalities happen to be a result of different combined \nfactors such as weak economic development and planning as \nwell as rapid and uncontrolled processes of urbanisation. To \nmanage these processes well is the challenge for cities and \ntheir governments. Otherwise, economic gaps and social fragmentation will grow. In practice this means to provide equal \naccess to urban services, strengthen governance by promoting \naccountability and fighting corruption, institutional and financial support for the most deprived areas, provide information \non how to recover from disasters and poverty traps and support sustainable business ethics \u2013 not only with a view to the \nlocal and regional economy but also globally: How can a city \nreduce inequality in foreign countries?

Indicators display different aspects of inclusion, spanning from \nsocial, economic and political to cultural inclusion. \n \nTarget 10.4 (social protection policies) is also well covered with a focus on housing subsidies and \nsocial aid. Target 10.1 (income growth) is mainly mirrored by indicators on income levels and \ninequalities. Indicators from SDG 1 could be used to complete these targets when/if needed. \n \nTarget 10.3 (equal opportunity) showcases indicators dealing with care and education, linking \nup to gender equality and upward mobility. Target 10.7 (migration policies) is addressed by a \nlow number of indicators, however they may be sufficient to assess and monitor this target \nthanks to the good balance between qualitative and quantitative indicators. \n \nOut of ten, the remaining five targets are hardly addressed by any indicators at all. This may \nmainly be due to the fact that these targets are about global policy issues and go far beyond city \nboarders. \n \nMost SDG 10 targets are tightly intertwined with SDG 1, and only few of those targets related \nto global or national policies and measures can be handled by local policies.  \n \n\nFigure 10: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 10 \n\n \n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n10.1\u00a0By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain\nincome growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the\u2026\n\n10.2\u00a0By 2030, empower and promote the social,\neconomic and political inclusion of all, irrespective\u2026\n\n10.3\u00a0Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities\nof outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory\u2026\n\n10.4\u00a0Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social\nprotection policies, and progressively achieve\u2026\n\n10.5\u00a0Improve the regulation and monitoring of global\nfinancial markets and institutions and strengthen\u2026\n\n10.6\u00a0Ensure enhanced representation and voice for\ndeveloping countries in decision-making in global\u2026\n\n10.7\u00a0Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible\nmigration and mobility of people, including through\u2026\n\n10.A\u00a0Implement the principle of special and\ndifferential treatment for developing countries, in\u2026\n\n10.B\u00a0Encourage official development assistance and\nfinancial flows, including foreign direct investment,\u2026\n\n10.C\u00a0By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the\ntransaction costs of migrant remittances and\u2026\n\nSDG 10 - Reduced inequalities\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 10 \n \n\n107 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 10 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  10.1  By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the \nbottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national \naverage \n\nAspect  Income levels \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nFamily income and size EUR/# 25 \n\nLow income household % 16 \n\nMid-level income households: Share of households with an annual income \nbetween 25.000 and 50.000 EUR \n\n% 23 \n\nHigh income households: Share of households with more than 50.000 EUR \nannual income \n\n% 23 \n\n \n\nAspect  Income inequalities \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nGini Coefficient  Coefficient  \n(1-100) \n\n4, 7, 8, \n28, 30 \n\nIncome inequalities Ratio 8 , 21 , \n25 \n\nDemonstrate that income inequality in the region and locally is decreasing \nover time \n\nyes/no 24 \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 10 \n \n\n108 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nTarget  10.2  By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political \ninclusion of all, irrespective  \nof age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or \nother status \n\nAspect  Social inclusion \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nPeople at risk of poverty or social exclusion % 2, 8, \n17, 25, \n29, 30 \n\nPercentage of local budget dedicated to Deprived Neighbourhoods Areas \ncompared to global local budget % 8 \n\nDemonstrate that at least 80% of residents report positive levels of neighborhood cohesion through community surveys \nOR Demonstrate an increased percentage of residents reporting positive \nlevels of neighborhood cohesion through community surveys \n\nyes/no 24 \n\nDemonstrate that 70% or more of surveyed seniors view the community as \nmeeting their needs \n\nyes/no 24 \n\nDemonstrate the following challenges to seniors living independently are \nless than the national values for: \n\u2022 Responsibility for grandchildren;

Over 3.5 billion people live in cities today and in future even more people \nwill live there: By 2030, almost 75 percent of the world\u2019s population will be urban habitants. Cities are responsible for up to \n80 percent of overall energy use and 75 percent of greenhouse \ngas emissions \u2013 their impact is quite big! \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nSDG 11 explicitly refers to cities. Common urban challenges include traffic, lack of funds to provide basic services, a shortage \nof adequate housing, declining infrastructure and rising air pollution within cities. Local governments can support integrated \nand sustainable urban planning and management. It\u2019s in their \nresponsibility to ensure that housing services are affordable, \nadequate and safe. Low carbon development strategies, sustainable waste management and closed material cycles reduce \nenvironmental impacts and the resource foot-prints of cities. \nIn this regard sustainable urban mobility and inclusive public \ntransport systems play an important role. To increase the living \nquality in cities it\u2019s important to provide access to green and \npublic spaces for all. Not only the city itself plays an important \nrole \u2013 it is highly connected to peri-urban and rural areas and \nthus should support positive economic, social and environmental links between those areas. Strategic partnerships with businesses as well as green public procurement can foster sustainable local economies and technological development.  \n\n  \n\nMAKE CITIES \nAND HUMAN \nSETTLEMENTS \nINCLUSIVE, \nSAFE,                  \nRESILIENT AND \nSUSTAINABLE. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 11 \n \n\n114 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 11 l Overview \n \nNot unexpectedly, a total of 389 different indicators could be allocated to SDG 11. Their distribution shows a focus on target 11.2 (transport systems) that mainly deals with transport modes \nand public transport. It addresses aspects such as existing transport planning policies and targets, and green transport (e.g. electric vehicles, low emissions public transport fleet).  \n \nTarget 11.3 (inclusive and sustainable urbanisation) is the second most represented target and \nincludes aspects such as land use, city planning, urban sprawl and citizen participation. There \nare fewer indicators for sustainable urbanisation, e.g. compactness or land recycling. \n \nTarget 11.6 (environmental impact of cities) is displayed by indicators focusing on three topics \nregulated by European Commission Directives: Air quality (levels of pollutants and exceedance), \nnoise (people exposed to high levels of noise) and waste (solid waste and hazardous waste). This \ntarget overlaps strongly with SDG 3 and SDG 12. \n \nTarget 11.7 (access to green public space) is addressed by indicators on public open spaces, \ngreen areas and parks (with a wide range of metrics), as well as urban blue areas, presence of \ntrees and the perception by local residents. \n \nTarget 11.1 (access to adequate housing and basic services) is strongly focused on quality and \naffordability of housing conditions, including living space, informal housing, evictions and homeless people, housing costs, social housing and subsidies. Accessibility to basic services and food \nis also addressed. \n \nTarget 11.4 (cultural heritage) gathers indicators on the presence of historic cultural and natural \nvalue found in the city and their related preservation policies. It also proposes indicators on the \nliving culture and recreation possibilities. \n \nTarget 11.5 (human and economic impacts of disasters) is mirrored by indicators on related human and economic loss, vulnerability to general environmental disasters and more specifically \nto floods. It also provides important indicators on the response to emergencies from the public \nservices. Target 11.b (adaptation to, and mitigation of climate change) goes in the continuity of \nthis target as it casts indicators on knowledge of climate change impact and risks, disaster preparedness and resilience, water-related disasters management and respect to code standards \nto diminish buildings vulnerability. \n \nTarget 11.a (regional development planning) compiles a few indicators on urban-urban linkages, \nincluding the topic of green infrastructure. \n \nThe only target without any indicator allocated is target 11.c (support use of local material in \nleast developed countries), which can be explained by the international dimension of this target \n\u2013 outside of the scope of a European local government. \n \nIn summary, there is a good, even overwhelming, coverage of SDG 11 targets with potential \nindicators. This doesn\u2019t surprise too much, as this SDG explicitly addresses cities. In order to \nassess and further monitor the progress made towards this goal, a thorough selection of the \nmost relevant indicators is recommended. \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 11 \n\n \n\n115 ETC/ULS Report |

If human society continues to de\nvelop at its current pace, it is estimated that global resource \n\nuse will quadruple within the next two decades. Thus sustaina\nble consumption and production is key to promoting resource \n\nand energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing \n\naccess to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better \n\nquality of life for all.  \n\n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nCities as public authorities can play a key role and set a good \nexample: They are large buyers and thus have a certain market \npower. The increasing urbanisation will cause also increasing \nconsumption of energy, land and water. The purchasing decisions cities make can help influencing the development of new, \nmore sustainable products and services. Therefore, ensuring \nsustainable public procurement that takes resource use and \nemissions into account plays a key role for SDG 12. A further \nstep needed is to support and develop short supply chains to \navoid transport and carbon emissions. Like in SDG 11 strengthening waste management systems, encouraging recycling, reduction and recovery of waste supports a sustainable way of \ndevelopment. Citizens should be encouraged and enabled to \nchoose products and services with a lower resource footprint.   \n\nENSURE          \nSUSTAINABLE \nCONSUMPTION \nAND                  \nPRODUCTION \nPATTERNS. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 12 \n \n\n150 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 12 l Overview \n \n\nIn SDG 12, a variety of aspects of a circular economy and a sustainable society are addressed. \nIndicators allocated show a predominance in target 12.5 (waste reduction), measuring aspects \nsuch as waste generation, collection, recycling, management, prevention and reduction, as well \nas waste recovery in the food system. \n \nTarget 12.2 (sustainable and efficient use of natural resources) is the target second most represented by indicators, which address issues such as general resource management and resource \nuse efficiency (e.g. land, buildings, energy, industry, water, food and forests). Targets 12.8 (information and awareness), 12.7 (sustainable public procurement) and 12.4 (management of \nchemicals and other wastes) can count on decent numbers of potential indicators as well. \n \nMost other targets are sufficiently covered by indicators, except for targets 12.1 and 12.c: Whilst  \ntarget 12.1 is specifically linked to the UN 10-Year Framework Programme on sustainable production and consumption, target 12.c seems not to be of much relevance for local policy making \nas it is about subsidies for fossil-fuels, which are typically decided at national level. \n \nA large number of those indicators sets screened contributes to this SDG, particularly the EU \nGreen City Tool and EEA Urban Metabolism Framework. There is a good balance between qualitative and quantitative units of measurement. \n \nFigure 12: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 12 \n \n\n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n12.1 Implement the 10-year framework of\u2026\n\n12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management\u2026\n\n12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at\u2026\n\n12.4 By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound\u2026\n\n12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation\u2026\n\n12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and\u2026\n\n12.7 Promote public procurement practices that are\u2026\n\n12.8 By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have\u2026\n\n12.a Support developing countries to strengthen\u2026\n\n12.b Develop and implement tools to monitor\u2026\n\n12.c Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that\u2026\n\nSDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 12 \n\n \n\n151 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 12 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  12.1  Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programs on sustainable \nconsumption and production (10YFP), all countries taking action, with \ndeveloped countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries \n\nNo indicators identified. \n\nTarget  12.2  By 2030, achieve sustainable management and efficient use of  \nnatural resources  \n\nAspect  General \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nHas the city established a long-term strategic plan for sustainable development?

Its impacts are changing weather \npatterns and rising sea levels. Weather events are becoming \nmore extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are currently at \ntheir highest levels ever. If no action is undertaken the world\u2019s \naverage surface temperature will surpass 3 degrees centigrade \nthis century. Thus countries adopted the Paris Agreement at \nthe COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016 \nand had been ratified by 175 parties as of April 2018. In the \nagreement, all countries take responsibility to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees centigrade. The solution of \nthis challenge are cleaner and more resilient economies, based \non renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce emissions, adapt to climate change and enhance resilience. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \n70% of energy-related carbon dioxide is generated by cities because of energy production and transportation based on fossil \nfuels, industry, and biomass consumption. Reason enough to \ntake responsibility. Greenhouse gas emissions have to be decreased, and low emission plans have to be developed. As \nstated above, extreme weather events like storms, floods and \nheavy rains are issues cities more and more have to cope with. \nInclusive approaches to achieve climate change mitigation and \nadaptation are thus crucial for all local governments, followed \nby low emission development strategies that include plans for \ncarbon neutral transportation systems, smart grid networks, \nand green growth. Urban planning has to face construction \nand infrastructure that are more resilient to climate change \nrisks. And citizens need to be involved.  \n\nTAKE URGENT \nACTION TO \nCOMBAT           \nCLIMATE \nCHANGE AND  \nITS IMPACTS. \n \n\f\n \n \nSDG 13 \n \n\n170 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 13 l Overview \n \nSDG 13 gathers 42 different indicators for the assessment and monitoring of only two if its five \ntargets.  \n \nThe largest amount of indicators found could be allocated to target 13.1 (strengthen climate \nresilience and adaptation), reflecting mainly aspects such as risk reduction and resilience plans, \nimpact assessments, adaptation and mitigation measures as well as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nTarget 13.3 (education and awareness raising on climate change) is supported well by indicators \nmirroring aspects such as the level of public awareness of the topic, human and institutional \ncapacity, and general monitoring of CO2 emissions.  \n \nTogether, these two targets are at the heart of local climate action. In contrast, the three remaining targets 13.2 (integration into national policies), 13.a (UN commitment) and 13.b (capacity for climate change-related planning in least developed countries) can hardly be handled \nat the city level, which explains the absence of indicators.  \n \nIn summary, SDG 13 is fairly supported by the availability of relevant indicators and does not \nshow significant gaps for the local level. \n \nFigure 13: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 13 \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n13.1  Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to\nclimate-related hazards and natural disasters in all\u2026\n\n13.2  Integrate climate change measures into national\npolicies, strategies and planning\n\n13.3  Improve education, awareness-raising and\nhuman and institutional capacity on climate change\u2026\n\n13.a  Implement the commitment undertaken by\ndeveloped-country parties to the United Nations\u2026\n\n13.b  Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for\neffective climate change-related planning and\u2026\n\nSDG 13 - Climate action\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 13 \n\n \n\n171 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 13 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  13.1  Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related \nhazards and natural disasters in all countries \n\nAspect  Resilience \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nResilience Plans: This involves implementation of risk and vulnerability assessments, financial (capital and operating) plans and technical systems for \ndisaster mitigation addressing natural and human induced disasters and hazards \n\nQualitative (e.g. \nyes/no), including possible additional remarks on any \nresponse provided.

More than 3 billion people depend on the \noceans for their survival, while fisheries directly or indirectly \nemploy over 200 million people. But in the end we all depend \non them: the rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, \ncoastlines, a lot of our food, and also the oxygen in the air we \nbreathe, it\u2019s all influenced by the sea. Unfortunately, the \nworld\u2019s oceans are strongly harmed by human activities, including contamination, loss of habitats and livestock depletion. The same applies for the planet\u2019s rivers and seas.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nTwo-thirds of the sewage from cities is discharged untreated \ninto lakes, rivers and marine water. Many coastal cities still discharge wastewater directly into marine ecosystems. But also \nevery non-coastal city influences life at and below water e.g. \nby micro plastic or air pollution. Local governments can act \npositively by implementing integrated water resources management and programmes to capture, treat and reuse urban \nstormwater runoff. If located at the coast, they can foster their \nintegrated coastal zone management and conservation strategies as well as they can encourage sustainable fishing practices \nthrough ethical municipal procurement. Local governments \nshould adopt regulations against industrial, municipal and agricultural pollution. Also in case of SDG 14 it\u2019s important to involve all citizens to make them aware of their own impact they \nhave and how they can conserve and sustainably use the \noceans, seas and marine resources.  \n\nCONSERVE AND \nSUSTAINABLY \nUSE THE \nOCEANS, SEAS \nAND MARINE \nRESOURCES \nFOR                   \nSUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 14 \n \n\n178 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 14 l Overview  \n \n\nOnly 33 indicators could be allocated to SDG 14, although this goal is highly connected to other \nSDGs, such as SDG 2 (via farming practices that impact on all water bodies), SDG 6 (via the sewage systems that impact on all water bodies), and SDG 13 (because the health of the oceans\u2019 \necosystems contributes more to climate protection than in-land ecosystems do). \n \nYet, this SDG is one of the most neglected ones, both at international, national and local levels. \nThis lack of interest is also reflected in the lack of data availability and thus of existing indicators \nfor the majority of targets: 6 out of 10 targets are not supported by any of the local indicators \nscreened for this study.  \n \nThere is a significant coverage of target 14.1 (reduce marine pollution), with most of the indicators appearing also under SDG 2 and SDG 6. Target 14.2 (restoration and protection of coastal \necosystems) also shows a good range of indicators, focusing on water quality in general and \necosystem services, with target 14.5 (conserve 10 percent of marine areas) being linked directly. \n \nTarget 14.4 (overfishing) shows a low and insufficient coverage of indicators while it could/ \nshould be monitored by coastal cities depending on fish stock for their local economy. Target \n14.b (small-scale artisanal fishers) is affiliated to target 14.4 and has no indicators. Target 14.6 \n(end fisheries subsidies) concerns national policies which explains the absence of urban local \nindicators here.  \n \nTarget 14.3 (ocean acidification) is very broad, explaining the difficulty to allocate indicators, \nalthough it is linked to other targets. None of the indicators made any direct reference to target \n14.c (implementing UNCLOS law). Target 14.a (marine technology and scientific knowledge development) was not reflected in any of the indicators either. \n \nDespite the contributions made by the RUAF and STAR indicator sets, there seem to be clear \nawareness and indicator gaps to fill for this SDG. \n \nFigure 14: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 14 \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce\u2026\n\n14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect\u2026\n\n14.3 Minimize and address the impacts of ocean\u2026\n\n14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and\u2026\n\n14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of\u2026\n\n14.6 By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries\u2026\n\n14.7 By 2030, increase the economic benefits to\u2026\n\n14.a Increase scientific knowledge, develop research\u2026\n\n14.b Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers\u2026\n\n14.c Enhance the conservation and sustainable use\u2026\n\nSDG 14 - Life below water\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 14 \n\n \n\n179 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 14 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  14.1  By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all \nkinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris \nand nutrient pollution (linked to SDG 2 and SDG 6) \n\nAspect  General \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nNumber of incidents of water or farm land pollution and contamination # 27 \n\nJurisdiction or water provider participates in water quality research on \ncontaminants of emerging concern \n\nyes/no 24 \n\nIndustrial/commercial flood-prone % 14 \n\nDoes your city have a prevention plan for litter in the public spaces (and/ \nor marine litter reduction plan)? yes/no 14, 26 \n\n \n\nAspect  Agricultural pollution \n\n \n\n  \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nTotal land surface of protected environmentally sensitive areas as a result of \nfood production and farm conservation practices \n\nha 27 \n\nShare of agricultural land farmed organically / Share of eco-certified agricultural companies in the urban area \n\n% 23, 8 \n\nTotal i) area of agricultural land and ii) number of farms in the city region \n(rural and urban) for different identifiable production systems (eg organic, \nagro-ecological, conventional, intensive livestock, GM etc) \n\nha 27 \n\nNumber of farms reducing livestock density numbers and reporting improved animal health \n\n# 27 \n\nNitrogen surplus per hectare of agricultural land kg/ha 23 \n\f\n \n \nSDG 14 \n \n\n180 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nAspect  Agricultural pollution \u2013 strategy & policy \n\n \n\nAspect  Wastewater pollution \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nPopulation connected to the sewage system % 10, 26 \n\nPopulation connected to waste water treatment systems with at least secondary treatment \n\n% 8 \n\nPopulation connected to tertiary sewage treatment % 18 \n\nPollution levels at the exit of water sanitation facilities (DBO5, DCO, Ptot) m3/a 13, 22 \n\nIf the city is located in an EU Member State, indicate whether the UWWTP \ncomplies with the treatment requirements under the UWWTD \n\nyes/no 13 \n\n \n\nAspect  Wastewater pollution \u2013 strategy & policy \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nDoes your city have a wastewater management plan or strategy?

Forests that are habitats for about \n80% of all terrestrial species of animals, homes of the indigenous population and subsistence providers for 1.6 billion people. Harvesting natural resources for industrial production and \nurbanisation is one of the most important causes of biodiversity loss. Land degradation and desertification are burning issues.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nAs cities are growing their demands for mineral, land and biodiversity resources are increasing. Existing urban biodiversity \ncan be preserved by zoning schemes, plans and strategic \nchoices as well as enforcement policies. The protection of life \non land should have a monetary budget within local governments. Further it\u2019s important to build more green spaces, also \nin city centres. They improve the air quality and can be a \nchance to promote active living and learning about nature. Local governments can also act as mediator or initiator of cooperation between public institutions, enterprises as well as citizens to foster actions of biodiversity and wildlife protection.  \n\n  \n\nPROTECT,          \nRESTORE AND \nPROMOTE        \nSUSTAINABLE \nUSE OF             \nTERRESTRIAL \nECOSYSTEMS, \nSUSTAINABLY \nMANAGE         \nFORESTS,         \nCOMBAT         \nDESERTIFICATION, HALT \nAND REVERSE \nLAND                \nDEGRADATION \nAND HALT          \nBIODIVERSITY \nLOSS. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 15 \n\n186  ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 15 l Overview \n \n\nSDG 15 is represented by 64 indicators with a strong focus on target 15.5 (reduce habitat and \nbiodiversity loss). They assess the presence and quality of natural areas in the city, as well as \nthe presence of specific protected natural areas, the abundance of biodiversity and changes in \nthe numbers of species. Indicators on biodiversity action plans and (the existence of) single actions are included as well. \n \nTarget 15.9 (integrate biodiversity in planning) is affiliated to target 15.5 and complements it \nwith indicators on green infrastructure, ecosystem services, heat islands, and biodiversity \nawareness. This target is further affiliated to target 15.a (financial resources for biodiversity and \necosystems). \n \nSince target 15.3 (land degradation) can be considered going beyond desertification and flood \ndamages, indicators on urban sprawl and soil sealing are relevant here. Indicators overlap with \ntarget 11.3 and can be complemented further by referring to this other target. \n \nTargets 15.1 (freshwater ecosystems) and 15.8 (alien species) have a few key indicators that \nhelp embracing the target despite their small number. In contrast, target 15.2 (sustainable forest management) is underrepresented. This can be explained by the fact that this target would \ntypically be addressed in rural rather than urban areas.  \n \nAlso some other targets could not be supported by indicators from the sets considered for this \nreport, for different reasons. This applies for the geographic scope of target 15.4 (mountain \necosystems) for example, or the national level of governance for target 15.7 (trafficking of protected species) and target 15.c (global support to combat poaching). \n \nGenerally, three types of indicators have been found: \n\n\u2022 Indicators of status (e.g. percentage of protected areas) \n\n\u2022 Dynamic indicators which show progress: changes (e.g. increase of protected areas) \n\nand distance to target (e.g. percentage of actions implemented) \n\n\u2022 Binary indicators related to action plans and implementation: Existence or non-exist\nence (yes/no)  \n\nIn summary, the most relevant targets from an urban perspective are covered by a good range \nof indicators.

The bigger a city is the bigger is the mixture of \nethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. It\u2019s on the local governments to take care of every one of them and to make sure that \nno group is excluded. Cities are not only hubs of innovation but \nalso centres of crime. Reducing violence in urban areas has to \nhave high priority.  \n\nPROMOTE \nPEACEFUL AND \nINCLUSIVE        \nSOCIETIES FOR \nSUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT, \nPROVIDE           \nACCESS TO      \nJUSTICE FOR \nALL AND BUILD \nEFFECTIVE,         \nACCOUNTABLE \nAND INCLUSIVE \nINSTITUTIONS \nAT ALL LEVELS.  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 16 \n\n196 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 16 l Overview \n \n\nWith a total of 91 indicators allocated to SDG 16, the distribution among its targets shows an \nuneven coverage. There is a clear focus on target 16.1 (violence and related deaths), mainly \nreferring to aspects such as the general level, amount and perception of violence in the city, but \nalso to specific crimes against women, violence in schools and property infractions. Indicators \non assistance programmes and response capacity against crimes, fires and other emergencies \nto protect the population are included as well. \n \nTarget 16.7 (representative decision-making) is supported by indicators addressing aspects such \nas civil diversity and societal engagement, participatory decision-making, autonomy and election turn-out at the local level, participation rates in EU elections and international agreements. \n \nTarget 16.6 (accountable and transparent institutions) displays indicators for effectiveness, accountability and transparency of the local government, including topics such as financial documentation and e-government. Target 16.3 (rule of law) presents affiliated indicators dealing \nwith the fairness of police services vis-\u00e0-vis citizens, and the fairness of the justice system in \nresponding to complaints. Also, target 16.5 (corruption and bribery) is addressed by only a few \nindicators which however tackle the target directly. \n \nTarget 16.10 (access to information) can be assessed through indicators for open data practices, \nhowever less so for other aspects. In contrast, the remaining targets are hardly represented by \nindicators as they mainly refer to international policy. This is particularly the case for target 16.8 \n(participation of developing countries in global governance), target 16.a (combat terrorism and \nviolence), and target 16.b (non-discriminatory laws in developing countries).  \n \nIn summary, there is a good basis for monitoring SDG 16 at the local level, nonetheless minor \ngaps are present. \n \n\nFigure 16: Number of indicators identified for

It addresses the need for partnerships between governments, the \nprivate sector and civil society. These inclusive partnerships \nare needed at the global, regional, national as well as the local \nlevel. The United Nations see the most import actions in longterm investments, including foreign direct investment, especially in developing countries. These should go to sustainable \nenergy, infrastructure and transport, as well as information \nand communication technologies. The public sector is addressed to set a clear direction and to revise and proof frameworks, regulations and incentive structures that enable such \ninvestments.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nCities and local governments are in an ideal position to support \nand encourage networks like private public partnerships, including also the civil society in the communities. Such municipal cooperation can also attract financial means to implement \ndifferent projects, and can promote better inclusiveness during their implementation. The possibilities of partnerships and \nprojects are numerous and diverse as cities are hubs of education, culture, economic development and infrastructure. Cities \ncan also take an active part by assisting stakeholders with coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring to achieve long-term debt sustainability.  \n\nSTRENGTHEN \nTHE MEANS OF \nIMPLEMENTATION AND         \nREVITALIZE THE \nGLOBAL         \nPARTNERSHIP \nFOR                   \nSUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 17 \n\n208 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 17 l Overview \n \n\nLast but not least, SDG 17 is represented by 82 indicators dealing with the optimisation of resources, knowledge and tools to reach all the SDGs, in an interdisciplinary and multiscale glance.  \nThere is a predominating coverage of target 17.17 (multistakeholder partnerships), addressing \naspects such as the general type and level of involvement of the society, the diversity of stakeholders, the engagement of the local government with other governments and private entities, \nand the harmonization of visions among departments beyond jurisdictions. Specific indicators \nare provided for the food, energy, water and urban planning sectors.  \n \nMany indicators were found for assessing target 17.8 (access to information and communications technology), target 17.14 (policy coherence for sustainable development), as well as for \ntarget 17.19 (data, monitoring and accountability practices). Other targets see a lower number \nof indicators, which however represent a basis for monitoring them. \n \nTargets 17.5 (investment promotion regimes for least developed countries), 17.9 (international \nsupport), 17.12 (duty-free quota-free market access for least developed countries), 17.13 (macroeconomic stability), 17.15 (country\u2019s policy leadership) are not supported by any of the indicators screened as these targets are too much oriented towards the national level.  \n \nVarious indicator sets contributed to this SDG, among them the EU Green City Tool and the \nReference Framework for Sustainable Cities.

They are very peculiar ecosystem types: they are almost completely artificial but they include, in different proportions, all other ecosystem types (forests, lakes and rivers and agricultural areas can all be part of urban fringe) and they are strongly influenced by human activities.\nIn the last twenty years urbanization has increased in Europe. At EU level, areas dominated by the presence of artificial land increased with 3.2% between 2000 and 2018. When considering the share of dominant land types (the proportion of areas dominated by artificial, agricultural or natural land), 69% of Functional Urban Area remained relatively stable, with no clear direction of change. When a change has occurred, it has been characterized by a loss of agricultural or natural land and an increase in areas with no clear characterization, which is a proxy of urban sprawl. Functional Urban Areas are characterized by a progressive densification of settlements. The vegetation cover of urban green infrastructure has been relatively stable in the long term, with a slight upward trend in areas of the cities that are not densely built in both core cities and commuting zones. However, when focusing on the balance between abrupt greening (defined as a relatively sharp upward trend in urban vegetation) and browning (defined as a relatively fast loss in urban vegetation), cities are not able to compensate for land taken. This means that when a loss of vegetation is observed (usually due to land use change, i.e. housing or infrastructure policies) there is no corresponding compensation strategy in place to recover the vegetation within the green infrastructure. This can result in progressive increase in fragmentation of semi-natural patches and consequential loss of city resilience. Cities and their surroundings can be part of the solution. They can host biodiversity spots and Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can deliver important benefits and be part of a regional eco-networks. However, defining a clear role of urban ecosystems within sectoral EU legislation and policies is required. Clear rules need to be set to compensate for land taken and vegetation loss. Moreover, there is a need for setting targets to specifically monitor urban condition, urban biodiversity and urban their ecosystem services.\nExtent and change:\nEurope experienced an increase of urban ecosystem type over the last 20 years with the overall area covered by urban ecosystems increasing by over 12 000 km\u00b2 (or 3.4%) since 2000.\nDrivers and pressures:\nThe total air pollutants emissions (within Functional Urban Areas) registered a reduction in the long and short term (see fact sheet 3.1.101). The result is consistent with other assessments at national level (EEA 2019a; EEA 2019b; EEA 2020). Proxies of land degradation were soil sealing and municipal waste. In both cases a degradation was registered. The share of sealed soil is significantly increasing in core cities, both in densely built areas and even more so in not-densely built areas where there are still opportunities for alternative solutions for dealing with territorial development. Municipal waste, which depends on urbanization, population density and lifestyle, is also increasing slightly in the long term. Nevertheless, the trend varies a lot among Member States, not only in terms of total amount generated but also concerning management and treatment strategies (see fact sheet 3.1.102). The analysis confirms an overall reduction in total air pollutants emissions within FUA. A more detailed analysis could consider the different sources of emissions to verify which sector is responsible for the trends. Indicators connected with urbanization present upward trends with potentially negative consequences. An example is that, the persistent increase of impervious surfaces reduces resilience of urban ecosystems and exposes them to risks presented by climatic events (flooding or heat waves).\nEcosystem condition\nIndicators that represent environmental quality are improving at an aggregated EU level. With regards to air pollutants concentrations, on the long term, and using aggregated average data, the situation seems to improve for the pollutants considered and the trend is consistent with other assessments which report specifically on air quality in Europe (EEA 2019b). There has been an increase in bathing locations with good water quality. The exposure to harmful levels of noise pollution derived from roads is stable for the cities where data were available and comparable. Structural ecosystem attributes, which represent the configuration of urban ecosystems, offer a slightly different picture and demonstrate a clear and intense process of urbanization in Europe. The extension of artificial areas in the long term (by 3.2%) and short term is increasing (by 2%). There is an increase in the proportion of areas dominated by artificial land type and of land with no dominant land type (zones where there is a mix of land uses). In parallel, we register a loss of areas with dominance of agricultural land or natural land. The process is confirmed by other indicators, which can be reported in more detail and for which results are statistically significant. There is a loss of areas without settlements and a relatively rapid densification of settlements within FUA.\nConvergence of evidence\nAll air pollutants emissions marked an improvement in the short and long term (5 pollutants); municipal waste generated remained stable in the short and long term (1 indicator) and imperviousness registered a change resulting in degradation in the short term (2 indicators). No indicators, consistent with the rest of the assessment, were available for land take.In terms of condition, the concentration of all air pollutants marked an improvement in the short and long term (4 pollutants). Noise pollution from roads remained stable in the short term (1 indicator) and bathing water quality improved in the short and long term (2 indicators).\nPolicy options\nChallenges for policies on urban ecosystems fall under different categories:\n-Compensation policies and biodiversity-friendly areas.\n-To limit the degradation of Urban Green Infrastructure more focus should be placed on.\n-Land take compensation policies. In practice, compensating for land take affects a multitude of projects (even small size ones) that \u201cconsume\u201d agricultural and natural land.\n-Management practices within Urban Green Infrastructure should carefully consider the importance of biodiversity-friendly areas.\n-The role of citizens\nLifestyle and citizen engagement play a key role in the impact that population density and population dynamic (growth, structure, mobility) have on ecosystems. This is true for most topics covered in this assessment. Air pollutants emissions, concentrations and population exposure, for instance, depend (at least in part) on lifestyle choices, connected to mobility and transportation or energy use (Ballesta et al. 2006; Priddle 2018). Sustainable consumption, recycle and lifestyle affect municipal waste management and land take (Colsaet 2017; Gaudillat et al. 2018). Proper, responsible conduct is very important for biodiversity and nature conservation when enjoying nature-based recreation activities and when managing domestic gardens (Goddard et al. 2010; Nilon 2010; Beumer and Martens 2015).\nA well-managed Urban Green Infrastructure is essential to support Urban Ecosystem Services such as microclimate regulation, noise reduction, flood protection, air quality regulation and nature-based recreation. The mainstreaming of Urban Ecosystem Services into urban policy making has started (many cities already have in place specific strategies on Urban Green Infrastructure) and has been promoted at EU level (EC 2019d). Nonetheless, there is a need for setting targets to specifically monitor urban condition, biodiversity and ecosystem services. The issue was discussed in October 2019, during the EU week on regions and cities , where one of the takeaway messages was that as researchers we can set up assessment frameworks but targets for monitoring urban biodiversity and ecosystem services should be set up at a local level, taking into account specific territorial context. In order to be financed and adequately implemented at a local level, NBS should be officially recognized and included in policy regulations. One of the final objectives of the Action Plan of the Partnership on Sustainable Land Use was to promote NBS as a tool to build sustainable, resilient and livable urban areas, with specific requests for a better regulation to boost NBS at European, national and local levels; and better financing for NBS.\nPolicies related to urban ecosystems should be structured on three levels which are complementary and not mutually exclusive:\n1) Municipal level; district level a.

The connection between urban ecosystems and the other ecosystems types should be taken into account, especially with regards to: i. croplands and the role of local agricultural production in the local market, ii. forest and its role within the Urban Green Infrastructure.\n3) Regional level and National level. The regional network of cities should be considered with a view that can reflect the overall impact of urbanized areas on the ecosystems\nConclusion\nCities are not \u201csingle entities\u201d and they do not only include artificial areas. They are part of a complex largerscale, socio-ecological system. This assessment demonstrates that is very difficult and scientifically challenging to synthetize the complex dynamics of cities into a set of simple key messages or aggregated trends. However, what seems to be very important is to set up and test monitoring frameworks that help cities to identify whether their change is normal or unusual in the EU and regional context, or to provide evidence that some mayors are concerned with maintaining natural habitat in living environment of people. Functional Urban Areas, the core cities and their commuting zones, where most European citizens live and work cover 20% of the EU territory. Urban population is increasing with regional patterns that are connected to different stages of economic development. Urbanization is increasing and this is confirmed by pressure indicators (increase impact of municipal waste or sealed soil); environmental quality indicators (population density) and structural ecosystem attributes, such as the degree of densification of settlements within FUA; a decline of number of areas occupied by croplands or natural areas and the increase of areas with a mix of uses. The commuting zones are assuming characteristics similar to the core cities. When evaluating the trends in vegetation cover of Urban Green Infrastructure, we recorded a more intense loss of vegetation within commuting zones than within core cities. Pressures and environmental quality indicators that have a clear EU regulation (noise pollution, air pollutants emissions and concentrations, bathing water) are all stable or improving at EU level.", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

The EEA Project Manager for the \nreport was Peter Kristensen. The report is based on the work \nof the European Topic Centre for Inland, Coastal and Marine \nWaters (ETC/ICM) and the EEA on the Water Framework \nDirective and on information and data from the river basin \nmanagement plans, supplemented with information from \n\nmany water reports.

The following key European water \nmanagement challenges have been selected for presentation in this report:\n\n\u2022 pollution pressures, including point source pollution, diffuse source pollution, including scattered dwellings, and \npollution pressures from mining;\n\n\u2022 hydromorphological pressures, including issues related to barriers, loss of lateral connectivity, pressures from \nhydropower and pressures from inland navigation;\n\n\u2022 abstractions and water scarcity;\n\n\u2022 aquaculture; \n\n\u2022 invasive alien species.\n\nA broad range of technical and management measures are already available to tackle the selected key European water \nmanagement challenges. The measures required can be mobilised through better implementation of the existing \nlegislative framework on water and the introduction of supplementary measures that further reduce key pressures.\n\nSome cross-cutting issues of EU-wide relevance to the implementation of measures for addressing the selected key \nEuropean water management challenges are highlighted.\n\n\u2022 First, to meet EU targets and goals on water resources, greater coherence is needed in the specific objectives \nand management responses of the relevant EU directives and policies, in particular nature conservation plans, \nprogrammes of measures under the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive, and management \ninterventions based on other policies such as the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive.\n\n\u2022 Second, the use of multi-benefit measures, such as water retention measures, nature-based solutions and land use \nchange measures, is an effective solution for coordinating management responses. Enhancing the use of multi-benefit \nmeasures can help to shift the focus from single-issue solutions to an integrated management approach.\n\n\u2022 Third, water-using sectors, such as agriculture, energy, mining, aquaculture and navigation, should adopt \nmanagement practices that can keep water ecosystems healthy and resilient.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, financial support for the implementation of measures needs to be mobilised from all available funding sources \nat local, regional, national and European levels. The success of implementation also depends on using financial \ninstruments beyond water policies including sectoral ones, for example from agricultural, fisheries and biodiversity \npolicies.\n\f\n\u00a9 Joanna Wnuk, WaterPix/EA\n\f\n9Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nExecutive summary\n\nThis report aims to give a European overview of the main drivers \nand pressures that are at the core of key water management \nchallenges and which put European water bodies most at risk \nof not achieving key environmental objectives. Identifying the \npressures from and drivers of key water management challenges \nat the European level can help in prioritising the main issues that \nshould be tackled with measures.\n\nKey management challenges for European waters, in particular \nthose related to the degradation of freshwater ecosystems, \npollution from chemicals and nutrients, and water abstraction \nand scarcity, are addressed by different EU strategies and \npolicies, which are further operationalised in management \nresponses to the water and environmental EU directives. \nHarmonising the objectives and management responses \nof different policies to tackle these key water management \nchallenges is one of the ambitions of the European Green \nDeal and its associated strategies. Examples are the new \nbiodiversity strategy for 2030, the Farm to Fork strategy, the \nchemicals strategy for sustainability, the new EU strategy on \nadaptation to climate change and the zero pollution action plan. \nThe ambitious targets of these strategies address the main \npressures on European waters, such as combatting disrupted \nriver\tcontinuity\tby\taiming\tto\trestore\t25\u00a0000\u00a0km\tof\tfree-flowing \nrivers by 2030 or counteracting high discharges of nutrients \nand chemicals from agriculture by aiming to reduce the loss of \nnutrients\tand\tthe\tuse\tand\trisks\tof\tusing\tpesticides\tby\t50\u00a0%.\n\nA key source of information for defining key management \nchallenges for European freshwaters is the river basin \nmanagement plans (RBMPs) of the Water Framework Directive \n(WFD). The latest (second) RBMPs showed that a large share of \nEuropean waters still fail to achieve the objective of good status, \nas a result of significant pressures on their hydromorphology \nand pressures arising from pollution from diffuse and point \nsources and from water abstraction.\n\nBased on the analysis of significant pressures and drivers \naffecting water bodies in the latest RBMPs, 10 key European \nwater management challenges were selected to be presented. \nIn addition to describing the main sources and sectoral activities \nbehind key pressures and the main associated impacts, the \nkey measures that are available to tackle these challenges in \nEuropean countries are summarised. Most of the selected \npressures and drivers regarding pollution, hydromorphology \nand abstractions affect a large share of European water bodies \nand are reported to be experienced by a large number of \n\ncountries. Some other pressures, such as mining, navigation, \naquaculture and invasive alien species, seem to affect only \na small share of European water bodies, but they can be of \nconsiderable importance and intensity in specific regions of \nEurope, thus significantly contributing to the failure to achieve \ngood water status at a regional level. Table ES.1 summarises \nthe drivers of and pressures arising from the key European \nwater management challenges presented in the report. More \ndetails on their key impacts on water ecosystems and key \nmeasures and management challenges of EU-wide relevance \nare available in Chapter 3.\n\nA broad range of technical and management measures are \nalready available to tackle the selected key European water \nmanagement challenges. The measures required can be \nmobilised through better implementation of the existing \nlegislative framework on water and the introduction of \nsupplementary measures that further reduce key pressures.\n\nSome cross-cutting issues of EU-wide relevance for the \nimplementation of measures for addressing the selected key \nEuropean water management challenges are highlighted. \nThese cross-cutting issues are discussed with emphasis on \ntheir role in improving and accelerating the implementation \nof measures to achieve the WFD objective of good status for \nEuropean waters.\n\nFirst, to meet EU targets and goals on water resources, \ngreater coherence is needed in the specific objectives and \nmanagement responses of the relevant EU directives and \npolicies. This applies in particular to nature conservation \nplans, programmes of measures under the WFD and Floods \nDirective, and management interventions based on other \npolicies such as the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive.\n\nSecond, the use of multi-benefit measures, such as water \nretention measures, nature-based solutions and land use \nchange measures, is an effective solution for coordinating \nmanagement responses. Enhancing the use of multi-benefit \nmeasures can help to shift the focus from single-issue \nsolutions to an integrated management approach, such \nas ecosystem-based management for the improvement of \necosystem services and using catchment-based approaches.\n\nThird, water-using sectors, such as agriculture, energy, \nmining, aquaculture and navigation, should adopt \nmanagement practices that can keep water ecosystems \n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n10 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nhealthy and resilient. The report describes several existing \nsustainable sectoral initiatives at regional and national \nlevels, such as sustainable farming programmes, sustainable \nhydropower and navigation strategies, and codes of good \npractice for aquaculture. Such initiatives intend to reduce \nthe pressures and impacts of sectoral activities on water \nresources and need further upscaling.

The success of \nimplementation also depends on using financial instruments \nbeyond water policies, including sectoral ones, e.g. from \nagricultural, fisheries and biodiversity policies. Furthermore, \nthe report presents innovative financing mechanisms, including \nthe participation of industry, and some of the mechanisms that \nhave already been set up in European countries.\n\nTable ES.1 Overview of pressures, sectors and activities for selected key European water \nmanagement\u00a0challenges \n\f\n11Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n1 \nIntroduction\n\nWater is an essential resource for human health, food \nproduction, energy production, transport and nature. \nSecuring sustainable management of water and of aquatic \nand water-dependent ecosystems and ensuring that enough \nhigh-quality water is available for all purposes remains one of \nthe key challenges of our time in Europe and is the main aim of \nEU water policy and the European Green Deal.\n\nThe European Green Deal, adopted towards the end of 2019 \n(EC, 2019d), set a new milestone in European environmental \npolicy and it creates a framework for transitioning to a modern, \nresource-efficient and competitive economy. Several goals \nand targets of the European Green Deal are relevant to water \nresources, for instance restoring ecosystems, reducing pollution \nfrom different sources and using resources more efficiently. At \nthe same time, many actions are ongoing and further efforts \nare needed across Europe to achieve the objective of the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD) for all surface water bodies and \ngroundwater to achieve good status by 2027 at the latest. In this \ncontext of existing and new policies, European countries are \ncalled on to address several key water management challenges, \nin particular those related to the degradation of freshwater \necosystems, pollution from chemicals and nutrients, and water \nabstraction and scarcity.\n\n1.1 Aims of this report\n\nThis report builds on the 2018 EEA assessment of the status \nof and pressures on European waters (EEA, 2018b). In that \nassessment, the EEA concluded that European waters \nremained under significant pressures linked to changes in \ntheir hydromorphology and pressures from pollution arising \nfrom diffuse and point sources and from water abstraction. \nThe report noted limited progress in improving water status \nbetween the first and the second planning cycle of the WFD. \nThe pressures on European waters often act at the same time \nand affect the efficient functioning of ecosystems, contribute \nto biodiversity loss and threaten the valuable benefits that \n\nwater brings to society and the economy. However, the 2018 \nreport did not include a detailed assessment of the main \ndrivers and pressures causing less than good status in EU water \nbodies. This report takes the 2018 assessment of water status \nand pressures one step further and aims to give a European \noverview of the main drivers and pressures that are at the core \nof key water management challenges at the European level.\n\nThe key water management challenges identified in this \nreport are a structured presentation of EU-level evidence \non the main drivers and pressures that put European water \nbodies most at risk of not achieving the WFD's environmental \nobjectives. The presentation of these key water management \nchallenges aims to improve our understanding of the main \nsources and sectoral activities behind key pressures and the \nmain associated impacts. In addition, the key measures that \nare available to tackle these challenges across most European \ncountries and management issues of EU-wide relevance \nare\u00a0summarised.\n\nIdentifying the pressures and drivers of key water management \nchallenges at the European level can help in prioritising the \nmain issues that should be tackled with measures, especially \nthose set out in the river basin management plans (RBMPs) \nunder the WFD (Figure 1.1). The identification of key European \nwater management challenges can also support the assessment \nof the upcoming third RBMPs, especially in terms of whether \nefforts and resources in the third cycle are being directed to \naddressing the most challenging issues.\n\nFigure 1.1 Key European water management \nchallenges\n\nKey water \nmanagement \nchallenges\n\nPressures\n\nShape priority issues to \nbe tackled with measures\n\nDrivers+\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n12 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nThe European Green Deal\n\nThe\nEuropean\n\nGreen \nDeal \n\nMobilising industry\nfor a clean and circular economy\n\nPreserving and restoring ecosystems\nand biodiversity\n\nLeave no one behind\n(Just Transi\ufffdon)\n\nFrom \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019: a fair, healthy\nand environmentally friendly food\n\nsystem \n\nBuilding and renova\ufffdng in an energy\nand resource efficient way\n\nAccelera\ufffdng the shi\ufffd to sustainable\nand smart mobility\n\nIncreasing the EU\u2019s Climate ambi\ufffdon\nfor 2030 and 2050\n\nSupplying clean, affordable \nand secure energy\n\nFinancing the transi\ufffdon\n\nA zero pollu\ufffdon ambi\ufffdon\nfor a toxic-free environment\n\nA European \nClimate Pact\n\nThe EU as a \nglobal leader\n\nMobilising research\nand fostering innova\ufffdon\n\nTransforming the\nEU\u2019s economy for a \nsustainable future\n\nBased on the analysis of significant pressures and drivers \naffecting water bodies in the latest (second) RBMPs, the \nfollowing key European water management challenges have \nbeen selected for presentation in this report:\n\n\u2022 pollution pressures, including point source pollution, \ndiffuse source pollution; including scattered dwellings, and \npollution pressures from mining;\n\n\u2022 hydromorphological pressures, including issues related \nto barriers, loss of lateral connectivity, pressures from \nhydropower and pressures from inland navigation;\n\n\u2022 abstractions and water scarcity;\n\n\u2022 aquaculture; \n\n\u2022 invasive alien species.\n\nKey European water management challenges were selected \nthat affect a sufficiently large share of European water \nbodies and that have been important for long enough to \ndevelop a solid knowledge and information base, from which \nto describe the scope of the issue at the European level (see \nChapter 3 for more information).\n\nThe report also discusses cross-cutting issues of EU-wide \nrelevance in implementing measures for addressing the \nmain drivers of and pressures arising from key European \n\nwater management challenges. These cross-cutting issues \nare discussed with emphasis on their role in improving and \naccelerating the implementation of measures to achieve the \nWFD objective of good status in European waters.\n\n1.2 Policy context\n\nThe key aspects and aims of the European Green Deal are \nshown in Figure 1.2. The European Green Deal includes \na number of key EU strategies with targets relevant to \nwater, such as the policy initiatives of the Farm to Fork \nstrategy (EC,\u00a02020c), the new biodiversity strategy for \n2030 (EC, 2020b), the new EU strategy on adaptation to \nclimate change (EC, 2021a) and the zero pollution action \nplan\u00a0(EC,\u00a02021b). The targets of these strategies are \nexpected to have far-reaching impacts on several of the \nkey European water management challenges presented in \nthis report. Further EU strategies with high-level targets for \nwater include the proposal for the Eighth Environmental \nAction Programme (EC,\u00a02020f) and the implementation \nof the Sustainable Development Goals (EC, 2016a) (see \nTable 1.1). In addition, in 2019 the European Commission \npublished the evaluation of water legislation, the Fitness \nCheck, and this provides the main directions for revisions \nand future water policies (EC,\u00a02019b).\n\nFigure 1.2 Key aspects and aims of the European Green Deal\n\nSource: Communication from the European Commission on the European Green Deal (EC, 2019d).\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n13Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nEU strategy Key targets related to water \n\nEuropean Green Deal \n(EC, 2019d)\n\nRoadmap with actions up to 2050 to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a more circular \neconomy and stop climate change, reverse biodiversity loss and cut pollution\n\nFarm to Fork strategy  \n(EC, 2020e)\n\n\u2022 50\u00a0%\treduction\tin\tuse\tof\tand\trisk\tfrom\tpesticides\n\u2022 50\u00a0%\treduction\tin\tnutrient\tlosses\n\u2022 20\u00a0%\treduction\tin\tthe\tuse\tof\tfertilisers\n\u2022 50\u00a0%\treduction\tin\tthe\tuse\tof\tantimicrobials\n\u2022 25\u00a0%\tincrease\tin\tthe\tamount\tof\torganic\tfarming\n\nBiodiversity strategy \nfor 2030 (EC, 2020b)\n\n\u2022 30\u00a0%\tof\tEU\tland\tand\tsea\tprotected,\tone\tthird\tof\twhich\tis\tunder\t'strict\tprotection'\n\u2022 No\tdeterioration\tin\tany\tprotected\thabitats\tand\tspecies\tby\t2030;\ttrend\tto\tbe\tpositive\tfor\tat\tleast\t30\u00a0%\t\n\nof them\n\u2022 >\u00a010\u00a0%\tincrease\tin\tbiodiverse\tlandscape\tfeatures\n\u2022 Increased efforts to restore freshwater ecosystems and the natural functions of rivers\n\u2022 Restore\tat\tleast\t25\u00a0000\u00a0km\tof\tfree-flowing\trivers\tby\tremoving\tprimarily\tobsolete\tbarriers\tand\t\n\nrestoring floodplains and wetlands\n\u2022 Member States to review water abstraction and impoundment permits to restore and preserve \n\necological flows\n\u2022 Focus on implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation including the objectives \n\nof the WFD, which are to be met by 2027\n\u2022 Reduce\tthe\tuse\tof\tand\trisk\tfrom\tpesticides\tby\t50\u00a0%\n\u2022 Reduce\tpollution\tfrom\tfertilisers\tby\t50\u00a0%\tand\ttheir\tuse\tby\t20\u00a0%\t\n\u2022 Enable actions to achieve transformative change such as promotion of nature-based solutions\n\nChemicals strategy \nfor sustainability \ntowards a toxic-free \nenvironment \n(EC,\u00a02020a)\t\n\n\u2022 Ban the most harmful chemicals\n\u2022 Account for the cocktail effect of chemicals\n\u2022 Phase out per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\n\u2022 Boost the production and use of chemicals that are safe and sustainable by design throughout their \n\nlife cycle\n\u2022 Promote the EU's resilience of supply and the sustainability of critical chemicals \n\nZero pollution action \nplan (EC, 2021b) \n\nPollution is reduced to levels no longer considered harmful to health and natural ecosystems with the \nfollowing targets related to water:\n\u2022 Reduce\tby\t50\t%\tnutrient\tlosses,\tthe\tuse\tand\trisk\tof\tchemical\tpesticides,\tthe\tuse\tof\tthe\tmore\t\n\nhazardous ones, and the sale of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture;

They are also implemented through directives \nrelated to specific issues, such as the Urban Waste Water \nTreatment Directive (UWWTD), the Nitrates Directive and the \nSustainable Use of Pesticides Directive. The water-related \ncontributions of these directives to EU strategies are briefly \ndescribed in this section.\n\nThe WFD (EU, 2000) aims to achieve good status of all surface \nwaters and groundwater in Europe. With its programme \nof measures, the WFD addresses most of the previously \nmentioned targets and goals and is therefore key for water \nmanagement. In 2009, EU Member States published the first \nRBMPs and in 2015 the second RBMPs on how to achieve the \nenvironmental objectives of the WFD. At present, EU Member \nStates are finalising the third RBMPs, to be published in 2021, \nwhich will frame the management of water resources in the \nthird WFD planning cycle, covering the period up to the end \nof 2027. More information on the implementation of the WFD \nand assessments of the latest second RBMPs are available in \nthe European Commission's fifth WFD implementation report, \npublished in 2019 (EC, 2019a). The Commission also evaluates \nthe programmes of measures expected to be implemented \nduring the second RBMP period (2016-2021) at both the \nEuropean and national levels. EU Member States reported the \nprogress in implementing measures in December 2018 and \nthe Commission's evaluation of the progress will be published \nin\u00a02021.\n\nThe goal of the Floods Directive (EU, 2007b) is the \nsustainable management of flood risks to reduce the \nnegative consequences of flooding on, for example, human \nhealth and the environment. Member States are requested \nto develop a programme of measures, which includes \nwin-win measures in coordination with the implementation \nof WFD measures.\n\nSustainable \nDevelopment Goals \n\nGoal 6 is to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by:\n\u2022 improving water quality by reducing pollution\n\u2022 substantially increasing water use efficiency across all sectors and ensuring sustainable withdrawals \n\nand a supply of freshwater\n\u2022 implementing integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary \n\ncooperation as appropriate\n\u2022 protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, \n\naquifers and lakes\n\nTable 1.1 Overview of EU policies and strategies and key targets related to water (cont.)\n\nTargets for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems are also \nconsidered by the Habitats Directive (EU, 1992), which aims \nat the conservation of rare habitat types and threatened or \nendemic animal and plant species, and the Birds Directive \n(EU\u00a02009b),\twhich\tfocuses on the protection of 500 wild bird \nspecies, including their habitats in the form of protected areas. \nThese areas are part of the Natura 2000 network set up under \nthe Habitats Directive.\n\nThe UWWTD (EU 1991a) specifically addresses the reduction \nof nutrient and chemical pollution to waters. Other directives \nand pieces of legislation related to chemicals in waters are the \nREACH Regulation (EU, 2006c) on the registration, evaluation, \nauthorisation and restriction of chemicals and the Industrial \nEmissions Directive (IED) on industrial emissions for integrated \npollution prevention and control. Furthermore, the Nitrates \nDirective (EU, 1991b) and the Sustainable Use of Pesticides \nDirective (EU, 2009a) aim to avoid nutrient and chemical pollution \nfrom agriculture into soil and waters, and they are specifically \nlinked to the Farm to Fork strategy. For both directives, Member \nStates are obliged to establish national action plans, including \nmitigation measures, to fulfil the directives' requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the regulation on the prevention and management \nof the introduction and spread of invasive alien species \n(IAS\u00a0Regulation)\t(EU, 2014) and the Eel Regulation (EU, 2007a) \nsupport targets of the EU biodiversity strategy. The Bathing \nWater Directive (EU, 2006a) and the Drinking Water Directive \n(EU, 2020) set quality standards for waters, relevant for human \nhealth. To ensure that water is safe to use, sources of pollution \non a catchment scale need to be considered. However, a link to \ndirectives addressing chemical or nutrient pollution (as previously \nmentioned) is crucial.\n\nAll of these policies constitute an elaborate set of European \nenvironmental policies and standards that provide the \nframework for planning and implementing measures to address \nthe key European water management challenges presented in \nthis report.\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n15Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n1.3 Structure of this report\n\nChapter 2 recaps the key findings of the 2018 EEA assessment \nof the status of and pressures on European waters. The \nresults of the 2018 assessment have been updated to include \nreporting information from more countries (EU-27 plus Norway \nand the United Kingdom) compared with those assessed \nin\u00a02018.\tChapter\t2\tthus\tpresents\tan\tupdated\tsummary\tof\tthe\t\ninformation published by the EEA in 2018 (which was based \non\u00a025\tMember\tStates).\n\nChapter 3 presents the drivers of and pressures arising from \nselected key European water management challenges and gives \nan overview of each issue in Europe, the main impacts on water \necosystems and key measures available to tackle the issue. \nChapter 3 also briefly explains how the key water management \nchallenges have been selected and the information used to \n\ndescribe them (based on the WFD reporting and other sources \nof information on sectors, activities and impacts).\n\nIn Chapter 4, the report discusses certain cross-cutting \nissues of EU-wide relevance in implementing measures for \naddressing key European water management challenges. \nThese\u00a0cross-cutting\tchallenges\taddress:\n\n1. the coherence of EU policies and their management \nresponses to reduce pressures in the water environment;\n\n2. the coherence of sectoral strategies with water policy \nobjectives;\n\n3. the funding of measures; \n\n4. the role of multi-benefit measures.\n\n\u00a9 EEA\n\f\n\u00a9 Anna Stankiewicz, WaterPix/EEA\n\f\n17Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n2\nStatus of and pressures \n\non Europe's waters in the \nsecond\u00a0RBMPs\n\nIn 2019, the European Commission published its report on \nthe assessment of the second river basin management plans \n(RBMPs) and the first flood risk management plans (FRMPs) \n(EC, 2019a), including a detailed analysis of Member States' \nprogrammes of measures and country-specific and EU-wide \nrecommendations to tackle water management challenges. \nTo accompany and inform the assessment, the EEA produced \na report on the state of Europe's waters (EEA, 2018b). In \naddition, the Water Information System for Europe (WISE) \nWater Framework Directive (WFD) visualisation tool presents \nmore\tand\tmore\tdetailed\tresults\u00a0(1).\n\nThis chapter is an updated version of part of the executive \nsummary\u00a0(2) of the EEA 2018 report on the state of Europe's \nwaters (EEA, 2018b). Although the 2018 EEA report was based \non data from 25 EU Member States, this updated chapter \nis based on additional data from Greece, Ireland, Lithuania \nand Norway. Therefore, the results presented in this chapter \non the water status and pressures cover the 27 EU Member \nStates,\tNorway\tand\tthe\tUnited\tKingdom\u00a0(3). Throughout this \nreport, the term 'WFD countries' is used to cover the countries \nthat implement the WFD: the 27 EU Member States, Norway \nand the United Kingdom.\n\n2.1 Improvements in monitoring \nand\u00a0assessment\n\nIn comparison with the first RBMPs, the quantity and quality \nof the evidence available on the water status and pressures \nhas grown significantly in the second RBMPs. Many Member \nStates and river basin districts have invested in new or better \n\n(1) WISE Freshwater WFD visualisation tool (https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/european-waters/water-quality-and-water-assessment/\nwater-assessments).\n\n(2) More detailed information is available in the 2018 EEA report (EEA, 2018b) and the WISE Freshwater WFD visualisation tool.\n(3) This summary presents data from the second RBMPs (up to 2016), when the United Kingdom was still an EU Member State, and therefore data \n\non the UK status and pressures are included.\n(4) Compared with the results in EEA (2018b), there is an increase in the proportion of surface water bodies with high or good ecological status \n\n(from\t40\u00a0%\tto\t44\u00a0%)\tbecause\tof\tbetter-than-average\tecological\tstatus\tin\tthe\textra\tcountries\tincluded\t(Greece,\tIreland,\tLithuania\tand\tNorway).\t\nSee also Surface\twater\tbodies:\tEcological\tstatus\tor\tpotential.\n\necological and chemical monitoring programmes, with a greater \nnumber of monitoring sites and the inclusion of more chemicals \nand quality elements. Surface waters and groundwater have \nbeen\tmonitored\tat\taround\t190\u00a0000\tmonitoring\tsites.\tIn\tthe\t\nsecond RBMPs, this has resulted in both a marked reduction in \nthe proportion of water bodies with unknown status and clearly \nincreased confidence in status assessments.\n\n2.2 Surface waters: status and pressures\n\n2.2.1 Ecological status\n\nEcological status or potential is an assessment of the quality \nof the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. \nIt shows the influence of all pressures, such as pollution, \nhabitat degradation and hydrological changes, in rivers, lakes, \ntransitional waters and coastal waters. Ecological status is based \non biological quality elements and supporting physico-chemical \nand hydromorphological quality elements.\n\nOn a European scale, around 44\u00a0%\tof the surface water bodies \nare of good or high ecological status or potential, with lakes and \ncoastal waters having better status than rivers and transitional \nwaters\u00a0(4). There has been limited change in ecological status \nsince the first RBMPs were reported, although this comparison is \ndifficult to make, as the data underpinning the first RBMPs were \nof lower quality than the data for the second RBMPs. The status \nof many individual quality elements that make up ecological \nstatus is generally better than the ecological status as a whole. \nThe analysis shows that the ecological status of some biological \nquality elements improved from the first to the second RBMPs.\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/european-waters/water-quality-and-water-assessment/water-assessments\f\nStatus of and pressures on Europe\u2019s waters in the second\u00a0RBMPs\n\n18 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n2.2.2 Chemical status\n\nFor surface waters, good chemical status is defined by limits \n(environmental quality standards, EQS) on the concentration \nof certain pollutants found across the EU, known as priority \nsubstances. The second RBMPs found that 31\u00a0%\tof surface \nwater bodies are of good chemical status, while 35\u00a0%\thave not \nachieved\tgood\tchemical\tstatus;\tthe\tstatus\tof\t34\u00a0%\tof\tsurface\t\nwater\tbodies\tis\tunknown\u00a0(5).\n\nIn many Member States, relatively few substances are \nresponsible for failure to achieve good chemical status. Mercury \ncauses failure in many water bodies. If the widespread pollution \nby ubiquitous priority substances, including mercury, is omitted, \nthe proportion of water bodies with good chemical status \nincreases\tto\t64\u00a0%, with a remaining 3\u00a0%\tthat have not achieved \ngood status and 34\u00a0%\tfor\twhich\tthe\tstatus\tis\tunknown\u00a0(6). The \nmain reasons for failure to achieve good status are atmospheric \ndeposition and insufficiently treated discharges from waste \nwater treatment plants.\n\nSince the publication of the first RBMPs, Member States \nhave made progress in tackling priority substances, leading \nto a reduction in the number of water bodies failing to meet \nstandards for substances such as priority metals (including \ncadmium, lead and nickel) and pesticides.\n\n2.2.3 Pressures on surface waters\n\nThe main significant pressures on surface water bodies \nare hydromorphological pressures (affecting 34\u00a0%\tof water \nbodies),\tdiffuse\tpollution\tsources\t(33\u00a0%), particularly from \nagriculture,\tand\tatmospheric\tdeposition\t(31\u00a0%), particularly \nof\tmercury,\tfollowed\tby\tpoint\tsources\t(15\u00a0%) and water \nabstraction\u00a0(6\u00a0%)\u00a0(7). The main impacts on surface water bodies \nare\tnutrient\u00a0enrichment,\tchemical\tpollution\tand\taltered\thabitats\t\nas a result of morphological changes.\n\n2.3 Groundwater: status and pressures\n\nThe WFD requires that Member States designate separate \ngroundwater bodies and ensure that each one achieves \n'good chemical and quantitative status' (8). To meet the aim \nof good chemical status, hazardous substances should be \nprevented from entering groundwater, and the entry of all \nother pollutants (e.g. nitrates) should be limited.\n\nGood quantitative status can be achieved by ensuring that \nthe available groundwater resource is not exceeded by the \nlong-term annual average rate of abstraction. In addition, \nimpacts on surface water linked with groundwater or \ngroundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems should be \navoided, as should saline or other intrusions.\n\nIn the EU, 75\u00a0%\tand 90\u00a0%\tof the area of groundwater \nbodies are of good chemical and quantitative status, \nrespectively\u00a0(9). This is a small improvement in status from \nthe first RBMPs.\n\nNitrate is the main pollutant, affecting over 17\u00a0%\tof the area \nof groundwater bodies. In total, 170 pollutants resulted \nin failure to achieve good groundwater chemical status. \nMost of these were reported in only a few Member States, \nand\tonly\t29\u00a0pollutants\twere\treported\tby\tfive\tor\tmore\t\nMember\u00a0States.\n\nIn the EU, agriculture is the main cause of groundwater's \nfailure to achieve good chemical status, as it leads to diffuse \npollution from nitrates and pesticides. Other significant \nsources are discharges that are not connected to a \nsewerage system and contaminated sites or abandoned \nindustrial\u00a0sites.\n\nWater abstraction for public water supply, agriculture and \nindustry is the main significant cause of failure to achieve \ngood quantitative status.\n\n(5) Compared with the results in EEA (2018b), there is a marked increase in the proportion of surface water bodies with unknown chemical status \n(from\t16\u00a0%\tto\t34\u00a0%),\tbecause\tnearly\tall\tsurface\twater\tbodies\tin\tNorway\tand\tIreland\thave\tunknown\tchemical\tstatus.\tThe\thigh\tproportion\tof\t\nunknown statuses reduces the percentage with good or failing to achieve good chemical status.

See also Surface water bodies: Significant pressures.\n\n(8) See the specific criteria on chemical and quantitative status in Annex V of the WFD (EU, 2000).\n(9) Compared with the results in EEA (2018b) there are minor increases of 1 percentage point in good quantitative and good chemical status.

However, having fewer water \nbodies with unknown status increased both the proportion \nwith good status and the proportion with less than good \nstatus. The analysis of the second RBMPs shows that there \nhas been progress in the status of single quality elements  and \nsingle\u00a0pollutants.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for the limited \nimprovement\tin\tgroundwater\tand\tsurface\twater\tstatus\u00a0(11)  \nfrom the first to the second RBMPs:\n\n\u2022 First, additional biological and chemical monitoring was \nimplemented after 2009 and the classification methods \nwere improved.\n\n\u2022 Second, for some water bodies, some quality elements have \nimproved in status, but there has been no improvement in \ntheir overall ecological status.\n\n(10) Surface water ecological and chemical status and groundwater chemical and quantitative status.\n(11) 'Groundwater status' is the general expression of the status of a body of groundwater, determined by the poorer of its quantitative and \n\nchemical status. 'Surface water status' is the general expression of the status of a body of surface water, determined by the poorer of its \necological and chemical status.\n\n\u2022 Third, the second RBMPs generally show status \nclassification up to 2012/2013, and at that time many \nmeasures were only in the process of being implemented; \ntherefore, there may be a time lag before pressures are \nreduced and status improves.\n\n\u2022 Finally, some pressures may have been unknown in 2009, \nand so the measures implemented may not have been \nsufficient or as effective as expected in reducing these.\n\nIn the next chapter, the key pressures on European water \nbodies and their drivers are illustrated in more detail for \na number of selected key European water management \nchallenges. These include summaries of key measures \navailable to tackle these and reference to key management \nchallenges of EU-wide relevance (ongoing challenges and new \nchallenges\u00a0ahead).\n\f\n\u00a9 Lubica, Kremenova, WaterPix/EEA\n\f\n21Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n3\nSelected key European water \n\nmanagement challenges\n\nAs explained in Chapter 1, the selected key European water \nmanagement challenges presented in this report summarise \nEU-level evidence on the main drivers and pressures that put \nEuropean water bodies most at risk of not achieving the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD) environmental objectives and which \naffect water bodies in the second river basin management \nplans\u00a0(RBMPs).\n\nTen key European water management challenges are presented \nthat are related to pollution issues, hydromorphological \npressures, abstractions and water scarcity, and problems \nrelated to aquaculture and invasive alien species are also \npresented. These key water management challenges arise \nnot only from ongoing human activities (such as agriculture \nand energy production) but also partly from historical human \nactivities (e.g. obsolete barriers on rivers or abandoned mines) \nand new developments (e.g. new hydropower plants).\n\nThe 10 key water management challenges have been selected \nbased on the analysis of significant pressures affecting water \nbodies in the second RBMPs (see the 2018 EEA assessment of \nthe status of and pressures on European waters (EEA, 2018b). \nPressures that affect a sufficiently large share of European \nwater bodies and which are reported by many WFD countries \nwere selected. In addition, key European water management \nchallenges have been selected that have been important for \nlong enough to develop a solid knowledge and information \nbase from which to describe the scope of the issue at the \nEuropean level.\n\nAlthough some of the selected water management challenges, \nsuch as mining, navigation, aquaculture and invasive alien \nspecies, seem to affect only a small share of European water \nbodies, they do pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems in many WFD \ncountries. In addition, they can be of considerable importance \nand intensity in specific regions of Europe and contribute \nsignificantly to the failure to achieve good water status at a \nregional level.\n\nAdditional key European water management challenges may \nbe identified in the future as European data collection and \nresearch on activities and pressures that put water bodies at \nrisk of reaching the WFD objectives improve.\n\nTable 3.1 summarises the key European water management \nchallenges presented in the report.\n\nThe following sections give a brief overview of the selected \nkey European water management challenges, including:\n\n\u2022 a description of the issue (pressure types and drivers) and \ninformation on the share of WFD water bodies affected in \nthe second RBMPs;\n\n\u2022 an outline of the key impacts of the pressure types or \ndrivers on water ecosystems;\n\n\u2022 a summary of key measures that are available to \ntackle the issue and management challenges of \nEU-wide relevance (ongoing challenges and new \nchallenges\u00a0ahead).\n\nThe summary includes the main measures taken under the \nfirst and second RBMPs of the WFD as well as measures \nto meet the requirements of other relevant directives, \nregulations or national action plans that were used as \na basis for deriving information on key measures and \nmanagement\u00a0challenges.\n\nThe presentation of each key water management challenge \nis concise and limited to two pages, focusing on the main \nissues of European relevance. For more detailed information, \nthe literature cited in each section should be consulted. The \nforthcoming third RBMPs will provide further details on the \nmain drivers and pressures that are important at the river \nbasin district level and will also provide details of specific

water management challenges\n\n24 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n3.1 Pollution\n\nTo reach good ecological status of surface waters and \ngood chemical status of surface waters and groundwater, a \nreduction in water pollution is crucial and is one of the main \ntopics in water management, according to the WFD.\n\nA range of pollutants still reach European surface waters and \ngroundwater via different pathways and have high impacts on \nwater quality. Those pollutants are caused by diffuse sources \nof pollution and point sources of pollution. Whereas point \nsources have a specific discharge location, diffuse sources \ncontain many smaller sources spread over a large area. This \nis also problematic for the identification of polluters. Point \nsources from urban waste water or industry can be more \neasily addressed and managed, in contrast to diffuse pollution, \nfor which the measures may be difficult to implement.\n\nPoint source pollution is mainly caused by discharges from \nwaste water treatment plants. Over the past few decades, \nclear progress has been made in reducing emissions from \npoint sources. The implementation of the Urban Waste Water \nTreatment Directive (UWWTD) and the Industrial Emissions \nDirective (IED), together with national legislation, has led \nto improvements in waste water treatment across many \nEuropean countries.\n\nDiffuse source pollution occurs mainly from agriculture \nand run-off from urban areas, and also from atmospheric \ndeposition and non-connected dwellings. EU action on curbing \ndiffuse nutrient pollution has a long history. Member States \ncurrently use many measures, including farm-level nutrient \nplanning, fertiliser standards, appropriate tillage, nitrogen \nfixing and catch crops, buffer strips and crop rotation.\n\nAlthough recent decades have seen considerable success in \nreducing the number of pollutants discharged into Europe's \nwaters, challenges remain in terms of urban and industrial \nwaste water and diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. \nOnce released into waters, pollutants can be transported \nthrough the aquifers (groundwater) or downstream and are in \nthe end discharged into coastal waters.\n\nThe impacts of water pollution are diverse. Nutrients, such \nas phosphorus or nitrogen, lead to eutrophication with algal \nblooms and oxygen depletion, affecting fish and other aquatic \ncommunities. Pesticides, heavy metals and brominated \ndiphenyl ether (BDE; used as a flame-retardant in, for \nexample, textiles) harm the environment and human health.\n\nAccording to the second RBMPs of the WFD, 33\u00a0%\tof all surface \nwater bodies in Europe are affected by diffuse source pollution \nand\tnearly\tthe\tsame\tamount\tof\tgroundwater\tarea\u00a0(34\u00a0%). \n\nPoint source pollution affects 15\u00a0%\tof all surface water bodies \nand 14\u00a0%\tof the groundwater area.\n\nKey pressures from point source pollution and diffuse sources \nare described in the following sections. The main pressures \nfrom point sources are waste water releases from households \nand industry. For diffuse sources, the focus is on pressures \nfrom agriculture, nutrients and pesticides in particular. Other \nsectoral pressures with major impacts on aquatic ecosystems \nare non-connected dwellings (see Box 3.1 in Section 3.1.2) and \nmining. This pressure is addressed in a separate section.\n\n3.1.1 Point source pollution (urban waste \nwater,\u00a0industry)\n\nOverview\n\nPoint source pollution of surface waters relates mostly \nto discharges from urban waste water, including storm \noverflows, industrial sites and, to a much lesser extent, \naquaculture. Groundwater is mainly affected by the leaching \nof hazardous substances from landfills and contaminated sites \n(EEA, 2018b).\n\nIn Europe, point source pollution discharges have markedly \ndecreased over recent decades as a result of improved \npurification of urban waste water and reduced industrial \ndischarges. Nevertheless, point source pollution still results in \nwater pollution by oxygen-consuming substances, nutrients \nand hazardous substances with high impacts on aquatic \necosystems and human health.\n\nAccording to the second RBMPs, 15\u00a0%\tof all surface water \nbodies\tare\taffected\tby\tpoint\tsource\tpollution,\tof\twhich\t67\u00a0%\t\nare assigned to urban waste water from treatment plants \nand some 20\u00a0%\tto industrial waste water. For groundwater, \nsignificant point source pressures are present in 14\u00a0%\tof \nthe area, mainly from contaminated sites, industrial sites, \nwaste disposal sites, mining areas and urban waste water \n(EEA,\u00a02018b).\n\nMore\tthan\t30\u00a0000\tindustrial\tand\turban\twaste\twater\tfacilities\t\nin\tEurope\tdischarge\tmore\tthan\t40\u00a0000\u00a0million\u00a0m\u00b3\twaste\t\nwater every year (EC, 2018c; Van den Roovaart et al., 2017). \nThree quarters of them treat water from urban sewerage \nsystems\tthat\thave\tan\tagglomeration\tof\tmore\tthan\t2\u00a0000\t\npopulation equivalents (EC, 2019b). Of the population in EU \nMember\tStates,\t90\u00a0%\tis\tconnected\tto\tsewerage\tsystems.\tThe\t\nhighest connection rates of above 80\u00a0%\tare found in central \nand northern Europe, where the highest level of treatment \n(e.g.\u00a0nutrient\tremoval)\tis\talso\timplemented\tin\tthe\tmajority\tof\t\nwaste water treatment plants (EEA, 2020d).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n25Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nWaste water from industry has decreased over decades. This \nis caused by increased regulation (e.g. Industrial Emissions \nDirective, IED; the European Pollutant Release and Transfer \nRegister, E-PRTR), improvements in treatment and the \nimplementation of best available techniques reference \ndocuments\u00a0(12). Furthermore, the relocation of various heavily \npolluting and energy-intensive manufacturing industries to \noutside Europe has also led to water quality improvements \n(EEA, 2020a). The connection of industrial waste water to urban \nwaste water treatment plants to avoid industrial emissions to \nwater has marginally increased (EEA, 2019d). Industries that \nstill have high direct releases to water include pulp and paper, \nsteel, energy supply and chemicals; by contrast, manufacturing \nor food production tend to be more connected to urban waste \nwater treatment plants (EEA, 2019d). This is also due to the \nrecommendation made in the best available technique reference \ndocument for industrial installations (Canova et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, storm water causes problems for the sewerage \nsystem. In the event of heavy rain, overflows from combined \nsewerage systems are discharged into surface waters with a \nmixture of rainwater and untreated waste water. This can lead \nto a temporarily high pollution pressure.\n\nImpacts\n\nImpacts from point source pollution to waters are caused by \noxygen-consuming substances, indicated by the measurement \nof the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium, \nnutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, hazardous \nsubstances, emerging pollutants, pathogens (such as bacteria, \nviruses and parasites) and microplastic particles.\n\nThe BOD shows how much dissolved oxygen is needed for \nmicroorganisms to decompose the organic matter. The \nresulting oxygen deficit in highly organic polluted waters has \nan impact on aquatic communities, e.g. the loss of several \nmacroinvertebrates and the acute toxic impact on fish.\n\nOverall, concentrations of oxygen-consuming substances \n(BOD, ammonium) and nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) have \ndecreased since 1992 (Figure 3.1). The presence of nitrate as \nwell as phosphorus in rivers is not solely attributable to point \nsources of pollution. Those substances can also be released \nfrom diffuse sources.\n\nHazardous substances are defined as toxic, persistent and \nliable to bioaccumulate (Article 2 of the WFD). Some of the \npriority substances listed in Annex X of the WFD are defined \nas hazardous, for which all discharges, emissions and losses \nmust be ceased within 20 years after the adoption of cessation \nproposals by the European Parliament and the Council \n(Article 16(6) of the WFD). Those substances are, for example, \n\n4-nonylphenol, used as a surfactant, and polybrominated \ndiphenyl ethers (PBDEs), used as flame-retardants. In addition \nto the risk of hazardous substances, emerging pollutants are \npresent in low concentrations and include pharmaceuticals \nand personal care products, chemical degradation products \nand endocrine-disrupting compounds. The long-term effects \nof these pollutants and the cocktail effect in water is rather \nunknown (EEA, 2018a).\n\nThe contamination of water by faecal bacteria poses a risk \nto human health, in particular at bathing water sites or in \nwaters used for drinking water abstraction. The major sources \nof pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and \nfarmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and \nfloods as a result of sewage overflow and polluted drainage \nwater being washed into surface waters. Whereas impacts of, \nfor example, coliforms are well known, research on the risks of \nantimicrobial-resistance (AMR) in the aquatic environment is at \nan early stage.\n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nBecause of the successful implementation of the UWWTD, \npoint source pollution pressure from urban waste water has \nsignificantly decreased. This is the result of not only an increase \nin the share of the population connected to sewerage systems \nbut also the implementation of second- (biodegradation) \nand third-level (nutrient removal) treatment all over Europe \n(EEA,\u00a02020d).\n\nMeasures to further reduce point source pollution from \nurban waste water and industry include construction and \nadaptation, expansion, optimisation of existing treatment \nplants, connection of households to sewerage systems and the \nconsolidation and closure of ineffective treatment plants.\n\nImproved efforts to retain chemicals in waste water treatment \nplants should go hand in hand with clear efforts to reduce \nthem at the source. Such measures can range from raising \nconsumer awareness and encouraging industries to adjust \nthe composition of their products to, over the longer \nterm, fundamentally reviewing our use of chemicals and \nproduct\u00a0design.\n\nOne example of source-based measures is the ban on \nphosphates in consumer detergents to avoid eutrophication \nin surface waters. The remaining permitted use of phosphates \nwas legally fixed in Regulation 648/2004/EC on detergents \n(EU,\u00a02004). The European Parliament proposed a ban of \nthe use of phosphates in consumer laundry detergents \nas\tof\u00a030\u00a0June\u00a02013, with similar restrictions on consumer \nautomatic dishwasher detergents coming into force \non\u00a01\u00a0January\t2017 (EC, 2011a).\n\n(12) List of best available technique reference documents as part of the IED (https://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference).\n\nhttps://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n26 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nFurthermore, measures can be assigned to achieve stricter \nrequirements, such as lower targets for concentrations of \nspecific pollutants in the waste water discharged by the \nresponsible authority. This has been applied at Lake Constance \nto protect its drinking water resources. All treatment plants \non the tributaries flowing into the lake markedly reduced the \nphosphorous concentrations in their waste water discharges. \nLake Constance has been at good ecological status with \nhigh drinking water quality since the introduction of the \nrequirements (IGKB, 2021).\n\nAlthough considerable success has been achieved in \nreducing the discharge of pollutants from point sources, \nmore emphasis is needed to protect water quality and \nhuman health. Despite varying conditions such as the density \nof population in and economic background of European \ncountries, treatment must be further improved in the eastern \n\nBOD5 (506 monitoring sites)\n\nAmmonium (693 monitoring sites)\n\nNitrate (966 monitoring sites)\n\nOrthophosphate (742 monitoring sites)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nIndex (1992 = 100)\n\n1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\nFigure 3.1 Trends in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonium, orthophosphate and nitrates in \nEuropean rivers\n\nSources: EEA (2020b, 2020c). \n\nparts of Europe in particular. Nature-based solutions can \nbe used to help reduce discharges from storm overflows. \nTo improve treatment, the implementation of a fourth \ntreatment level is in progress. This consists of innovative \ntreatment\ttechniques\t(e.g.\u00a0oxidation\twith\tozone,\tactivated\t\ncarbon filtration, membrane filtration) (UBA, 2014, \nEEA,\u00a02019f).\tFor\texample,\tby\t2040,\u00a0100\tof\tthe\t700\twaste\t\nwater treatment plants in Switzerland will be equipped with \na fourth level of treatment.

A driver for nutrient surpluses in soil and water \npollution is the excess use of fertiliser for crop production \ncoming from mineral fertilisers and manure from livestock \nfarming. Nutrients (as well as pesticides) enter the water cycle \nthrough erosion, surface run-off, leaching or inflow from \npolluted drainage and groundwater to surface waters, which \nhas an impact on water quality, aquatic communities and \nhuman health. In the second RBMPs, Member States identified \nthat diffuse pollution from agriculture affects 22\u00a0%\tof surface \nwater bodies and 28\u00a0%\tof the groundwater area, leading to \nfailure of good ecological and chemical status.\n\nNutrients are key for plant growth. In the EU, the \nnitrogen surplus from agriculture is estimated to total \napproximately\u00a027\u00a0million\ttonnes\tper\tyear\t(Misselbrook et al., \n2019).\tNitrogen\tsurpluses\tdecreased\tby\t10\u00a0%\tbetween\t2004\t\nand 2015 (ESTAT,\u00a02021). Today, the highest total nitrogen \nsurpluses occur generally, although not exclusively, in western \nEurope.\n\nBased on reported long-term data for nitrates in European \nwaters, nitrate concentration in rivers showed a decreasing \ntrend (Figure 3.1). The decline reflects the effects of \nimprovements in waste water treatment and reductions in \nagricultural inputs. In contrast to rivers, nitrate concentration \nin groundwater has not shown any trend during recent \ndecades (EEA, 2020b).\n\nPesticides are used to prevent or control any pest causing \nharm to agricultural products (FAO, 2002). Pesticide \nsales data in Europe show that, in the period 20112016,\tpesticide\tsales\tamounted\tto\t400\u00a0000\ttonnes\tper\t\nyear (EEA, 2018d). Despite tonnes of pesticides used, \n0.4\u00a0%\tof all surface water bodies and 6.5\u00a0%\tof the \ngroundwater area fail to achieve good chemical status \nbased on exceedances of environmental quality standards \naccording to the status assessments in the second RBMPs. \nReporting data for European surface water monitoring \nsites, based on Waterbase Water Quality, suggest that in \nthe\tperiod\u00a02007-2017,\t5-15\u00a0%\tshowed exceedances for \nherbicides and 3-8\u00a0%\tfor insecticides. For groundwater, the \npercentages were about 7\u00a0%\tfor herbicides and below 1\u00a0%\t\n\nfor insecticides. Exceedances of fungicides seemed to be \nless prevalent for both surface waters and groundwater \n(Mohaupt et al., 2020).\n\nAtmospheric deposition plays a role as a diffuse source \nof water pollution with chemicals, such as mercury and \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAH emissions \noccur during all combustion processes involving organic \nmaterials, such as wood, coal and oil. Mercury is released \ninto the atmosphere, mainly by coal combustion, spreading \nover great distances and washing out in rain to soil and \nwaters (BMU/UBA, 2016). It can accumulate in biota, \nespecially fish, which is a risk for fish-eating animals and is \nalso a potential risk for human health (Zupo et al., 2019). In \nEurope, mercury from atmospheric deposition is the main \nreason for failing to achieve good chemical status in more \nthan 30\u00a0%\tof all surface water bodies (EEA, 2018b).\n\nImpacts\n\nNutrients and pesticides release from agriculture as well as \nsediment run-off have a high impact on surface waters and \ngroundwater. The presence of too many nutrients leads to \neutrophication with high levels of algae and aquatic plant \ngrowth. In lakes, high nutrient concentrations can induce \npotentially toxic blue-green algae proliferation, which can \nbe detrimental to human health (Image 3.1). Coastal water \nbodies show similar reactions to excessive nutrient inputs \n(Ibisch et al., 2016).\n\nElevated groundwater nitrate concentrations affect water \nfor drinking water abstraction and thus create a risk to \nhuman health. Groundwater that contains nitrates can also \naffect surface water bodies that are fed by groundwater \n(BMU/\u00a0UBA,\t2016).\n\nPesticide inputs can have impacts on aquatic communities if \nthey are directly exposed to pesticide inflows from farmland \nthrough erosion or indirectly through the trophic chain \n(Hasenbein et al., 2016; Maksymiv, 2015). Furthermore, \naquatic communities are exposed to mixtures of different \npesticide substances. Knowledge of the combined effects \nof these mixtures on the aquatic environment is scarce \n(Mohaupt et al., 2020).\n\nSediment run\u2011off from agricultural fields can result in the \naccumulation of fine sediments (see Box 3.2 in Section 3.2), \nwhich overlay the natural riverbed, resulting in the loss of \nhabitats (e.g. spawning ground for trout and salmon).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n28 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nMember States are implementing different kinds of measures \nto reduce nutrient pollution from agriculture. Those measures \ninclude imposing restrictions on organic fertiliser application \n(e.g. up to 170\u00a0kg\u00a0N/ha at the farm level, in compliance \nwith the Nitrates Directive), restrictions on the application \nconditions for mineral and organic fertiliser and restrictions on \nthe amount applied of certain types of fertiliser during specific \nperiods (e.g. no spreading of manure during winter). Some \nMember States have limited the total nitrogen applications \nfor all crops, to inform farmers about their obligations and \nto facilitate progress in implementing the Nitrates Directive \n(EC,\u00a02019a). To further improve efficient nutrient use, the \nEU Farm to Fork strategy includes integrated nutrient \nmanagement action plans to tackle nutrient pollution at the \nsource and to reduce pollution from fertilisers by 50\u00a0%\tand \nreduce their use by 20\u00a0%\t(EC, 2020c).\n\nFurther strategies to reduce diffuse nutrient pollution are \nexpanding the scope of organic farming, the use of precision \nfarming with new digital technologies and innovative \nmonitoring concepts (e.g. remote sensing), and the reduction \nof livestock density. Technical measures include catch cropping, \nthe use of ground cover crops and tillage methods, the \nestablishment of buffer strips with strict restriction on use and \nincreasing manure storage capacity at the farm level. Manure \nstorage can improve the timing of application of manure \nto minimise the risk of excessive leaching into the water \nenvironment. Advisory services can lead to better informed \nfarmers, as a result of having practical and relevant information, \nand an increase in their acceptance of measures.\n\nImage 3.1 Toxic blue\u2011green algal bloom in a reservoir\n\nSource: \u00a9 J. V\u00f6lker.\n\nTo reduce pesticide pollution, relevant measures include \nminimising the risk of off-site pollution caused by spray drift, \ndrain-flow and run-off, and reducing or eliminating applications \nclose to surface water or groundwater. Other measures include \nusing pesticides that are not classified as dangerous for the \naquatic environment, establishing untreated buffer zones and \nimplementing a ban or restriction on the use of pesticides. Some \nEuropean countries (Denmark, France, Sweden and the United \nKingdom) use reduction targets and timelines within national \npesticide action plans to achieve a stepwise reduction in pesticide \nuse (EC and Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, 2017).\n\nAlthough water quality has improved over recent decades, \npollution from diffuse sources, in particular agriculture, remains \na severe water management problem in Europe and is a major \ncause of failing good ecological and chemical status of surface \nwaters and groundwater. To protect water ecosystems, there \nwill be a need to strengthen the implementation of agricultural \nmeasures (both basic and supplementary) (EC, 2019a). This also \nincludes a wider uptake of sustainable management practices, \nsuch as organic farming, and nature-based solutions with multiple \nbenefits (see Section 4.5), the implementation and integration of \nEU policies with incentives and the prioritisation of funding within \nthe reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) (EEA, 2021).\n\nSpecific implementation challenges also remain in addressing \nwater quality issues in 'hotspots' with high nutrient loads as a \nresult of farming, through better coordination of \nnational/regional sectoral administrations (e.g. agriculture, \nwater) and balanced fertiliser application (EC, 2017b). Still, basic \nmeasures need to be more strictly implemented to fully comply \nwith the Nitrates Directive (EEA 2018b, 2019c).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n29Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nBox 3.1 Non\u2011connected dwellings\n\nNon-connected dwellings are a diffuse source pollution pressure caused by discharge from households not connected to \nsewerage systems and urban waste water treatment plants or other collection systems.\n\nIn 2017, 11\u00a0%\tof the European population (approximately 50 million people) were not connected to waste water collection \nsystems, with the highest shares located in the eastern part of Europe (Eurostat, 2021). Based on the second river basin \nmanagement plans, 21 Water Framework Directive (WFD) countries reported significant diffuse source pollution pressures \ncaused by discharges not connected to sewerage systems in 10\u00a0%\tof all surface water bodies. Furthermore, about 7.5\u00a0%\tof \nall groundwater area is affected by this pressure.\n\nIf the waste water is not properly treated, discharges of untreated waste water to waters can lead to nutrient inputs or \nthe presence of lots of disease-causing organisms with potential risks for human health in, for example, bathing waters \n(EEA,\u00a02019f).\n\nMeasures to reduce water pollution are mainly technical and include waste water package plants, sand filters, drain fields, \nseepage pits and constructed wetlands with varying purification efficiencies (Vorne et al., 2019). Furthermore, national \nregulatory frameworks have been developed to require the installation of appropriate treatment systems; for example, in \nBulgaria it is required that the water is collected and treated within watertight cesspools (Grebot et al., 2019). However, the \ninstallation of treatment systems, monitoring and maintenance are mainly the responsibility of homeowners, and technical \nor financial support from local, regional or national authorities is rather rare. This makes it difficult to enforce those \ntreatment techniques in single houses or small agglomerations.\n\nThere is still a huge knowledge gap on the impacts of discharges from non-connected dwellings, because neither the Urban \nWaste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) nor the WFD directly regulate mitigation measures, and reporting obligations \nsolely\taddress\tconnected\tdwellings\tof\tmore\tthan\t2\u00a0000\tpopulation\tequivalents.\tThis\thinders\tthe\tgathering\tof\tinformation\t\nand the drawing of conclusions on the implementation, use and effectiveness of individual technical treatment systems. \nThere is a need to further improve our knowledge of this issue, to adapt and harmonise WFD and UWWTD measures and \nreporting, and to control implemented techniques and to provide more financial support for homeowners (EC 2019b; \nGrebot, et al., 2019). \n\n3.1.3 Mining\n\nOverview\n\nMining has been undertaken in Europe for many hundreds \nof years. Many mines are now closed, but both working and \nabandoned mines still affect the quantitative, chemical and \necological quality of water. The main pressures and impacts \ninclude acid run-off caused by lowering the pH, which may \nresult in the discharge of heavy metals, other chemical \npollution, saltwater intrusion, an alteration in flow or the \nlowering of the water table, caused by excessive dewatering \nduring mine operations or after mining activities have stopped. \nThe recovery of affected aquatic ecosystems \u2014 including \ngroundwater \u2014 may take decades.\n\nIn the second RBMPs, 17 WFD countries reported mining as \nsignificant point and/or diffuse source pollution pressures, \naffecting\tapproximately\t1\u00a0100\tsurface\twater\tbodies\t(less\t\nthan\u00a01\u00a0%\tout of all surface water bodies) and 7.5\u00a0%\tof the whole \ngroundwater area. Countries with high shares of reported \npressures from mining include Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, \nItaly, Norway and the United Kingdom.\n\nOther analyses of mining pressures and their potential risks to \nwater show a slightly different picture on account of the use of \n\nother sources of data from existing and abandoned mine activities; \nthose show that Czechia, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, \nSpain, Sweden and the United Kingdom have the highest potential \nrisk of mining pressures (Briere and Turrell, 2012).\n\nMining activities include the extraction of coal and \nlignite, minerals (mainly potassium, rock salt and \nmagnesium-containing minerals), clay, peat, metals (such as \ncopper and gold), shale oil and gas as well as the extraction \nof stones, gravel and sand (aggregates). It is estimated that \nin\tthe\tEU\tmore\tthan\t32\u00a0000\tmining\tsites\texist,\tof\twhich\tmore\t\nthan\t25\u00a0000\tare\tused\tfor\tthe\textraction\tof\taggregates,\twith\tthe\t\nhighest number of sites in Poland and Germany. There are \nsome\t1\u00a0400\tpeat\textraction\tsites\tin\tthe\tEU,\tof\twhich\t75\u00a0%\tare \nlocated in Finland (Garbarino et al., 2018).\n\nEurope-wide data on the number of abandoned mines are rare \n(EC, 2017a) and the number of abandoned mines is likely to be \nmuch higher than that of active ones based on available data for \ncertain countries, such as Slovakia and Hungary. Slovakia has \nregistered\tmore\tthan\t17\u00a0000\tabandoned\tmines\tand\tHungary\thas\t\nreported\tsome\t6\u00a0000\tabandoned\tmining\tsites\t(UNCCD,\u00a02000). \nThe bulk of mine water problems in Europe are associated with \nabandoned mining sites, and in numerous catchments the \nsingle greatest cause of freshwater pollution is pollution from \nabandoned mines (ERMITE-Consortium et al., 2004).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n30 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nImpacts\n\nDifferent types of mining, such as surface and underground \nmining, placer mining and hydraulic fracturing, have \ngreat effects on aquatic ecosystems, including changes in \ngroundwater and surface water hydrology, reduction of water \nquality, alteration in stream morphology and habitats, and \nchanges in sediment dynamics (Figure 3.2).\n\nGroundwater hydrology, which in turn can affect surface \nwaters that are in hydraulic continuity with the affected \ngroundwater systems, is affected by surface and underground \nmining in particular (ERMITE-Consortium et al., 2004). This is \nmainly due to dewatering, resulting in a depression of the water \ntable around the dewatered zone.\n\nThe water quality of mining activities is mainly affected by \nacid mine drainage or salinisation. The acid run-off further \ndissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury into \ngroundwater or surface water. Problems that can be associated \nwith mine drainage include iron hydroxide precipitation during \nthe oxygenation of mining water, contaminated drinking \nwater (e.g. with metals or sulphate), impacts on aquatic plants \nand animals and the corroding effects of the acid on parts \nof infrastructure (Hutson, 2004). Salinisation is caused by \nthe extraction of salts, e.g. potassium, and by the discharge \nof highly mineralised groundwater from coal mines. Aquatic \ncommunities altered by high salt content and salt intrusion into \nthe groundwater can endanger the quality of drinking water.\n\nHydraulic fracturing to extract shale oil or shale gas also poses \na risk for water quality. It potentially threatens drinking water \nresources (mainly groundwater) as a result of contamination \n\nwith chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Surface \nwater contamination can occur if the waste water, containing \nthe chemical additives as well as saline water and naturally \noccurring heavy metals and radioactive materials from the shale \nformations, is not properly managed and treated (UBA,\u00a02012). \nIn the example of an Estonian oil shale basin, impacts on the \nhydrological regime and the high sulphate concentration affect \ngroundwater and surface waters. Furthermore, some wells \nused for drinking water supply dried up as a result of oil shale \nwater abstraction or the water was not suitable as drinking \nwater due to low water quality (OECD/ECLAC, 2017).\n\nPlacer mining leads to changes in sediment dynamics and it \nalso decreases water clarity. Furthermore, stream morphology \nand habitats are affected by the replacement of coarse \nsubstrates, such as gravels and boulders, resulting in an impact \non, for example, invertebrate species.\n\nImpacts of the removal of peat are increased sedimentation, \nincreasing dissolved organic carbon and phosphoros \nconcentrations and decreasing pH values in the receiving \nwaters (Lundin et al., 2017; Ramchunder et al., 2012). The \nleaching of phosphorus and nitrogen causes eutrophication \nproblems in the watercourses or downstream lakes and the \nload of solid peat particles causes silting of downstream water \nbodies.\n\nMining accidents can have tremendous impacts on the aquatic \nenvironment; an example is the spill of cyanide-rich waste \nwater in Baia Mare, Romania, in 2000. After a dam broke in the \nretreatment plant of a gold-mining company, a large number \nof fish were killed in the Somes, Tisza and Danube rivers. \nFurthermore, drinking water resources were contaminated. \n\nFigure 3.2  Impacts of mining activity types on water\n\nNotes: Surface mining: removal of plants, soil and bedrock from the surface to be able to access shallow deposits. Underground mining: \ndigging down into the Earth's surface and creating tunnels and shafts to reach deeper deposits of resources. Placer mining: generally \ndone in riverbeds, sands or other sedimentary environments to extract stones, gravel or sand. In situ mining: pumping chemicals \nunderground to dissolve resource-containing ore and pumping back the enriched liquid to the surface for further processing. Hydraulic \nfracturing: cracks in and below the Earth's surface are opened and widened by injecting water, chemicals and sand at high pressure to \nextract shale oil or gas from deep Earth layers. \n\nSources: Smith (2019); National Geographic (2021).\n\nSurface mining Underground mining Placer mining In situ mining Hydraulic fracturing\n\nChanges in surface water \nand groundwater hydrology\n\nReduction of \nwater quality\n\nAlteration in stream \nmorphology and habitats\n\nChanges in sediment \ndynamics\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n31Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nMeasures to reduce pressures from mining activities on \nsurface waters include reusing or recycling excess water, \ndiverting run-off systems and using reagents or chemicals \nwith a low environmental impact, as well as using drainage \nsystems, removing suspended solids or liquid particles and \nremoving dissolved substances by, for example, adsorption \nor nanofiltration. For groundwater, physical barriers, drainage \nsystems or covering techniques are listed as effective measures \nto protect aquatic ecosystems (Garbarino et al., 2018). For \nexample, to reduce diffuse discharge from saline waters into \ngroundwater, the K+S company in Germany covers the salt \ntailing piles and uses chemical transformation processes to \ntreat the waste water. It is estimated that this will reduce the \nproportion of saline waste water by 20\u00a0%\t(K+S, 2021). These \nmeasures are part of the best available techniques for the \nmanagement of waste from extractive industries, which need to \nbe implemented in EU Member States targeted by the Extractive \nWaste Directive (EWD; 2006/21/EC). According to Article 5 of the \nEWD, operators must submit an extractive waste management \nplan (EWMP) as part of their permit applications.\n\nAfter the closure of mines, restoration is envisaged to mitigate \nthe impacts of former activities on soil and water. Many \ncountries have national plans, such as the environmental \nmonitoring programme and rehabilitation plan for the Avoca \nriver in Ireland (Department of Communications, Energy \nand Natural Resources, 2014) and the Landscape evaluation \ntool for open-pit mine design in Greece (Mavrommatis and \nMenegaki,\u00a02017). In Germany, numerous post-mining lakes \nwere created as part of the refurbishment of former brown coal \nmines. Most of these lakes are already being used for tourism \npurposes (Deshaies, 2020).\n\nCurrent mining activities are strongly regulated by Member \nStates under national laws. In most countries, water acts \nand water laws include the protection of waters from mining \nactivities. Additional legislation and regulations are implemented \nfor the protection of groundwater, e.g. the decree on activities \nthat affect the quality of groundwater in Hungary and the \nGroundwater\tExploration\tAct\tin\tSweden\t(Endl\tand\tBerger,\u00a02016).\t\nThe legislative instruments on international and national levels \nregulating the current mining sector should ensure that the \nobjectives of the WFD (2000/60/EC) and the Groundwater \nDirective (2006/118/EC) are achieved (Briere and Turrell, 2012).\n\nMeasures under the WFD also aim to reduce water abstraction \nrelated to mining, which is commonly used to control \nquantitative impacts from quarrying activities but could also be \nof use for underground mining. \n\nData on measures implemented under the WFD and the \nEWD are scarce. In the context of the WFD, information on \nmining is part of different reporting obligations, e.g. WFD \nemissions inventory, pressure characterisation of water bodies \nand the exceedance of environmental quality standards for, \n\nfor example, heavy metals as a result of mining activities. If \nmining activities cause significant pressures, putting at risk \nthe achievement of the WFD objectives for surface water or \ngroundwater, measures need to be included in the RBMPs. \nIn the context of the EWD, mining operators must draw up \nan EWMP as part of permit applications. Among other issues, \nEWMPs should cover the monitoring of surface water and \ngroundwater quantity and quality and the management of \nexcavated material as well as mining waste (EC, 2019f). Because \nof the relevance of both directives (WFD and EWD) to the \nassessment and management of water risks due to mining, a \nmore synergistic way of gathering information and developing \nmanagement strategies and measures for mining activities \nwould be beneficial.\n\n3.2 Hydromorphological pressures\n\nFor decades, humans have altered the shape of water bodies \nand the flow of river courses to farm the land, facilitate \nnavigation, generate energy and protect settlements and \nagricultural land against flooding. For these purposes, rivers \nhave been straightened, channelised and disconnected from \ntheir floodplains; land has been reclaimed, dams and weirs \nhave been built, embankments have been reinforced and \ngroundwater levels have changed. These activities have resulted \nin altered habitats, changed flows, interruptions in river \ncontinuity, loss of floodplain connectivity and severe impacts \non the status of the aquatic environment. These changes have \ncaused damage to the morphology and hydrology of the water \nbodies, i.e. to their hydromorphology (EEA, 2018b, 2019a).\n\nHydromorphology plays a key role in aquatic ecosystems. For \nexample, water flow and substrate provide physical habitats \nfor plants and animals, such as fish and benthic invertebrates. \nGood hydromorphological functioning is an essential element \nof ecosystem health and underpins the delivery of many \necosystem services and benefits for society (EPA Catchment \nUnit 2016; Houlden, 2018).\n\nIn the second RBMPs, hydromorphological pressures are \nthe most commonly occurring pressure on surface waters, \naffecting\u00a034\u00a0%\tof all such water bodies (see Chapter 2 of this \nreport). The most frequently reported hydromorphological \npressures are physical alterations related to flood protection, \nurbanisation, agricultural development and navigation, and \nbarriers, including dams and weirs, built for different purposes \n(hydropower, flood protection, irrigation or navigation). In \naddition, several thousands of water bodies are affected by \nhydrological alterations driven by water abstractions (for \npublic water supply, agriculture or industry) and reservoirs \nused mainly for hydropower and irrigation. However, in the \nsecond RBMPs of most Member States, the hydromorphological \npressures identified are not clearly apportioned to specific \ndrivers\t(EC,\u00a02019a). Furthermore, 16\u00a0%\tof European water \nbodies\thave\tbeen\tdesignated\tas\theavily\tmodified\t(13\u00a0%) or \nartificial\t(3\u00a0%)\twater\u00a0bodies.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/open-pit-mine\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n32 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nKey hydromorphological pressures are described in the \nfollowing sections of this report, which elaborate on the role \nof hydropower, navigation, flood protection and agricultural \ndrainage as major drivers of impacts on hydromorphology \nin Europe. Separate sections address the role of barriers \nto illustrate their very dense distribution and far-reaching \nimpacts on the European river network and key issues \nrelated to the loss of lateral connectivity to floodplains.\n\nCertain aspects of hydromorphological pressures and impacts \nare less well known in terms of their extent and implications \n\nBox 3.2 Sediment quantity and hydromorphology \n\nSediments and sediment transport are essential and integral natural elements of the hydromorphology of rivers, lakes, \nestuarine and coastal systems. Sediments are also vital to the ecology of these systems, providing and supporting habitats \nand nutrients for aquatic plants, invertebrates, fish and other organisms. Although the Water Framework Directive (WFD) \ndoes not explicitly take account of sediments, ecological status is clearly dependent on habitat (including sediment \nquantity), and a clearer understanding is needed of the role of sediments in the WFD and related legislation, such as the \nFloods Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.\n\nThe management of most European rivers by humans has resulted in substantial modifications to natural sediment transport \nprocesses, sometimes with dramatic consequences for the stability of rivers and coastlines (SedNet, 2014). Dams act as \nbarriers in the hydrological system, as they interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through river systems. Sediments \ntrapped in reservoirs cause a deficit of sediments downstream of reservoirs, leading to erosion and morphological and \necological consequences in the downstream rivers (Kondolf et al., 2014). Furthermore, the dredging of sediment, which \nis necessary to maintain and develop ports or navigable waterways, can increase tidal floods and damage ecology by \ndirectly affecting physical habitats, disrupting riverine processes and reducing connectivity with the floodplain (England and \nBurgess-Gamble, 2013).\n\nThe relevance of sediments for achieving fundamental management goals in river basins is obvious. However, the \nperceived complexity often hinders the full integration of sediment issues into river basin management (SedNet, 2017). The \nWFD takes a river basin scale approach to water management, which is well aligned with the need to manage sediments at \nthis scale, through the development of sediment management plans, rather than locally, as has been the case traditionally. \nHowever, to date, most European countries do not have sediment management plans in place (Dworak and Kampa, 2019).\n\nSome major European river basin commissions have taken up the challenge of working towards transboundary sediment \nmanagement plans as part of river basin management planning, such as the Rhine and Danube commissions (Brils, 2008). \nIn addition, in the Elbe, a comprehensive sediment management concept has been developed in support of management \nplanning in a large international river basin, serving as an inspiring example on how to integrate sediments in river basin \nmanagement (SedNet, 2017). A transboundary dimension in sediment management plans, beyond national borders, is \nimportant so that national plans are coordinated and have similar levels of ambition within transboundary catchments.\n\non the European scale. One of these aspects is the issue of \nchanged sediment dynamics due to hydromorphological \npressures; this is gaining more and more attention and will \nrequire targeted management interventions soon (see Box \n3.2). In the meantime, the sediment issue should remain in \nfocus of further data collection and research to identify the \nmain underlying processes, impacts on water bodies and \nappropriate management approaches.\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n33Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nThe WFD explicitly requires Member States to manage \nthe effects on the ecological status of water that result \nfrom changes to physical characteristics of water bodies. It \nrequires action in those cases in which hydromorphological \nmodifications are having an impact on the ecological status, \ninterfering with the ability to achieve the WFD's objectives \nand to avoid deterioration due to new modifications. The \nrestoration of hydromorphological conditions can take place \nusing a wide range of measures, such as removing river \nobstacles to restore river continuity, setting ecological flow \nrequirements, improving physical habitats in rivers and on \ntheir floodplains, and implementing natural water retention \nmeasures. The EU biodiversity strategy (EC, 2020b), one of \nmany initiatives under the European Green Deal, which was \nadopted in 2020, encourages EU Member States to restore \nfreshwater ecosystems, floodplains and free-flowing rivers.\n\nAt the same time, WFD measures to address \nhydromorphological pressures should not be taken in \nisolation; it is beneficial, in terms of the effects to be achieved \nand the funding opportunities that are available, to coordinate \nthe planning of WFD measures with the planning process \nfor other sectors (e.g. planning for the energy, transport and \nagricultural sectors) (EC 2019a).\n\n3.2.1 Barriers\n\nOverview\n\nHumans have fragmented European water bodies with \nartificial barriers such as dams and weirs for centuries, as \na means of ensuring water supplies, generating energy, \nfacilitating navigation and controlling flooding. Such \nhuman-made barriers (1) reduce the ecological connectivity \nof a water body, impeding the flows of water, nutrients \nand sediment; (2) obstruct species movement (particularly \nmigratory species); (3) often alter the quantity, quality and \ntiming of river flows, both upstream and downstream; \nand\u00a0(4)\tcan\taffect\tsurrounding\triparian\tzones\tand\tfloodplains\t\n(Freshwater Information System, 2019).\n\nThere are different types of barriers, including dams, sluices, \nweirs, culverts, fords and ramp-bed sills, and the extent \nto which these are recorded in the different national river \nassessment systems across Europe differs.\n\nIn the second RBMPs, barriers are a significant pressure for \nalmost 30 000 surface water bodies (20\u00a0%\tof total number) \nin WFD countries, with the highest numbers being reported \nin Sweden, Germany, Austria, France, Denmark and Spain. \nFurthermore, barriers are the reason, or one of the reasons, \nfor designating approximately 10 000 water bodies as heavily \nmodified, which amounts to more than half of all heavily \nmodified water bodies in Europe.\n\nMany barriers are reported in the RBMPs to be used for \nhydropower (dams for hydropower production), flood \nprotection and irrigation (water storage reservoirs). However, \nfor\ta\tlarge\tshare\tof\twater\tbodies\taffected\tby\tbarriers\t(ca.\u00a040 %), \nthe purposes of the barriers are unclear, as they are either \nunknown or not explicitly reported or obsolete. Indeed, many \nbarriers on European rivers originated between the 10th \nand\u00a019th centuries to operate mills, and a high proportion of \nthese are now redundant. It is estimated that in just France, \nPoland, Spain and the United Kingdom, there are up to 30 000, \nmainly small, dams that are now obsolete (Gough et al., 2018). \nIn addition, there are many weirs without a practical use.\n\nThe most comprehensive overview of river fragmentation in \nEurope is provided by the Pan-European Atlas of In-stream \nBarriers (Amber Barrier Atlas; see Map 3.1), which was \npublished in 2020 (AMBER Consortium, 2020). The atlas \ncontains information on 630 000 barriers, including not \nonly large dams, but also hundreds of thousands of smaller \nweirs, ramps, fords and culverts. However, researchers have \nrecently shown that the actual number of barriers is much \nhigher, amounting to at least 1.2 million instream barriers \nin\u00a036\u00a0European\tcountries,\twith\ta\tmean\tdensity\tof\u00a00.74\t\nbarriers per kilometre (Belletti et al., 2020). This scale of \nriver fragmentation is alarming and makes Europe the most \nfragmented river landscape in the world, with hardly any \nunfragmented, free-flowing rivers left (WWF, 2020).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n34 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nImpacts\n\nArtificial barriers such as dams, weirs and other impounding \nstructures typically have the following negative effects on the \nenvironment of rivers:\n\n\u2022 Habitat loss.

The most \ncommon measures planned in this respect include the building \nof fish ladders and bypass channels, the removal of artificial \nstructures such as barriers and the setting of ecological flows \nand measures for sediment management.\n\nThe implementation of such measures is linked to the \nenvironmental objective of the WFD to restore continuity \nfor migrating species in regulated rivers. Several other EU \npolicies also support the restoration of river continuity and \nthe rehabilitation of surface waters that are affected by \nbarriers, including the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive \n(EU,\u00a01992),\tthe\tnew\tEU\tbiodiversity\tstrategy\tfor\t2030\t(EC,\t2020b)\t\nand the Eel Regulation (EU, 2007a).

Some national and regional strategies for \nrestoring continuity are in place to ensure a phased approach \nin dealing with the issue of barriers. Examples are the Benelux \ntreaty on free fish migration (adopted in 1996), continuity \nrestoration initiatives in the international river basins of the \nRhine (WFF and ERN, 2016) and the Danube (Shepherd, 2012) \nand national programmes and priority networks for river \ncontinuity restoration in specific countries such as Austria, \nFinland, France and Germany (Kampa et al., 2017; Ollikainen \nand Vilhunen, 2019).\n\nThe implementation of measures is affected by significant \ngaps in our knowledge concerning barriers, their abundance, \ndistribution in the European river network (especially of small \nbarriers) and their ecological effects. The recent European \nproject AMBER (see above) has summarised much of the \nneeded basic information. Furthermore, knowledge still \nneeds to be consolidated on the effects of some of the key \nmeasures. For instance, barrier removal is increasingly viewed \nas a necessary management measure to reinstate natural \nconnectivity. However, we so far have insufficient knowledge to \nmake predictions about the geomorphological and biological \ntrajectory of a river system once a barrier has been removed \n(Birnie-Gauvin et al., 2017). \n\nAn additional implementation challenge arises from the large \nnumber of barriers with an unknown or obsolete use. Funding \nmeasures to make obsolete barriers passable is a challenge, \nbecause of the lack of a specific water use sector assigned to \nthese modifications in the rivers.\n\nIn parallel to planning measures for dealing with the impacts \nof existing barriers, new barriers and dams are being built \nelsewhere in Europe, driven by policies for energy production, \ntransport,\tflood\tprotection\tand\tsecuring\twater\tsupply\t(e.g.\u00a0new\t\nhydropower plants in the Western Balkans (WWF et al., 2019). \n\nflows, changing seasonal flow patterns, regulating low \nflows or other regulatory practices. Flow regulation may \nhave significant negative effects on fish fauna and benthic \ninvertebrate communities.\n\n\u2022 Fragmentation. Rivers are transformed into a series of \nponded sections; dams block migration routes for fish in \nboth upstream and downstream directions, and habitats \nare isolated through fragmentation. This transforms natural \nfish fauna and leads to the local extinction of fish species \n(Gough et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 Sediment. Dams block the transport of sediments in rivers, \nleading to accumulations and poor water quality in the \nreservoir, deprivation of sand and gravels downstream of \ndams, a higher risk of erosion downstream of dams and in \nriver deltas and a decrease in habitat quality upstream and \ndownstream of the dam (Gough et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 Water quality. Storage of organic material and nutrients in \nreservoirs, and also in backwater from smaller dams, often \nleads to a decrease in water quality, changes in temperature \nand the capacity to dissolve oxygen, and sometimes to \nseasonal stratification (Gough et al., 2018). Ponded sections \nhave a longer water residence time, thus enhancing \neutrophication effects such as phytoplankton blooms.\n\nThe impacts of barriers vary according to their height and \nlocation. A major impact on a river could be caused by a single, \nvery damaging, structure or by accumulated effects throughout \nthe length of the river of a series of small structures, which may \nhave only a small impact individually (EEA 2018b). The location \nof barriers in a catchment determines, to a large extent, \nthe impacts on sediment fluxes and fluvial habitats, such as \nfloodplains and deltas, and on the abundance and diversity of \nfreshwater biota. For example, barriers in lowlands can prevent \nor delay fish migration, while headwater barriers can alter \ndownstream flows and sediment transport (Jones et al., 2019).\n\nThe height of barriers also plays a major role in determining the \nimpacts on freshwater biota and the surrounding ecosystem. \nHigh-head\tstructures\t(large\tstructures),\ttypically\ttaller\tthan\u00a08 m \nor 15 m, often create large impoundments, which can cause \nshifts in the composition of biota communities within the \nreservoir as well as downstream. Low-head structures (small \nstructures) can also affect key ecological processes just as \nstrongly. Because of their large number, small structures \nare likely to cause greater cumulative impacts and a more \nsignificant loss of river connectivity than high-head structures \n(Jones et al., 2019).\n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nIn the first RBMPs, several European countries had already \nplanned measures to improve the ecological condition of \nrivers affected by barriers. The planning of measures in the \nsecond RBMPs indicated substantial further effort to improve \n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n36 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nIn this respect, a much closer coordination of river basin \nmanagement planning under the WFD and the planning of new \nriver infrastructure to serve sectoral development is essential to \nsafeguard river continuity.\n\n3.2.2 Loss of lateral connectivity (flood protection \nand\u00a0drainage on floodplains)\n\nOverview\n\nWetlands and floodplains play a particularly important \nrole in the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. By \nproviding habitats for the life stages of aquatic organisms, \nthey are significant in ensuring or achieving the good \necological status of adjacent water bodies. Wetlands and \nfloodplains also play a significant role in flood retention \n(EEA, 2018b).\n\nStudies have shown, however, that 70-90\u00a0%\tof European \nfloodplains have been environmentally degraded because of \nstructural flood protection, river straightening, disconnection \nof floodplain wetlands from the river, agricultural land use \nand urbanisation over the past two centuries. The largest \npressures on floodplains are hydromorphological pressures \nand those arising from land use and pollution (EEA, 2019a).\n\nFlood protection structures play a key role in this context. \nFlood events in degraded floodplains with little buffering \ncapacity and space for flood retention are one of the most \ncommon and most dangerous natural hazards affecting \nEuropean society (EEA, 2016a). For decades, European \ncountries have taken flood protection measures that \nmostly involve conventional engineering flood protection \ninfrastructure to mitigate the catastrophic consequences \nof floods. At the same time, flood protection infrastructure \nand measures (such as levees, retention basins, channel \nstraightening and removal of vegetation and sediment) are \namong the main causes of hydromorphological alteration \nand ecological impairment of rivers, in particular by \ndisconnecting river channels from the floodplains and \nmodifying riparian zones.\n\nFurther pressure on the river-floodplain system is exerted \nby activities that drain excess water from the soil to increase \nthe area of land suitable for crop production. Land areas \nmay also be drained to serve for forestry or coastal and \nurban development. Drainage for agriculture has led \nto major losses of wetlands throughout Europe and is \nrelated to several hydromorphological pressures such as \nchannelisation of rivers and channel deepening (Vartia et \nal., 2018). In Europe, 35\u00a0%\tof wetland loss between 2000 \nand 2006 was due to conversion to agriculture (EEA, 2012a); \n\nin south-western Sweden alone, almost 70\u00a0%\tof wetlands \nhave been lost as a result of drainage over the last 50 years \n(Franz\u00e9n et al., 2016). In many European countries, mainly \nin northern and central Europe, between 40\u00a0%\tand 100\u00a0%\tof \nfarmland is being drained (based on data from ICID, 2011).\n\nIn the second RBMPs under the WFD, almost 15 000 surface \nwater bodies (about 10\u00a0%\tof total) are affected by physical \nalterations to their channel, bed or riparian area as a result \nof flood protection and/or agriculture in 21 of the WFD \ncountries. In addition, flood protection and/or drainage for \nagriculture are the reasons for designating almost 7 500 \nwater bodies as heavily modified in 26 WFD countries.\n\nImpacts\n\nBoth flood protection infrastructure and drainage affect \nfloodplains and the connectivity of rivers and streams \nto floodplains, as they cause changes in the land area \nsurrounding water bodies (Image 3.2). This can have major \nimplications for the integrity of both riparian and aquatic \necosystems (Amoros and Roux, 1988; Junk et al., 1989; Junk \nand Wantzen, 2004). In a natural system, lateral connectivity \nbetween rivers and their floodplains allows the exchange \nof water, sediments, biota and nutrients. The loss of \nlateral connectivity leads to the loss of key habitats and, \nas a result, to the decline of species and biodiversity, both \non the floodplain itself and in the aquatic environment. \nFurthermore, physical processes related to the natural water \nretention capacity of floodplains and sediment dynamics are \ndisturbed.\n\nArtificial bank protections that provide flood protection \n(embankments, levees or dykes) affect the morphology and \ndynamics of the river channel by restricting the channel \nwidth and the sediment supply from the river banks. Bank \nreinforcement and levee construction can also lead to bed \nincision because of the resulting high-speed flows; in turn, \nbed incision reduces the connectivity between the river and \nits floodplain (lateral connectivity). The reduction of this lateral \nconnectivity damages the functioning of the riparian zone and \nreduces productivity, nutrient exchange and dispersal of biota \nmore widely across the floodplain (Reform, 2015).\n\nAs far as land drainage is concerned, natural channels have \nbeen straightened and deepened for surface drainage ditches \nwith significant effects on channel morphology, instream \nhabitats for aquatic organisms, floodplain and riparian \nconnectivity, sediment dynamics and nutrient cycling (Blann et \nal., 2009) Furthermore, the regular maintenance of drainage \nditches and rivers (through dredging and weed cutting) leads \nto physical disturbances and morphological changes in water \nbodies (Vartia et al., 2018).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n37Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nThe restoration of bank structures, the reconnection of \nfloodplains or backwaters (such as oxbow lakes and side \nchannels) and the restoration of wetlands are key measures \napplied in river basin management planning to restore lateral \nconnectivity between rivers, their riparian area and the wider \nfloodplain (EEA, 2018b). For example, in the international \nRhine\tbasin,\tabout\t125\u00a0km\u00b2\tof\tfloodplains\thad\tbeen\trestored\t\nby\u00a02012,\twith\ta\ttarget\tof\trestoring\tmore\tthan\t150\u00a0km\u00b2\tby\t2020.\t\nIn addition, measures were taken to increase the structural \ndiversity\tof\tapproximately\t100\u00a0km\tof\triver\tbanks\tby\t2012\t\nwith\ta\ttarget\tof\t800\u00a0km\tby\t2020\t(ICPR,\t2015).\tWith\tincreasing\t\nawareness of the importance of floodplains, the number of \nexamples of restoration measures or work aiming to improve \nriver floodplain systems' functioning is rising (EEA, 2019a).\n\nThe improvement of lateral connectivity between rivers and \ntheir floodplains is a key element for the achievement of the \nenvironmental objectives of the WFD. Multi-benefit measures \nthat support the achievement of environmental requirements \nof various environmental policy instruments beyond the WFD, \nsuch as the Floods Directive, Birds and Habitats Directives and \nthe Nitrates Directive, are particularly relevant to the restoration \nof disconnected wetlands and floodplains. For example, buffer \nstrips can be beneficial for reducing pollution (included in the \nNitrates Directive and the good agricultural and environmental \nconditions of CAP cross-compliance), improving riparian \nhabitats, reducing hydromorphological pressures, increasing \nwater retention and mitigating the impacts of floods.\n\nImage 3.2  Embankments for flood protection (left) and agricultural drainage (right)\n\nSources: \u00a9 Peter Kristensen, EEA.\n\nRiver restoration measures aiming to give more room to rivers \nare also important for floodplain restoration as well as for the \nprevention of flood events. A targeted 'Room for the River' \nprogramme was established in the Netherlands, consisting of \nover 30 projects that were completed at the end of 2018. The \nkey to the room for the river approach is to restore the river's \nnatural floodplain in places where it is least harmful to protect \nthose areas that need to be defended from floods (Dutch \nWater Sector, 2019).\n\nIt is difficult to predict exactly how pressures on European \nfloodplains and lateral connectivity of rivers may develop \nin the future. However, climate change is bound to lead to \nincreased precipitation and flood events, in particular in \nnorthern Europe. In turn, this may require further mitigation \nmeasures linked to flood defences as well as increased \ndrainage, leading to increased pressures on floodplains and \nlateral connectivity (EEA, 2021). At the same time, European \ntargets in the new biodiversity strategy need to be met, and \nthe restoration of floodplains and wetlands is a means of \nrestoring\tat\tleast\t25\u00a0000\u00a0km\tof\tfree-flowing\trivers\tby\t2030\t\n(EC,\u00a02020b).\n\nDespite the obvious importance of floodplain restoration, it \nhas not yet been systematically included in river basin or flood \nrisk management plans. To devise more strategic approaches \nto floodplain restoration in the future, it will be important \nto develop a more coherent knowledge base on floodplains \nand a more targeted approach towards financing this type of \nrestoration (EEA, 2019a).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n38 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n3.2.3 Hydropower\n\nOverview\n\nHydropower has a long history in Europe and currently \ngenerates around 10\u00a0%\tof EU net electricity (Eurostat, 2019b) \nand\tmore\tthan\t33\u00a0%\tof\trenewable\telectricity\tin\tthe\tEU\tin\t2015\t\n(Eurelectric and VGB Powertech, 2018). Norway and Switzerland \nare also countries where hydropower is especially important. At \nthe same time, the construction and operation of hydropower \nplants has major impacts on water bodies and adjacent \nwetlands, such as changes in the flow regime and sediment \ntransport, loss of key habitats and river fragmentation.\n\nIn the second RBMPs, 22 WFD countries reported significant \npressures in the form of barriers, hydrological alterations \nand abstractions related to hydropower production, affecting \napproximately\t9\u00a0000\tsurface\twater\tbodies\t(6\u00a0%\tof total water \nbodies). In addition, hydropower is the most common reason \nfor designating water bodies as heavily modified, applicable to \napproximately\t6\u00a0000\twater\tbodies\tin\t25\tWFD\tcountries\t(half\tof\t\nthese water bodies are in Norway).\n\nIn\tEurope,\tcurrently\tmore\tthan\t21\u00a0000\thydropower\tplants\texist\t\n(Figure\t3.3).\tThe\tmajority\t(ca.\t90\u00a0%) are hydropower plants \nwith\tless\tthan\t10\u00a0MW\tinstalled\tcapacity\t(WWF\tet\tal.,\u00a02019).\t\nLarge hydropower plants (capacity of more than 10\u00a0MW) \nrepresent only 10\u00a0%\tof all hydropower facilities, but they \ngenerate\talmost\u00a090\u00a0%\tof the total hydropower energy produced \n(Devoldere et al., 2011). Germany has the largest number of \nhydropower plants (more than 7\u00a0700), while Austria, France, \nItaly and Sweden each have more than 2\u00a0000 hydropower \nplants (Kampa et al., 2011). Furthermore, in Norway and Spain \nthere are more than 1\u00a0000 existing hydropower plants (WWF \net\u00a0al.,\t2019).\n\nThe main types of hydropower plants based on the ability to \nstore water are (1) run-of-river plants, (2) storage plants and \n(3) pumped storage plants (Image 3.3). Run-of-river plants do \nnot have reservoirs and run on the natural discharge of the \nriver. Storage plants require the construction of a dam and a \nreservoir to store water. In many regions of Europe, run-of-river \nplants are the most common type of hydropower plants, but \nstorage and pumped storage plants account for a higher share \nof the installed capacity.\n\nRecorded hydropower plants in Europe\n\n\u2264 1\n1-10\n10-50\n\n50-100\n> 100\n\nInstalled megawatts (MW) Hydropower plant category\n\nRiver network Existing dam\nUnder construction\nPlanned dam\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\n\nOutside coverage\n\n1 357\n\n270 416\n100 139 21 8 10\n\n5 084\n\n2 837\n\n357\n121 108\n\n0\n\n1 000\n\n2 000\n\n3 000\n\n4 000\n\n5 000\n\n6 000\n\n7 000\n\n8 000\n\n9 000\n\n10 000\n\nInstalled megawatts (MW)\n\n\u2264 1 1-10 10-50 50-100 > 100\n\nNumber of hydropower plants\n\n9 873\n9 471\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n-30\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\nAzores Is.\n\nMadeira Is.\n\n-20\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\nCanary Is.\n\n0 500 1 000 1 500 km\n\nFigure 3.3 Recorded hydropower plants in Europe\n\nNote: Distribution of hydropower plants (left) and distribution of hydropower plants by status and size class (right).\n\nSource: WWF et al.

Nonetheless, \nnew hydropower plants are still under development. Several \nhydropower plants in Europe are under construction (278) \nand\tmany\tmore\tare\tplanned\tto\tbe\tconstructed\t(8\u00a0507).\tThe\t\nWestern Balkans and Turkey in particular have ambitious plans \nto significantly increase their exploitation of hydropower (WWF \net al., 2019). Furthermore, in other parts of Europe, there is an \nincreasing number of applications for new hydropower plants, \nespecially\tsmall\tones\tup\tto\t10\u00a0MW.\tFor\texample,\tin\tItaly\tthere\t\nare more than 500 applications to build new hydropower plants \nof\t1\u00a0MW,\tand\tin\tScotland\tthere\thave\tbeen\tmore\u00a0than\u00a0700\t\napplications for new hydropower developments in the \nlast\u00a015\u00a0years\t(Bussettini, 2019; Fyfe, 2019).\n\nImpacts\n\nHydropower generation has impacts on aquatic ecology, natural \nscenery and ecosystems. The possible key ecological impacts of \nhydropower are described below (ICPDR, 2013).\n\nHydropower dams and weirs interrupt the river's \nlongitudinal continuity. Migrating fish species, such as eel \nand salmon, are particularly affected by the fragmentation of \ntheir habitats. In addition, when fish pass through hydropower \nturbines as they move downstream, a high proportion of them \nare injured or killed. The impact of acting as migration barriers \nis common to most types of hydropower plants.\n\nSources: Left: Tangopaso (https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=23481491).

Hydrological processes and sediment \ntransport lose their natural dynamics, leading to altered \nnatural structures and habitats.\n\nHydropower plants change the river flow regime. In rivers \nthat are impounded for hydropower (typical for storage \nhydropower plants), flow velocity is reduced, which can lead \nto fish becoming disoriented. Reduced flow velocity results in \nother negative impacts such as increased deposition of fine \nsediment in the impoundment.\n\nAnother impact from hydropower results from rapidly \nchanging flows called hydropeaking, which is mainly typical \nof large hydropower plants in combination with reservoirs. \nHydropeaking can cause severe morphological and ecological \neffects on a river and particularly on fish populations.\n\nOften at run-of-river hydropower plants a portion of the river \nwater is diverted, e.g. through a canal, to produce energy. \nThis leads to large flow reductions immediately downstream \nof the river diversion and to changes in flow patterns \nfurther\u00a0downstream.\n\nWater storage and river regulation through hydropower \nplants often also alter physico\u2011chemical conditions \ndownstream, with changes in water temperature, \nsupersaturation of oxygen and altered patterns of ice \nformation in winter.\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=23481491\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n40 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nThere is usually not just one hydropower plant or dam in a \nriver system; instead, several can be present on the main river \nas well as on tributaries. The cumulative effects of multiple \nhydropower plants, in combination with barriers that do not \nserve electricity generation, need to be considered (Kampa and \nBerg, 2020). In a chain of impoundments containing several \nhydropower plants, the total effects can endanger whole fish \npopulations in a river basin.\n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nIn several countries, measures are being implemented to \nmitigate the impacts of hydropower plants on water bodies. \nThe main measures are targeting upstream fish migration \n(especially fishways), downstream fish migration (e.g. fish \nguidance systems and bypasses, fish-friendly turbines), habitat \nrestoration, sediment management and the implementation of \necological flows.\n\nMost EU countries have relevant legislation in place to ensure \nminimum ecological flows and upstream continuity via fishways \nat hydropower plants. However, legislative requirements are \nlacking to address other types of hydropower impacts, such \nas on downstream fish migration, sediment transport and \nhydropeaking, because there are still open questions that \nneed to be addressed by research (Kampa et al., 2011). For \ninstance, knowledge is lacking on measures to mitigate impacts \non downstream migration of fish at hydropower turbines, \nespecially in large rivers.\n\nHydropower plants generally operate under a permit/licensing \nscheme, whereby conditions for the operation are set. However, \nmany hydropower plants were licensed before the adoption \nof key EU water policy such as the WFD in 2000 and national \nlaws protecting rivers. In addition, in many countries, licences \nhave unlimited or very long duration (e.g. up to 100 years). \nThe large number of such licences on old hydropower plants, \nwhose operating conditions are difficult to change, remains a \nbig challenge to the implementation of mitigation measures \n(Kampa et al., 2017).\n\nSince 2000, the WFD has been a strong driver for modifying \nthe licensing procedures for new hydropower plants and for \nrevising licences of existing plants in many countries. In case \nof new hydropower plants, licences are issued that include \nrequirements for implementing mitigation measures, to \ncomply with national or regional mitigation requirements for \nhydropower plants.\n\nFurthermore, reconstruction, repowering and subsidies are \nused to introduce ecological demands into the licences. There \nare plans to reconstruct many existing hydropower plants, \nas a lot of facilities across Europe are over 40 years old. \n\nThe\u00a0reconstruction\tand\tmodernisation\tof\told\thydropower\t\nplants can often significantly increase their power output and \noffer an alternative to the construction of new plants, which \nwould affect further stretches of free-flowing rivers.\n\nOverall, as the energy systems of European countries depend \non energy produced via hydropower, there is a need for \nmeasures that mitigate ecological impacts with the least \npossible effect on energy production for existing and new \nhydropower plants.\n\nLarge-scale strategies for more sustainable hydropower are \nbeing developed. Examples include Sweden's new national plan \nfor the revision of hydropower licences in the next 20 years, \nincluding the Hydroelectric Environmental Fund for mitigation \nmeasures based on industry contributions (SWAM, 2019). \nSwitzerland's Water Protection Act set mitigation targets for \nhydropower by 2030, offering financing of mitigation measures \nvia an electricity surcharge (Kampa, et al., 2017). In addition, \nat the transboundary level, guiding principles for sustainable \nhydropower development have been developed for the \ninternational Danube basin (ICPDR, 2013). At the same time, \nthough, there is a worrying trend towards developing many \nnew hydropower plants, especially in the Western Balkans and \nTurkey, and a rising number of applications to develop small \nnew hydropower plants across Europe.\n\n3.2.4 Inland navigation\n\nOverview\n\nNavigation affects most of the major rivers in Europe because \nof the presence of inland waterways on the large European \nrivers and intensive leisure boat activity on the smaller rivers. \nFurthermore, many canals were developed during the early \nperiod of industrialisation and some navigable rivers and canal \nsystems are used only for leisure boats nowadays. To allow \nnatural rivers to be used as modern shipping lanes, numerous \nchanges have been made to rivers and their floodplains. \nInland navigation is typically associated with a range of \nhydromorphological alterations, such as channelisation, \nchannel deepening, channel maintenance, installation of \ngroynes and flow regulation, which adversely affect water \necosystems (ICPDR, 2007; BMU/UBA, 2016). The alterations \nare bigger when smaller rivers are made navigable for ships \nthat are too large for the natural size of the river. In the second \nRBMPs, a relatively small number of river and lake water bodies \n(approximately 700 water bodies across 13 WFD countries) were \nreported as being affected by pressures from inland navigation. \nHowever, navigation issues are of considerable importance in \nsome of the largest river basins in Europe, such as the Danube \nand the Rhine.\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n41Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nNavigation intensity has been increasing in Europe since \nthe\u00a01960s,\tin\tterms\tof\tboth\tthe\tvolume\tof\tgoods\ttransported\t\nand average vessel size (Graf et al., 2016). Nowadays, there \nare more than 37 000 km of European inland waterways, \nspanning 20 Member States and connecting hundreds \nof cities and industrial sites (DG Mobility and Transport, \n2016). The uses of inland waterways include navigation \nfor transporting freight and passengers and for leisure \n(Image 3.4). Most of the commercial goods transport by \ninland ships in Europe concerns five countries: Belgium, \nFrance, Germany, the Netherlands and Romania (EC, \n2018b). More than two thirds of all goods transported on \nEuropean inland waterways are carried on the river Rhine, \nwhich is the backbone of inland navigation in Europe \n(EPRS, 2014). The total volume of goods transported on \nEuropean\tinland\twaterways\tis\tapproximately\u00a0550\tmillion\t\n\ntonnes.\tHowever,\u00a0this\tequates\tto\tonly\taround\t6\u00a0%\t(in 2017) \nof the total volume of all goods transported in the EU \n(Eurostat,\u00a02019c).\n\nIn addition, inland waterways are used for water tourism, \nsports, fishing and angling, and for recreational purposes. \nThe recreational water use of navigable rivers can be of \ngreat economic significance in certain regions, as it supports \nseveral thousand jobs in Europe (PIANC et al., 2004).\n\nThe infrastructure network of inland waterways includes the \nnatural navigable rivers, artificial canals that link navigable \nrivers and inland ports. European inland waterways are part \nof the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which \naims to integrate land, marine and air transport networks \nthroughout Europe.\n\nSources:  \u00a9 Peter Kristensen, EEA.\n\nImage 3.4  Examples of inland navigation vessels for recreational and commercial purposes\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n42 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nImpacts\n\nThe main impacts from inland navigation on aquatic \necosystems are related to hydromorphological pressures, \nsuch as the construction of groynes, the protection of river \nbanks with rip-rap and the deepening and maintenance of the \nchannel (e.g. through dredging). Altering the shape of river \ncourses to improve navigation affects the characteristics of \nriver beds, river banks and the dynamics of sediment transport. \nThe effects can spread upstream and downstream over many \nyears. Permanent changes to water levels and flows affect \nthe whole river valley bottom and the ecology of floodplains. \nNavigation works tend to be designed to stabilise river channels \nin both space and time, which constrains the natural dynamics \nof the river, which are important for creating and renewing key \nhabitats (ECMT, 2006). Thus, navigation requirements result \nin stabilised, ecologically uniform river channels, which lack \nnatural in-stream structures and connectivity with the nearby \nfloodplains (ICPDR, 2007).\n\nShip traffic also causes waves, which can disturb the \nreproduction habitats of fish and benthic invertebrates \nand have an impact on aquatic plants. In addition, the \nengines of ships can cause an unnatural suspension of fine \nsediments, leading to reduced light for plant and algal growth \n(ICPDR,\u00a02007).\tFurthermore,\tnavigable\trivers\tare\tusually\t\naffected by numerous impoundments to achieve a uniform \nwater level, which, at the same time, disrupt river continuity and \nfish migration.\n\nIn addition to hydromorphological impacts, inland navigation \ncan be a potential source of pollution coming from ship waste \n(oily and greasy ship waste, cargo waste, waste water and \nhousehold waste from passenger ships) or bilge water. There \nis also a risk of accidental spills, involving oil or hazardous \nsubstances, resulting from collision of or damage to ships \n(ICPR, 2015; EC, 2018b). For example, on the river Rhine, in 2018 \nand the years before, oil released from shipping was the most \nfrequently reported pollutant in sudden pollution incidents \n(ICPR, 2015).\n\nFinally, to maintain navigable water levels in artificial canals that \nconnect different river systems, water is often moved between \nrivers, not only altering hydrology but also spreading invasive \nalien species. Furthermore, shipping is an important dispersal \nvector for invasive species between river systems, either by \ntransport on the vessels or by release of bilge water.\n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nIn some countries and regions in the EU, such as the international \nriver basins of the Rhine and Danube, actions have been taken or \nare ongoing to reconcile inland waterway development with river \n\nrestoration objectives. Key measures to mitigate the impacts of \ninland navigation on rivers and lakes include the reconstruction \nof groynes, the removal of hard bank reinforcements and their \nreplacement with soft engineering solutions, the reconnection of \nside arms, floodplains and oxbow lakes to restore river habitats, \nas well as the use of more ecologically oriented dredging for the \nmaintenance of waterways.\n\nThe environmental objectives of the WFD are a major driver \nfor the development of such measures within the RBMPs. In \naddition, to support the objective of more sustainable inland \nwaterway transport, several European guidelines have been \ndeveloped to demonstrate good practices for waterway \ndevelopment that are compatible with environmental \nprotection requirements (e.g. PIANC Guidelines for sustainable \ninland waterways and navigation (PIANC, 2003) and Platina \nManual on good practices in sustainable waterway planning \n(Platina, 2010)).\n\nFurthermore, the issue of pollution from inland navigation \nneeds to be addressed with appropriate measures. For \ninstance, to deal with pollution and emissions from navigation \non the Rhine, a convention on the collection, deposit and \nreception of waste produced during navigation on the river \nwaterways was adopted in 2009 (ICPR, 2015). Deliberate or \naccidental losses of pollutants from inland navigation are being \nrecorded in the international warning and alarm plan for the \nRhine (ICPR, 2019).\n\nLarge-scale strategies for more sustainable inland navigation \nat national or regional levels are being developed. An example \nis the 'Blue Ribbon' programme in Germany, which is aimed \nat creating a system of ecologically reshaped waterways \nby funding the renaturation of federal waterways and their \nfloodplains. The programme focuses on the sections that are no \nlonger needed for cargo shipping (minor waterways) but it also \nimplements 'ecological stepping stones' in the major waterways \n(BMU/UBA, 2016). At the transboundary level of the Danube \nbasin, a joint statement on inland navigation and environmental \nsustainability in the Danube provided principles and criteria for \nenvironmentally sustainable inland navigation, including the \nmaintenance of existing waterways and the development of \nfuture waterway infrastructure (ICPDR, 2019).\n\nAt the same time, however, there may be an increase in \ninland waterway transport, in view of EU targets to shift part \nof long-distance road freight to rail and waterborne transport \n(see Commission White Paper on the roadmap to a single \nEuropean transport area (EC, 2011b)). However, plans for inland \nnavigation in Europe need to take account of the changing \nclimatic conditions. Severe droughts in 2018 led to low river \nflows, which made parts of major European waterways, such as \nthe Rhine and the Danube, unnavigable for larger cargo barges.\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n43Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n3.3 Abstractions and water scarcity\n\nOverview\n\nClimate change, population growth, urbanisation and \nintensifying economic activities make water scarcity a critical \nconcern in Europe. Water scarcity occurs when the demand for \nwater for human needs frequently (though not necessarily year \nround) exceeds the capacity of the natural system to supply it; it \nis the consequence of anthropogenic impacts on the availability \nof water resources (EEA, forthcoming). In some areas of Europe, \nwater abstractions are characterised by seasonality, adding \nto the existing water scarcity drivers of weather phenomena, \ntemperatures and geographical location (EEA, forthcoming).\n\nIn the second RBMPs of WFD countries, around 8 000 surface \nwater\tbodies\t(about\t6\u00a0%\tof\ttotal)\twere\taffected\tby\tsignificant\t\npressures from abstraction, with the highest shares in Hungary, \nSpain, Cyprus and Bulgaria. For around half of these surface \nwater bodies, significant pressures from abstractions are linked \nto agriculture, while abstractions for public water supply and \nindustry are also major pressures.\n\nOver recent decades, groundwater aquifers have also \nbeen affected by overexploitation in many parts of Europe \n(EEA,\u00a02019g). In the second RBMPs, water abstraction was a \nsignificant\tpressure\tfor\t17\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tgroundwater\tarea\tin\tEurope,\t\nwith the highest shares in Hungary, Malta and Cyprus. The \nreported groundwater water abstractions are mainly for public \nwater supply, followed by agriculture and industry.\n\nIn 2017, water use in Europe by different economic sectors \nwas made up as follows: agriculture (58 %);\tcooling\twater\tfor\t\nenergy production (18 %);\tmining,\tquarrying,\tconstruction\t\nand manufacturing industries (11 %);\thouseholds\t(10 %)\tand\t\nservice\tindustries\t(3\t%)\t(EEA, 2019c). Water use refers to the \nnet water abstracted, which is estimated as the difference \nbetween the volume of water abstracted and the volume \nof water returned to the environment before or after use. \nThe average return ratio of water used for cooling lies \nat\taround\u00a080 %,\twhile\tonly\tabout\t30\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\twater\t\nabstracted for agricultural purposes in Europe returns to the \nenvironment (EEA, forthcoming). The low water returns to the \nenvironment combined with high water consumption makes \nagriculture one of the sectors that puts significant pressure \non renewable water resources (EEA, forthcoming), especially \nin southern European countries, which record up to 80\u00a0%\tof \nwater\tuse\tfor\u00a0agriculture.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2017, water abstraction in the EU-27 and the \nUK\tdecreased\tby\t17\u00a0%, while the gross added value generated \nfrom all economic sectors increased by 59\u00a0%\tin the same \nperiod. Despite this positive trend, water scarcity and drought \nevents continue to cause significant risks in southern Europe, as \nwell as in specific areas of other European regions (EEA, 2019c). \nThe frequency of either droughts or water scarcity and areas \naffected are increasing and continuously expanding towards \ncentral and western Europe (EEA, forthcoming). According \nto recent projections, further intensification and a longer \nduration of water scarcity is expected under global warming in \nthe EU, specifically in the Mediterranean countries (Bisselink \net\tal.,\u00a02020) (see Map 3.2). By 2030, half of the EU's river \nbasins are expected to experience water scarcity and stress \n(Tr\u00e9molet\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\t2019).\n\nImpacts of abstractions and water scarcity\n\nWater scarcity and drought events are an increasing problem in \nmany areas of Europe, both permanently and seasonally. The \nenvironment needs water to sustain aquatic ecosystems and \necosystem services. Low water availability affects surface water \nand groundwater, altering the hydrological regime, degrading \necosystems and leading to severe ecological impacts that \naffect not only biodiversity and habitats but also the quality of \nwater and soil (e.g. affecting water temperature, reducing the \ndilution capacity of pollutants and causing saline intrusions \n(EEA,\u00a02019b)).\n\nIn particular, (over) abstraction of surface water bodies can \ncause the drying out of water courses and wetland areas in \nEurope and the lowering of river water levels (EEA, 2018c). \nThis is a common problem in areas with low rainfall and high \npopulation density and in areas with intensive agricultural or \nindustrial activity (EEA, 2018c). The drying out or low flow of \nriver courses can have adverse ecological effects, such as a \ndecline in species richness and vegetation encroachment. For \nexample, water abstraction converted naturally perennially \nflowing rivers to intermittently flowing rivers in Spain, leading to \na decline of 35\u00a0%\tin fish species richness (Benejam et al., 2010).\n\nIn addition, the (over) abstraction of groundwater bodies \ncan cause the lowering of groundwater levels (EEA, 2018c), \nwith further impacts on groundwater-dependent aquatic \necosystems. In coastal areas, saltwater can intrude into the \ngroundwater aquifers from which freshwater is abstracted, \nleading to salinisation and rendering the aquifers unusable as \na\u00a0drinking\twater\tsupply\t(EEA,\t2018b).\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n44 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nWater scarcity is a complex phenomenon that entails multiple \nand often interconnected causes. Thus, an integrated water \nmanagement approach, including coherent and consistent \npolicy instruments, education, economic tools, structural \ninterventions, where needed, and recourse to new technologies, \nappears most suited to attain European goals and the \nSustainable Development Goals for water. Several measures \nare used to address the adverse impacts of water abstractions \nand water scarcity on the environment, and these can be \nroughly divided into demand-side and supply-side measures.\n\nIn the past, European water management largely focused \non increasing supply by, for example, drilling new wells and \nconstructing reservoirs (EEA, 2018b). However, as Europe \ncannot endlessly increase its water supply, various policies \nand measures put an emphasis on managing water demand \nand making the transition from crisis management to risk \nmanagement (EEA, forthcoming). Measures to reduce \ndemand can include the use of economic instruments, \nincluding water pricing, water loss controls (e.g. detection \nand repair of leaks), increased efficiency of domestic, \n\n0 500 1 000 1 500 km\n\nRelative change in 10-year river water deficit between present (1981-2010) and the end of the century (2071-2100) under RCP4.5 (left)\nand RCP8.5 (right) scenarios\n\nPercentage of change in 10-year river water deficit\n\n-75 to\n -5\n\n0\n> 75\n\nOutside coverage\n\n\u2264 -7\n5\n\n-50 to\n -2\n\n5\n\n-25 to\n 0\n\n0 to\n 25\n\n25 to\n 50\n\n50 to\n 75\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\nRCP8.5RCP4.5\n\nMap 3.2 Projected change in 10-year river water deficit between the present (1981-2010) and the end of the \n21st century (2071\u20112100) in Europe, under two emissions scenarios\n\nNotes: These\tmaps\tshow\tthe\trelative\tchange\tin\t10-year\triver\twater\tdeficit\tunder\tthe\t95th\tpercentile\tfor\ttwo\tgreenhouse\tgas\temissions\t\nscenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).\n\nSource: Bisselink et al.

In addition, monitoring, \nmetering, authorising water abstractions and defining \nenvironmental flows have progressed, but their enforcement \nstill needs to improve further (EEA, forthcoming). In some \ncountries, especially in southern Europe, efforts to address \noverabstraction and illegal abstractions via permits and to \nsecure long-term sustainability remain inadequate (Tr\u00e9molet \net\u00a0al.,\t2019;\tRoss,\t2016).\n\nAt the same time, the increasing demand for water for \nsocio-economic activities under a changing climate forces \nMember States to explore additional measures to secure \ntheir water supply. Innovative measures to supply water using \nunconventional resources (e.g. desalination, water reuse \nand rainwater harvesting) are already implemented in many \nMember States (EEA, forthcoming). Other, more traditional, \nwater supply measures, such as new reservoirs for water \nstorage or interbasin water transfers, may be considered when \nother demand options have been exhausted (EEA, 2018b). \nOverall, further evidence-based exchange is needed among \n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n45Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nexperts and countries on the kind of water supply-side options \nthat are more sustainable and need further promotion.\n\nRelying on only one type of measure may not be enough to \nachieve environmental objectives. Instead, a combination of \nmeasures, which may include measures to reduce demand \nand to supply water, is desirable to tackle the impacts of water \nabstractions and water scarcity from a consistent and long-term \nperspective. Techniques may range from water pricing \nincentives to the reduction of network leakages rates (Tr\u00e9molet \net al., 2019).\n\nStrategic planning instruments have also been in use in \nEuropean countries, such as drought management plans in \nSpain. These enable the planning, monitoring and mitigating \nof water scarcity situations and enhance decision-making \nduring periods of drought (EC, 2007; Stein et al., 2016; Stein and \nLandgrebe, 2019).\n\nFinally, land management and land use planning are essential \nfor water management in water-scarce areas and can be used \nto foster measures for natural water retention such as wetland \nrestoration (EEA, 2018b). Natural water retention measures \nand aquifer recharge are promising options for tackling water \nscarcity and water stress, but to be effective they must be \nimplemented at a sufficient scale and thus require further \nassessment (EEA, forthcoming).\n\n3.4 Aquaculture\n\nOverview of aquaculture\n\nAquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms (e.g. fish, \nmolluscs) under controlled conditions; it is an alternative to \ncatching wild fish and takes place in both inland and marine \nareas. Marine aquaculture production has been increasing \nin Europe since the early 1990s, mostly as a result of the \ngrowing salmon production in Norway (EEA, 2018b). Over the \nsame period, inland aquaculture has been relatively stable \n(EEA, 2018b). In 2017, the production of finfish (particularly \nsalmon, trout, seabass, carp and tuna) and molluscs (mussels, \noysters and clams) together accounted for almost the \nentire aquaculture production of almost 1.5 million tonnes \nin\tthe\tEU\tand\thad\ta\tvalue\tof\tapproximately\tEUR\u00a05\tbillion\t\n(Eurostat,\u00a02019a).\tFreshwater\taquaculture\tcontributes\tto\t20%\tof\t\ntotal EU aquaculture production in terms of volume in the last \nten years (EUMOFA, 2021).\n\nAquaculture production, both inland and marine, can put \nsignificant pressures on European waters when it comes to \npoint and diffuse source pollution, changes in flow, dredging \nand the introduction of alien species. In the second RBMPs, \naround\t1\u00a0400\tsurface\twater\tbodies\t(mainly\trivers)\twere\t\nreported to have significant pressures from aquaculture in 20 \nEuropean countries, with the highest shares in Finland, Bulgaria, \nHungary and Czechia. Water abstraction for fish farms were \n\nthe most frequently reported aquaculture pressures, followed \nby point source pollution, hydrological alterations and diffuse \nsource pollution.\n\nThree major types of freshwater aquaculture in European \nwaters can be distinguished (EUMOFA, 2021):\n\n1. Extensive pond farming. This consists of maintaining ponds \n(natural or artificial) with low fish density and natural fish \nfeed. Production in extensive farms is generally low (less \nthan 1 t/ha per year). It is practised across Europe and is \nparticularly common in central and eastern Europe.\n\n2. Semi-intensive freshwater aquaculture. The production of the \npond is increased by adding supplementary feed, allowing \nhigher stocking densities and production per hectare.\n\n3. Intensive freshwater aquaculture in tanks. Fish are bred until \nthey reach a marketable size. There are two techniques: \neither river water enters the tanks upstream and leaves \ndownstream or the water remains in a closed circuit and is \nrecycled and 'recirculated' in the tanks.\n\nIn addition, three major types of marine aquaculture exist:\n\n1. Extensive brackish water aquaculture in artificial lagoons. \nThe semi-extensive nature is characterised by introducing \nhatchery fry and providing additional feed.\n\n2. Intensive sea farming. Sea cages hold fish captive in a large \npocket-shaped net anchored to the bottom and maintained \non the surface by a rectangular or circular floating \nframework.\n\n3. Intensive aquaculture in tanks. Artificial shore-based tanks \ncan be used to breed marine fish. Recirculating the \nwater creates a closed and controlled environment that \nis necessary for optimal production in hatcheries and \nnurseries for marine species.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe pressures and impacts of aquaculture depend on farm \nlocation, type of cultured organism, methods used, intensity \nand the sensitivity or vulnerability of the environment to \npossible pressures (Jeffrey et al., 2014). Potential impacts of \naquaculture on aquatic ecosystems are shown in Figure 3.4 and \nare discussed as follows.\n\nAquaculture releases oxygen\u2011consuming substances and \nnutrients (as excretory products and uneaten fish food) as \nwell as chemical contaminants (e.g. disinfectants, veterinary \nmedicinal products, trace metals) into water. The released \npollutants can cause deoxygenation of the water, causing \nadverse impacts on the benthic fauna and contributing to local \nalgal blooms and eutrophication. Anti-corrosion materials \n(e.g. copper, zinc-plated steel) and antifouling paint used in \n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n46 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\naquaculture systems can leak into the sea from fish cages and \nropes, with toxic effects on ecosystems.\n\nCultured organisms that escape from aquaculture \nproduction sites can interbreed and compete with wild stocks \nand can also introduce pathogens. Sea lice infestations, for \nexample, can threaten wild fish populations by reducing the \nsurvival and reproduction rates of wild salmonids. A number \nof studies links the presence of fish farms to outbreaks of lice \nin the environment, particularly in the case of salmon (Science \nfor Environment Policy, 2015).\n\nFishponds are also often associated with barriers and \nhydrological alterations, which can adversely affect the \nupstream and downstream migration of fish and other \norganisms. The presence of barriers may reduce flow velocity \nand thus support eutrophication effects. Barriers may also \ndisrupt the natural transport of sediment, affecting the stability \nof river beds and related ecosystems downstream.\n\nWater intakes for aquaculture production are associated \nwith water abstraction, which can contribute to decreasing \ngroundwater levels and to low flow in rivers.\n\nNorway, being the biggest aquaculture producer in Europe, \nannually produces a report on the risks related to aquaculture \nproduction covering different environmental impacts, \nincluding nutrient pollution, chemical contamination, \nsea lice infestations and escapes of cultured salmon \n(Grefsrud\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02021).\n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nA broad range of management and technical measures exist \nto tackle the adverse impacts of aquaculture on European \nwaters, in particular limits on production, improving the \n\nsiting of aquaculture operations and developing codes \nof best management practices. At national and regional \nlevels, an important regulatory instrument is to set limits \non production (EC, 2016b). For example, in 2019, Denmark \ndecided to stop creating new aquaculture facilities and \nthe expanding of existing ones. This is because coastal \nareas and inland waters are overloaded with nitrogen, and \nmitigation measures have not been enough to tackle the \nissue. In Denmark, there is also government finance to \nsupport the removal of weirs on rivers built for use in fish \nfarming facilities (Salmon Business, 2019; Tyrrell, 2019).\n\nImproving the siting of aquaculture operations can be \nillustrated by the Norwegian Aquaculture Act, which requires \nan environmental impact assessment for new aquaculture \nsites. The Act calls for fish farms to be located in areas with \ngood biological recipient conditions, high bearing capacity \nand generally good self-cleaning properties (FAO, 2017).\n\nTechnical methods, management systems and practices \nshould be incorporated into more formal 'codes of practice' \nadopted voluntarily across the whole aquaculture industry. \nCodes of best management practices should promote the \nfollowing (Phillips et al., 2001):\n\n1. reduced use of fertilisers, antibiotics and chemicals, \ntheir replacement with non-harmful or less harmful \nsubstances, or the introduction of new physical \nbiofouling management techniques to reduce the \nimpact of nutrients and chemical discharges (Science for \nEnvironment\tPolicy,\u00a02015);\n\n2. implementation of zonal or area management plans, \nas part of river basin management plans, to reduce the \noverall disease and parasite burden on sites (Science for \nEnvironment Policy, 2015);\n\nFigure 3.4 Aquaculture pressures and potential environmental impacts\n\nRelease of \noxygen-consuming \n\nsubstances and nutrients\n\nUse of chemical \ncontaminants Water abstraction Escape of cultured \n\norganism\n\nPresence of barriers \nand hydrological \n\nalteration\n\n\u2013 Biodiversity loss\n\u2013 Changes in aquatic community\n\n\u2013 Deoxygenation\n\u2013 Eutrophication\n\n\u2013 Toxic e\ufffdects\n\u2013 Pathogen infections\n\n\u2013 Disruption of longitudinal continuity\n\u2013 Changes in hydrology\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n47Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n3. transport of fish as fertilised eggs (not as living animals) \nto reduce the spread of diseases from introduced \naquaculture species (Peeler et al., 2011)\n\n4. sterilisation of farmed species to control the impact of \nescapees and alien species (Science for Environment \nPolicy, 2015);\n\n5. treatment of waste water from closed systems (tanks, \nponds), i.e. with techniques comparable to urban and \nanimal farming waste treatment.\n\nFurthermore, setting up best available techniques, similar to \nthose drafted for other sectors under the Industrial Emissions \nDirective (IED), would be a potentially effective way of \naddressing the environmental impacts from the aquaculture \nsector.\n\nWithin the EU, production from aquaculture is not expected \nto grow significantly in the future, despite the higher level \nof subsidies put in place (Guillen et al., 2019). Nevertheless, \nthe present and future adverse impacts of aquaculture on \nEuropean waters need to be addressed. Aquaculture is \nrecognised as a source of significant pressure on waters, and \nthe programmes of measures to implement the WFD and \nMarine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) need to contain \nexplicit actions to reduce pressures from aquaculture where \nrelevant. Further integration of measures at the farm site \nlevel with regulatory measures at the river basin, national \nand EU levels is required to reduce the adverse effects of \naquaculture production on European waters.\n\n3.5 Invasive alien species\n\nOverview\n\nAlien species are plants and animals that have been \ndeliberately or accidentally introduced outside their natural \nrange. Having found good living conditions, such species \nmay spread quickly and thus become 'invasive'. Once \nestablished, they are difficult or impossible to control.\n\nIn the aquatic environment, alien species are non-native \nplants or animals that compete with, and could even \neradicate, natural aquatic species. Invasive alien species \n(IASs) are thus a significant pressure on the good \necological status of surface waters, aquatic habitats and \nspecies in general. In the second RBMPs, 15 European \ncountries reported IASs as a significant pressure for \napproximately\u00a02\u00a0700\twater\tbodies\t(2\u00a0%\tof total), with the \nhighest shares being reported in Spain, the Netherlands, \nNorway\tand\u00a0Slovakia.\n\nIt is estimated that there are about 750 freshwater species \nthat are established as alien or suspected to be alien in \nEuropean inland waters (Nunes et al., 2015). Species such \nas the Chinese mitten crab or the zebra mussel are a major \nthreat to Europe's aquatic biodiversity. The number of IASs \nin European freshwaters has been rising, having increased \nsevenfold over the last 100 years (European Network on \nInvasive Alien Species, EASIN (Cid and Cardoso, 2013). \nAccording to recent data from EASIN, the highest numbers \nof freshwater alien species have been registered in river \nbasin districts in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, \nSweden\tand\tIreland\u00a0(13).\n\nAlien species are mainly introduced to freshwaters via \naquaculture following releases and via escapes of aquarium \nspecies. Furthermore, introductions through inland canals or \nshipping (e.g. with ballast water) and fisheries or angling are also \nquite widespread but make up a lower share of alien species \nintroductions (Nunes et al., 2015). Climate change is obviously \nan additional reason, for example if the temperature increases, \nthe currently natural thermal barriers that normally limit the \nestablishment of IASs will become more suitable for them. This \nwill potentially lead to a geographical redistribution of species \nand create invasive alien aquatic communities (IUCN, 2017). \n\nIn\tEuropean\tseas,\tmore\tthan\t1\u00a0360\tmarine\talien\tspecies\thave\t\nbeen\tobserved,\tof\twhich\talmost\t1\u00a0100\thave\tbeen\tintroduced\t\nsince 1950. These consist primarily of crustaceans and \nmolluscs, followed by plants, microorganisms and fish. The \nrate of introductions in the marine environment is continually \nincreasing, with almost 300 new species reported since the \nyear\u00a02000\t(EEA, 2012b).\n\nImpacts\n\nIASs threaten native wildlife, alter communities, affect food \nwebs and introduce new constraints to the recovery of native \nbiodiversity. Some also cause economic damage.\n\nExamples of invasive plants are curly waterweed (Lagarosiphon \nmajor), floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) and \nlarge-flowered waterweed (Egeria densa). Such plants may cover \nlarge areas of water and wetlands, making the survival of natural \nvegetation and ecosystems impossible. Invasive plants have \ndisrupted navigation and damaged waterworks by blocking pipes \nand pumps. For example, the total annual control costs to control \ndamage caused by floating pennywort in the Netherlands are \naround\tEUR\u00a01\tmillion\t(BirdLife International, 2021b) . This also \nincludes damage to pumping intakes for cooling water for nuclear \npower plants, resulting in safety problems (Sarat et al., 2015).\n\nSome invasive aquatic invertebrates have had major effects \non the ecosystems that they invade, e.g. the red swamp \n\n(13) European Commission Joint Research Centre, European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) (https://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu).\n\nhttps://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\f\nSelected key European water management challenges\n\n48 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\ncrayfish and the distribution of the crayfish plague. The \nplague is estimated to have an economic cost in Europe \nof\tover\tEUR\u00a053\tmillion/year\t(EC, 2019e). The zebra mussel \n(Dreissena polymorpha) forms dense encrustations, which \ncause serious damage to infrastructure, clogging up the water \nintake of industrial and drinking water plants. The killer shrimp \n(Dicerogammarus villosus) can feed on a variety of freshwater \ninvertebrates, including other native shrimp species, fish eggs \nand young fish, and it can significantly alter ecosystems (BirdLife \nInternational, 2021b). Alien species may also act as carriers of \nfungal organisms or spread diseases (Strayer, 2010).\n\nInvasive freshwater fish, for example introduced by stocking, \nhave disrupted the food web by predating the native smaller \nfish and their food and simplified the original communities \n(BirdLife International, 2021a). Escapes from aquaculture \n(e.g. salmon) have changed the genetic behaviour of natural \npopulations.\n\nMeasures and management challenges\n\nAccording to the IAS Regulation (1143/2014/EU), all Member \nStates should implement strategic plans and measures to \ncombat the adverse effects of IASs. These should include \nprevention, early detection and rapid eradication measures as \nwell as management measures.\n\nPrevention measures are pathway oriented and are aimed \nat preventing the intentional or unintentional introduction \nof IASs. One example is ballast water management (under \nthe Ballast Water Management Convention), under which the \nballast water of ships has to be treated, filtered or exchanged \nin the open sea before entering freshwater ecosystems to \navoid the introduction of IASs, for example the Chinese mitten \ncrab. To avoid further spread of invasive plants between \nunconnected water bodies by, for example, water sport \nequipment (such as boats and trailers), public awareness \nraising, also for angling, hunting or zoos, is carried out. Other \nmeasures are reducing nutrients for plant reduction or \nphysical barriers.\n\nThe basis for early detection and rapid eradication \nmeasures are surveillance and monitoring to detect the \npresence of IASs by, for example, establishing an early \n\ndetection network, citizen science initiatives, eDNA \nmonitoring and remote sensing techniques to detect \ninvasive floating plants. Cutting, mowing or hand weeding \nof submerged plants, and trapping, hunting and fishing \nfor fish and crustaceans are also measures used to \neradicate\u00a0IASs.\n\nManagement measures are aimed at minimising the \nharm that IASs cause. Examples are the commercial use \nof the Chinese mitten crab for consumption, biological \ncontrol (manipulation) of the food web of an ecosystem \nand the use of herbicides to control massive invasive plant \ngrowth.\n\nIn addition to the IAS Regulation, other policies tackle \naquatic alien species as well. Under the WFD, alien \nspecies have been identified and monitored as a \npressure in European water bodies. However, only a \nsmall number of measures to reduce the pressure of \nalien species were implemented within the second \nRBMPs (EC, 2019a). Other relevant policies include the \nMSFD, which sets specific objectives for managing alien \n(non-indigenous) species in European seas to achieve \ngood environmental status, and the regulation concerning \nthe use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture \n(Council\u00a0Regulation\u00a07087/2007/EU).\n\nCurrently, there is no direct cross-linkage between \nmanagement strategies under the IAS Regulation, the \nWFD or the MSFD. However, there is immense potential \nfor the more efficient protection of naturally occurring \naquatic communities, as measures to protect aquatic \nspecies under the IAS Regulation are also suitable for \nfulfilling the goals of the WFD and the MSFD. Nearly all \nMember States have national strategies for preventing \nand mitigating the impact of IASs, and these should \nbe more closely coordinated with the programmes \nof measures under the WFD RBMPs and the MSFD. \nConsidering the significant increase in alien species \nin freshwaters and the marine environment in recent \ndecades, there is a risk that the number of alien species \ncontinues to rise, which would have a considerable \nimpact on biodiversity if harmonisation and efficient \nmanagement strategies are not implemented.\n\f\n49Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n4\nCross-cutting issues \n\nfor key European water \nmanagement\u00a0challenges\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nChapter 3 presents selected key water management challenges \nthat put European water bodies most at risk of not achieving \nthe environmental objectives of the Water Framework Directive \n(WFD). The drivers and pressures of these challenges are \ndescribed and their key impacts on water ecosystems outlined. \nFurthermore, summaries of key measures available to tackle \nthe issues and of management challenges of EU-wide relevance \nare presented. \n\nA broad range of technical and management measures are \nalready available; details of specific measures required will be \nprovided in the third WFD planning cycle. The third river basin \nmanagement plans (RBMPs) are expected to include measures \nand actions whose implementation is continued from previous \nplanning cycles as well as new measures.\n\nBy 2015, when the second RBMPs were published, only some \nmeasures of the first programmes of measures had been \ncompleted in the river basin districts. The lack of finance and \nthe unexpected long planning times were identified as the \nmain obstacles to the implementation, along with missing \nmechanisms for implementing measures (e.g. national \nregulations not yet adopted) and governance issues (EC, 2019a).\n\nIn 2021, the European Commission will provide an overview \nof progress on implementing the measures of the second \nprogramme of measures. The Fitness Check of the WFD and \nthe Floods Directive (EC, 2019c) has already indicated that the \nmain reasons that the WFD's objectives have not been fully \nreached yet are insufficient funding, slow implementation and \ninsufficient integration of environmental objectives in sectoral \npolicies, including gaps in EU water legislation. Similarly, the \nevaluation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive \n(UWWTD) concluded that it is overall fit for purpose, although \nthere is scope to enhance its positive effects and to step up the \nimplementation in a number of Member States. However, the \nUWWTD does not deal adequately with emerging pollutants \nsuch as pharmaceuticals and microplastics (EC, 2019b).\n\nIt is thus expected that the measures required to tackle the \nkey European water management challenges presented in this \nreport can be mobilised through better implementation of the \nexisting legislative framework on water (basic measures under \nthe WFD) and the introduction of supplementary measures that \nfurther reduce key pressures.\n\nAt the same time, the summaries of measures and \nmanagement responses to several key water management \nchallenges indicate that the following are cross-cutting issues of \nEU-wide relevance in implementing measures:\n\n\u2022 There is a need for better harmonisation of the objectives \nand management responses of different directives and \nstrategies, which set the EU policy context for taking actions \nand measures.\n\n\u2022 There is a need to coordinate sectoral developments with \nriver basin management planning under the WFD.\n\n\u2022 The funding of measures is also an issue.\n\nThese cross-cutting issues are discussed in this chapter, with \nemphasis on:\n\n\u2022 their role in improving and accelerating the implementation \nof measures to achieve the WFD's objectives; \n\n\u2022 the identification of actions and coordination requirements \nat the EU-wide level.\n\nIn short, in this chapter, it is argued that the implementation \nof measures to tackle key European water management \nchallenges can be further enhanced and accelerated via better \ncoordination of EU strategies and environmental policies, \nespecially in terms of their management responses to reduce \npressures in the water environment. Furthermore, water \npolicy objectives need to be better integrated into other EU \npolicy areas and strategies that deal with the sustainable \ngrowth of different sectors, such as the agriculture, energy \n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n50 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nand transport sectors. In addition, the funding of measures \ncan be optimised, for example by mainstreaming water \nissues in sectoral funding ('water-mainstreaming') and by \nmobilising funding beyond EU and other public funds. Finally, \nthe potentially crucial role of measures that deliver multiple \nbenefits across different policy objectives is discussed.\n\nThe cross-cutting issues discussed in this chapter are outlined \nin Figure 4.1.\n\n4.2 Coherence of EU policy targets and \nmanagement responses\n\nThe degradation of freshwater ecosystems, water \nabstraction and scarcity, and nutrient and chemical pollution \nare key European water management challenges that \naffect a large share of European water bodies, as described \nin Chapter 3. To address these management challenges, \ntargets and goals are set in European strategies as part \nof the European Green Deal and other major EU policies \npreviously adopted. The set EU targets and goals are linked \nto several management responses and measures, which \nare required by a broad set of EU environmental directives. \nThese linkages are illustrated in Figure 4.2.\n\nTo meet EU targets and goals on water resources and \naquatic ecosystems, greater coherence is needed over \nthe specific objectives and management responses of \nthe relevant EU directives and policies. To implement the \nEuropean Green Deal, better harmonisation and more \neffective coordination is needed between management \nresponses, planning and implementation of measures, \nin particular nature conservation plans, programmes of \nmeasures under the WFD and the Floods Directive, and \nother management plans and strategies with implications \nfor pressures on water.\n\nFor better harmonisation, we should make better use of \nmulti-benefit measures, such as nature-based solutions, \naddressing the goals of different policies (see Section 4.5). \nThe planning of multi-benefit measures also considers \ndifferent water uses and socio-economic issues. Those \nissues are also addressed by an ecosystem-based \nmanagement approach, which is a tool for focusing \non the full array of the ecosystem, such as provision \nof high-quality drinking water, reduction of flood risks \nor recreation, rather than on reaching environmental \nobjectives of specific directives (Grizzetti et al., 2016; \nHornung et al., 2019). This would be best practice for water \nmanagement under the specific directives.\n\nFigure 4.1 Cross\u2011cutting issues for key European water management challenges\n\nNote: EAFRD, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.\n\nFUNDING\nOF MEASURES\n\nEU ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES \nAND EU STRATEGIES\n\nWFD, Floods Dir, Habitats Dir, \nBiodiversity Strategy, Nitrates Dir, \nFarm to Fork, UWWTD, Industrial \n\nEmissions Dir, Zero Pollution \nAction Plan...\n\nEU SECTORAL STRATEGIES\nSustainable agriculture, \n\nRenewable Energy, Sustainable \nmining, Sustainable transport, \n\nSustainable aquaculture...\n\nManagement responses \nto reduce pressures\nManagement plans, \n\nProgrammes of measures, \nConservation action plans...\n\nCoordination of \nmanagement responses\n\nMulti-benefit measures \nPrioritisation approaches \n\nCatchment-based \nmanagement\n\nInclude explicit            \naims and control \n\nmechanisms to limit \nimpacts on water \n\nenvironment\n\nEU key water management \nchallenges (Pressures, \n\nDrivers)\n\nPromotion of sustainable \ngrowth of sectors\n\nCoordination\nof objectives\n\nWater tariffs\n\nTaxes\n\nEU funds\n\nNational funding \nprogrammes\n\nWatermainstreaming\nof sectoral \nfunding, e.g.\nEAFRD EU\nrecovery\npackage\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n51Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nFigure 4.2 Overview of key European water management challenges, EU goals and targets, and management \nresponses addressing the challenges\n\nNotes: BD, Birds Directive; BWD, Bathing Water Directive; DWD, Drinking Water Directive; FD, Floods Directive; HD, Habitats Directive; IAS, \ninvasive alien species; IED, Industrial Emissions Directive; ND, Nitrates Directive; SUPD, Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive; REACH, \nRegulation on registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals.\n\nConservation Plans under HD and BD\n\nNational strategies to prevent spread of IAS\n\nNational Eel management Plans\n\nProgramme of Measures under FD\n\nNational action plans under ND\n\nProgramme of Measures under WFD\n\nIntegrated measures under BWD\n\nMitigation measures under UWWTD\n\nIntegrated measures under DWD\n\nNational action plans under SUPD\n\nSource-based measures under REACH, IED\n\nManagement responses addressing\nthe targets and goals\n\nTargets and goalsWater management\nchallenges\n\n\u2013 25 000 km free-\ufffdowing river\n\u2013 Achieve good ecological status\n\u2013 Increase amount of protected area\n\u2013 Restoration of degraded ecosystems\n\n\u2013 Reduce water abstraction\n\u2013 Increase ecological \ufffdow\n\u2013 Increase resilience of water resources\n\n\u2013 Reduce nutrient losses by 50 %\n\u2013 Reduce the use of fertiliser by 20 %\n\u2013 Increase amount of organic farming by 25 %\n\u2013 Achieve good ecological status\n\u2013 Increase bathing water quality\n\n\u2013 Reduce use and risk of pesticides by 50 %\n\u2013 Achieve good chemical status\n\u2013 Zero pollution ambition\n\nRestore freshwater \necosystems\n\nReduce nutrient \npollution\n\nReduce chemical \npollution\n\nReduce water \nabstraction and \nscarcity\n\nCatchment-based approaches, which encourage the \nintegration of all water and land uses on a catchment scale, \nare also in line with the goals of European strategies. Good \nexamples on a river basin scale are the international river \ncommissions (e.g. the International Commissions for the \nProtection of the Rhine, Danube, Elbe and other rivers), \nin which EU Member States and other countries also are \ninvolved. Catchment-based approaches require engagement \nof and delivery by stakeholders at the catchment and local \nlevels in coordination with responsible authorities. At the \nsame time, engagement of all stakeholders in the catchment \nincreases the likelihood that the measures implemented \nwill be accepted. This is particularly important when trying \nto address multiple stressors for both water and land \n(DEFRA,\u00a02013).\n\nLand management and land use planning are essential for \nthe management of water resources in water-scarce areas. \nImportant wetlands, which help to store water, have been \ndrained throughout Europe. One priority should be to retain \nrainwater where it falls, enabling water to infiltrate the \nsoil surface, through the re-establishment of wetlands and \nincreased recharge of aquifers. Investment in maintaining \nand increasing soil organic matter would enable soils to \nabsorb more water, as would planning and regulating the \n\ncrops grown within a river basin, including changing to crops \nbetter adapted to dry conditions or growing a range of crops \nthat require water at different times of the year.\n\nThere are several EU water-related directives that require \nnational action plans or implementation programmes to \naddress specific issues for the protection of surface waters \nand groundwater. The implementation of those national \nplans with management solutions, such as the action plan to \navoid water pollution with pesticides from agriculture, is a \nprerequisite to achieving European targets and goals, if their \nactivities are adapted to the individual country conditions.\n\nTo sum up, key European water management challenges \nare addressed in the targets of EU strategies and \npolicy initiatives, which are further operationalised in \nthe management responses of the various water and \nenvironmental directives. Responses to tackle key water \nmanagement challenges need to become more coherent \nand harmonised, and this is one of the ambitions of the \nEuropean Green Deal. To achieve this, clear links need to \nbe established between EU strategy targets and binding \nrequirements for implementing environmental directives on \nthe ground.\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n52 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n4.3 Coherence of sectoral strategies with \nwater policy objectives\n\nEuropean water bodies are used for a variety of economic \nactivities, including navigation for trade and transport, \nagricultural and industrial processes involving water \nabstraction, hydropower production, extraction of minerals \nand aquaculture. From the assessment of their status and the \npressures and impacts on European waters (EEA, 2018b), it \nis evident that the driving forces behind whether or not they \nachieve good status are economic sector activities. Recent policy \nreviews have shown that there is still much scope to further \nmainstream environmental policy actions into sectors to reduce \nthe driving forces behind aquatic biodiversity loss (Rouillard \net\u00a0al.,\t2016). We need to ensure that economic sectors drawing \non substantial water use adopt management practices that can \nkeep water ecosystems healthy and resilient. Managing water \nin a green economy means using water in a sustainable way in \nall sectors and ensuring that ecosystems have both the quantity \nand the quality of water needed to function (EEA, 2018b).\n\nPrinciples of sustainable water management have already been \nintroduced in some sectoral activities, and the WFD has played \nan important role in taking up sustainability aspects. Several \nsustainable sector strategies have been developed in the \nlast\u00a010-15\tyears\tto\tpromote\tthe\tgrowth\tof\ta\tparticular\teconomic\t\nsector while drawing out a roadmap (or guidelines) for reducing \nthe pressures and impacts of the sector's activities on water \nresources. The following good practice examples illustrate how \nsustainable water management solutions can work in sectors.\n\nAgriculture represents one of the most water-intensive \nsectors. Excessive use of pesticides constitutes a source of \ndiffuse pollution for water, while pollution from nitrates \naffects over 17\u00a0%\tof the area of groundwater bodies. The EU \ncommon agricultural policy (CAP) regulates the main aspects \nof agricultural production across Member States. In terms of \nwater, Article 38 of the 2013 Rural Development Programme \n\nRegulation provides financial resources for agricultural \nactivities to achieve compliance with the WFD and other \nenvironmental legislation. Recent reforms of the CAP have \nled to a general decoupling of agricultural subsidies from \nproduction and the implementation of a cross-compliance \nmechanism, whereby farmers must comply with a set of \nstatutory management requirements, including those that \nrelate to water management. A range of other measures to \nimprove water quality have also been suggested in the CAP \nand national agricultural policies. These comprise increased \nmanure storage, the use of cover crops, riparian buffer \nstrips, wetland restoration and reduced use of pesticides in \nareas close to surface waters and groundwater infiltration \nhotspots. Overall, the water environment could benefit from \nmore integration of water sustainability aspects in agricultural \nproduction (see Box 4.1). The combination of innovative \ntechnologies, such as drip irrigation, and financial incentives, \nsuch as water tariffs, could be beneficial in saving water in the \nEuropean agricultural sector. In this way, private action can \ncontribute to a more sustainable agricultural sector.\n\nMining can lead to groundwater and surface water chemical \npollution, and it can also lower groundwater tables and \ndisrupt flows. These pressures threaten the status of water \necosystems well beyond business operations, as the discharge \nof pollutants is longer than the mine's lifespan. Measures that \ncan be taken to address mining impacts on water resources \n(e.g. treatment and reuse of excess water, use of chemicals \nwith low environmental impacts, barriers and drainage \nsystems to protect groundwater) generally constitute the \nbulk of best available techniques to be implemented by the \nextractive industry. Interventions and principles are laid out in \nthe EU Directive on the management of waste from extractive \nindustries (EU, 2006b), which obliges firms to issue an extractive \nwaste management plan (EWMP) in their licensing and permit \napplications. Acknowledging the impacts of mining on water \nresources and considering measures to counteract these is now \nan integrated part of mining business activities (see Box 4.2).\n\nBox 4.1 Restricting pesticide use and other sustainable farming initiatives\n\nBelgium sets out different measures to integrate pesticides with sustainable water management (NAPAN, 2014). One \nfocuses\ton\trestrictions\tin\tbuffer\tzones,\twhich\tare\tset\tat\t2-30\u00a0m depending on the size of the water body and the extent of \nland use.\n\nIn France, economically-based measures have been set up. The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational \nHealth & Safety (ANSES) has implemented an ecophyto plan, which aimed to halve pesticide use by 2018. To that end, \nenvironmental taxes on sales of pesticides were introduced.\n\nThe United Kingdom implements a catchment-sensitive farming programme. The scheme investigates the impacts of \nagricultural practices and the relevance of applied measures and draws out best practices in the sector (Thor\u00e9n, 2017).\n\nIn Ireland, farmers and growers are not allowed to apply organic or chemical fertiliser or dilute slurry when heavy rain is forecast \nwithin 48 hours or where the ground slopes steeply and a risk of water pollution exists (Amery and Schoumans, 2014).\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n53Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nBox 4.2 Acknowledging water and environmental aspects in the mining sector\n\nIn a brochure on water management, the European Aggregates Association acknowledges 'that any extraction of a mineral \nresource will potentially generate qualitative and quantitative impacts on water resources' and describes the sector's role \nin relation to river basin management planning, including limiting the impacts on water quantity and quality. In other \npublications, the European Aggregates Association focuses on gravel-processing sites and suggests different measures \nfocusing on reducing the impacts on water, including recycling of process water (European Aggregates Association, undated).\n\nIn addition, Euromines, the European metals and minerals mining industry, promotes different activities in relation to \nsustainable development and environmental protection (Euromines, 2012). Euromines requires its members to perform \nan environmental impact assessment and to continuously update their effective environmental practices. However, the \nguidelines developed by Euromines call for environmental protection from exploration to mine closure, while the impact of \nmining on water ecosystems does not end with extracting operations (Euromines, 2012).\n\nEnergy production from hydropower installations also \naffects aquatic ecosystems by altering flows of water bodies, \ndisrupting river continuity and causing degradation of \necosystems. Although most hydropower development in \nEurope has already taken place, new hydropower plants are \nbeing developed, especially in the Western Balkans, and many \nmore (especially small plants) are at the application phase \nin other parts of Europe. To balance energy production with \nthe protection of aquatic ecosystems, several strategies for \nmore sustainable hydropower projects are being promoted in \ndifferent countries and regions in Europe (see examples from \nSweden, Switzerland and the Danube in Section 3.2.3). These \ngive strategic directions for the revision of licences of existing \nhydropower plants and for the further development of new \nhydropower to mitigate or prevent hydropower affecting the \nwater environment.\n\nSustainable navigation strategies and guidelines are being \nintroduced at the EU, national and even regional/river basin \nlevels (see examples of European guidelines and national or \nregional programmes and strategies for sustainable inland \nnavigation in Section 3.2.4). These strategies and guidelines \ncall for sustainable navigation across inland waters through a \nvariety of cross-cutting criteria and measures. These include \nthe preservation of river banks, stringent fuel standards, \nmore efficient infrastructure to reduce navigation times and \nthe coupling of waterways with external activities, such as \nsustainable tourism. At the same time, the Trans-European \nTransport Network (TEN-T) seeks to integrate inland navigation \ninto sustainable means of transport in the EU by 2030 and calls \nfor European navigable waterways to attain 'good navigation \nstatus' (GNS). Although the concept of GNS evolves, and \nguidelines for its achievement (Muilerman et al., 2018) are \napplied, further efforts are needed to ensure that the WFD's \n\nobjectives of good ecological status or potential and the concept \nof GNS are coherent (CIS WFD, 2017).\n\nAquaculture affects water quality (through increased nutrient \nload and emissions of cleaning agents and medicinal products) \nand the hydromorphology of aquatic ecosystems. Aquaculture \ncan also affect wild stocks if cultured organisms escape into \nthe natural water environment. At the same time, aquaculture \ncan also act as a catalyst for ecosystem balance, e.g. by \nretaining water in the landscape and buffering extreme rainfall \npatterns with drought and flood protection through large \nponds (Jeffrey et al., 2014). Here, sustainability plans have \ngreat potential. The EU legislation in place aims to minimise \nthe adverse environmental effects of aquaculture; for instance, \nthe planning and development of new aquaculture operations \nmust be in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment \n(EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directives. \nAccording to these directives, environmental concerns must \nbe included early in the planning process to help avoid or \nminimise negative impacts. In terms of regulation, measures \nfor the aquaculture sector include consistent licensing to \ninclude mitigation measures in a coherent framework, \nas well as developing a best practices protocol to ensure \ninteroperability and clarity for aquaculture owners. Regulatory \ncodes for monitoring and sustainable management practices \n(see Box 4.3) should follow, including the use of the latest \nwater purification and monitoring technologies. Finally, \naquaculture should be integrated into further spatial planning \ntools, especially in the light of RBMPs, and sufficient polluterpays sanctions should be put in place. Aquaculture is a key \ncomponent of both the common fisheries policy and the blue \ngrowth agenda to support sustainable growth in the sector; \ntherefore, further coherence of their targets with EU water \npolicy objectives needs to be achieved.\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n54 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nBox 4.3 Code of good practice for aquaculture in \nScotland\n\nThe Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation has \napproved a code of good practice for finfish aquaculture \nto couple production with health and sustainability \naspects. The organisation has committed to sustainable \ndevelopment practices in aquaculture, ranging from \nthe sustainable use of the natural heritage to the \nsustainability of feed ingredients. One of the main \ntargets of the code is minimising the environmental \nimpact of aquaculture sites in the Scottish environment, \nincluding freshwater and seawater lochs and tanks. The \ncode is audited by independent auditors, which ensures \ncompliance with reliable sustainability standards \n(Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation, 2020).\n\nBox 4.4 'Water cent' in Germany \n\nOf the 16 German federal states, 13 have introduced \nthe water cent as a charge for water abstraction from \nsurface water and groundwater (UBA, 2012). The \nfirst federal state to introduce the water-cent did so \nin the late 1980s, while several other states followed \nafter the adoption of the Water Framework Directive \n(WFD) in 2000 (Vollmer et al., 2018). The objective of \nthis instrument is, on the one hand, to encourage \nthe conservation of precious water resources. On the \nother hand, the collected surcharges have mainly been \nused to compensate farmers for reducing their use \nof nitrogen and pesticides to reduce pollution levels \nin key drinking water sources. In at least one federal \nstate, however, plans have been announced to use the \nrevenue from the water cent (the cost of which was \nrecently increased) for flood protection measures as \nwell (S\u00fcdwest Presse, 2018).\n\nPolicies and strategies that define operations and give directions \nfor further growth of sectoral activities play a key role in ongoing \nand future developments that affect European waters. Despite \ndifferent priorities and investment cycles, over the past 15 \nyears many sectors have made attempts to acquire up-to-date \nknowledge and act on environmental aspects, including by \nimplementing sustainable water resource management. This \ndevelopment was partly set in motion by regulation and, to a \ncertain extent, by private initiatives. Some private businesses, \nfor instance those in the Scottish aquaculture industry (see Box \n4.3) or those that are part of the European Mining Association \n(see Box 4.2), have incorporated sustainability in their codes of \npractice. Economic instruments, such as a pesticide tax in France \nand an electricity surcharge to fund sustainable hydropower \nin Switzerland, further represent a relevant trend. New \ntechnologies\tused\tin\tspecific\tsectors\thave\talso\thelped,\te.g.\u00a0drip\t\nirrigation to reduce pressure on scarce water resources. More \ninitiatives of this kind are needed across all key sectors that \nhave an impact on water resources. In particular, a consistent \ncombination of multiple policy tools from the WFD, the CAP and \nthe energy and climate package is required.\n\nWater sustainability elements brought into sectoral strategies \nneed to be consistently enforced and implemented on the ground. \nHowever, in some cases, not enough information is available on \nthe extent to which sustainability aspects are being implemented. \nEnhanced resources for enforcement, capacity-building and \nincentives to transition towards sustainable business models \nare needed, especially at the local level. Cooperation at the local, \nnational and EU levels is needed for the exchange of best practices \nand sustainable technologies, so that Member States can fully \nembrace the sustainable water management transition.\n\n4.4 Funding of measures\n\nMeasures to tackle key pressures and impacts, which lead \nto failure to achieve the WFD's objectives, can only be \ncarried out with sufficient funding. Adequate financing of \n\nWFD measures is as essential for fulfilling the goals of \nthe directive as administrative and technical capacity, \nscientific knowledge and political willingness. Funding \nobstacles have been identified as the most common \nreason for delaying or not completing the implementation \nof supplementary measures in the first programmes of \nmeasures; this is also one of the key reasons for delays \nin or non-completion of basic measures at the EU level \n(EC,\u00a02019a).\n\nThe sources of funding for WFD measures are a \ncombination of EU, national, regional and municipal \nfunds and direct financing by sectors and the public as \nconsumers. For financing measures in the RBMPs, the WFD \nrelies to a certain extent on the recovery of the costs of \nwater services (WFD, Article 9), especially through the \nwater prices charged. Box 4.4 presents the example of \nthe 'water cent' in Germany, which is an additional charge \nlevied on groundwater abstraction and which is used to \nfund pollution reduction measures in agriculture. In France, \nthe river basin agencies (agences de l'eau) collect water \nabstraction and discharge charges from water users in \na given river basin and allocate those funds as grants to \nwater users in the same basin. Most of these funds initially \nfinanced piped water and the expansion and improvement \nof the sewerage network, as well as investments in \nwaste water treatment plants. In 2016, the French river \nbasin agencies received an additional mandate through \nthe biodiversity law, which requires that they also fund \nprojects with a climate adaptation and biodiversity focus \n(Tr\u00e9molet et al., 2019). In Denmark, fish care management \nis financed by funds from Danish fishing licence fees and \nincludes activities such as improving the living conditions \nand habitats of fish (Danish Fisheries Agency, 2020). \nSimilar\u00a0schemes\tare\tfound\tin\tother\tEuropean\tcountries.\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n55Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nFor several decades now, a large part of the funding available \nfor water resource management has been invested to improve \nwater quality through investments in the sewerage network and \nwaste water treatment. In a recent study, the Organisation for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated that \nall\tEU\tcountries\ttogether\tspend\ton\taverage\tEUR\u00a0100\tbillion\tper\t\nyear on water supply and sanitation (OECD, 2020). This needs to \nincrease to meet compliance with the UWWTD and the Drinking \nWater Directive. The total cumulative additional expenditure by \n2030\tfor\twater\tsupply\tand\tsanitation\tamount\tto\tEUR\u00a0289\tbillion\t\nfor the EU Member States and the United Kingdom. The main \nsources of finance for water supply and sanitation expenditure \nin the EU are revenues from water tariffs, taxes and EU funds. \nSome countries rely heavily on EU funding, which is bound to \ndecrease over time, and these countries will need to find new \nfinancing sources. When assessing Member States' capacity to \nfinance the water sector, it will be difficult for some to increase \nthe levels of public budgets allocated to water supply and \nsanitation. Although affordability constraints are mentioned to \njustify tariffs below cost recovery levels, data show that, in most \nEU Member States, more than 95\u00a0%\tof the population could \nafford to pay more (OECD, 2020).\n\nConcerning EU funding sources targeting the WFD, it is worth \nnoting that the WFD does not have its own specific EU funding for \nimplementation, and that it is instead integrated into the budget \nof the EU LIFE financing instrument for environment and climate \n(Carvalho et al., 2019). LIFE\tfunding\tamounted\tto\tEUR\u00a03.4\tbillion\t\nfor the period 2014-2020. As a result of this vast difference in \nEU funds, the success of implementation of EU water policy is \nhighly dependent on using financial instruments in other sectoral \npolicies, or 'water-mainstreaming', as well as on national funding. A \ncommon approach to water-mainstreaming has been to establish \nstandards and certification schemes to promote best practice \ntechnologies or best management practices (e.g. the Industrial \nEmissions Directive, IED). Recently, environmental safeguards \nand economic incentives were introduced in EU Structural and \nInvestment Funds, including the European Agricultural Fund for \nRural Development (EAFRD), the Cohesion Fund and the Regional \nDevelopment Fund, in a drive to reduce the environmental impact \nof economic development (Carvalho et al., 2019).\n\nIn this context, it becomes important to understand the \nsynergies between water policy and other policy areas. In \nthe CAP (reform 2014-2020), there are, for example, various \ninstruments to improve sustainability (also in terms of EU water \npolicy objectives): cross-compliance, which links certain CAP \npayments with specific environmental requirements, the green \ndirect payment scheme, which rewards farmers for respecting \nthree obligatory agricultural practices with potential indirect \nimpacts on water quality (maintenance of permanent grassland, \necological focus areas and crop diversification), and rural \ndevelopment, which provides financial incentives for actions \ngoing beyond compulsory legislation (EC 2013).\n\nFunding options from other policy areas are also of \nrelevance to hydromorphological measures, such as the \nremoval of barriers for re-establishing river connectivity, \nwhich can be funded in various ways, such as through \nthe European Fisheries Fund (EFF). It may fund measures \nrelevant to the rehabilitation of inland waters, including \nspawning grounds and migration routes for migratory \nspecies. In some countries, there are specific schemes \nfunding the removal of barriers that serve a specific sector. \nIn Denmark, for instance, many weirs were built for fish \nfarming facilities. Removing a weir at a fish farm means \nthat the farmers must change their entire water circulating \nsystem at a cost (from a flow-through to a recirculated \nsystem). To support fish farm weir removal on Danish \nstreams and rivers, a governmental finance support \nscheme was set up (AMBER Consortium, 2021).\n\nFurthermore, the new biodiversity strategy for 2030 \nenvisages\tthat\tat\tleast\tEUR\u00a020\tbillion\ta\tyear\tshould\tbe\t\nunlocked for spending on nature (EC, 2020b). As the new \nbiodiversity strategy for 2030 includes specific aims for water \necosystems\t(e.g.\tat\tleast\u00a025\t000\u00a0km\tof rivers to be restored \ninto free-flowing rivers by 2030 and restoring degraded \necosystems), part of the forthcoming funding sources should \nbe invested in water-related measures.\n\nOverall, there is a need to explore these issues in depth and \neffectively communicate further policy synergies that can be \nused to increase the scope of funding for WFD measures. For \ninstance, there is potential for more funding synergies with \nthe rural development programmes (which link to land use \nand planning issues) and the green infrastructure strategy \n(which links to the development of infrastructure in urban or \nrural settings). Urban rivers and lakes, especially, are often \nthe target of combined aquatic ecosystem restoration and \ngreen infrastructure for reducing flood risk, thereby also \nsecuring funding from multiple sources (EEA, 2016b).\n\nAs previously noted, national funding also plays a \nsignificant role in funding WFD measures. In many countries, \nthe first RBMPs were an opportunity to set up coordinated \nprogrammes to fund hydromorphological measures, which \nwere among the measures specifically requested by the WFD \nfor the first time. Examples of such national programmes \ninclude the following:\n\n\u2022 In Scotland, the Water Environment Fund was set up to \nimprove the physical condition of water bodies to meet \nWFD objectives (Box 4.5).\n\n\u2022 In Finland, the national fish pass strategy was adopted \nin 2012 to steer the construction of fish passages during \nthe first three periods of water management planning up \nto the end of 2020 (Vehanen et al., 2015).\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n56 Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\n\u2022 In Ireland, an environmental river enhancement \nprogramme was developed between 2008 and 2012 \nthat dealt in part with enhancing river morphology \n(O'Grady et al., 2013).\n\n\u2022 In Germany, the blue ribbon programme was adopted \nto promote the renaturalisation of watercourses \nand natural floodplains in secondary waterways in \nparticular. The programme (see also Section 3.2.4) \nstarted in 2017 and will run until 2050. It is estimated \nthat, for only half of the priority restoration options \nto\tbe\tcarried\tout\ton\twaterways,\ta\tbudget\tof\tEUR\u00a050\t\nmillion/year would be required (BMVI and BMU, 2018).\n\nOverall, however, public funds alone will not be sufficient to \nsupport the large number of measures needed to achieve \nthe WFD's goals. Thus, innovative financing mechanisms \nare needed, and some have already been set up in \nEuropean countries. For example, in Sweden, an industry \nfund (Hydropower Environmental Fund) was set up in 2019 \nto fund mitigation measures in the hydropower sector \nrelated to the country's new national plan for the revision \nof hydropower licences in the next 20 years (SWAM, 2019). \nThe fund consists of contributions from all of the main \nhydropower producers in the country and will support \nmitigation measures at hydropower plants that could not \notherwise afford this type of interventions.\n\nIn addition, the EU has been developing standards to \nfurther link financial investment with environmental \nprotection (see the action plan for financing sustainable \ngrowth (EC, 2018a)), which could restrict investment in \nsectors that cause impacts on water bodies (e.g. transport, \nenergy production). Building on the 2018 action plan, the \nEU's renewed sustainable finance strategy-will provide a \nroadmap with new actions to increase private investment in \nsustainable projects to support the different actions set out \nin the European Green Deal and to manage and integrate \nclimate and environmental risks into our financial system \n(EC, 2020d).\n\nAll in all, as adequate financing of measures is essential for \nfulfilling the goals of the WFD, it is key to mobilise, as far as \npossible, additional funding from EU, national and other \nsources. EU funds targeted at WFD measures are limited; \ntherefore, the success of implementation depends on \nidentifying synergies and financing opportunities with other \npolicy areas, including sectoral ones (e.g. agricultural policy, \nfisheries policy, biodiversity policy). Furthermore, public \nfunds (EU and national) need to be complemented with \nother innovative financing mechanisms, especially those \nthat\tinvolve\tindustrial\tand\tother\tprivate\tsector\u00a0partners.\n\n4.5\t Measures\twith\tmultiple\tbenefits\n\nMeasures with multiple benefits can be understood as actions \nthat are beneficial to the achievement of the environmental \nrequirements of more than one policy instrument or to the \nimprovement of one or more ecosystems (e.g. groundwater, \nsurface waters, floodplain, soil). Furthermore, their combined \neffect can lead to improved functioning of ecosystem services, \nfor example self-purification, water storage or nutrient \nsequestration, and recreation.\n\nSeveral water management measures can deliver multiple \nbenefits, such as river and floodplain restoration, integrated \nfreshwater and coastal zone management, or projects such \nas 'Room for the River' (see Box 4.6). Buffer strips can also \ndeliver multiple benefits by reducing nutrient input by erosion \nin surface waters and, on a larger scale, reducing nutrient \ninput into marine waters as well as increasing terrestrial \nbiodiversity. Extensification of land use reduces nutrient and \n\nBox 4.5 The Water Environment Fund in Scotland\n\nThe aim of the Scottish Government's Water \nEnvironment Fund (SEPA, 2021) is to improve the \nphysical condition of water bodies to meet the \nobjectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). \nThe programme also aims to bring wider benefits to \ndesignated nature conservation sites, local fisheries and \nangling opportunities, community amenity and urban \ngreen space.\n\nLaunched in 2008, the Water Environment Fund \nprovided\tfunding\tof\tmore\tthan\tGBP\u00a014\tmillion\t\n(EUR\u00a016.3\tmillion)\tbetween\t2013\tand\t2018\taround\tthe\t\ncountry. It is administered by the Scottish Environment \nProtection Agency, which works in partnership with local \nauthorities, land managers, fishery trusts and angling \nassociations, local communities and volunteers. One of \nthe objectives of the programme is to build a greater \nunderstanding of the benefits of river restoration in \nScotland and the techniques available to achieve it.\n\nThe programme has led to river channel restoration \n(including remeandering), floodplain afforestation, the \nremoval of flood embankments, wetland and peatland \nrestoration, the removal of culverts and barriers to fish \nmigration, and the elimination of non-native species \nalong river banks. The fund also promotes catchmentscale restoration and explores synergies with natural \nflood management.\n\nSource: SEPA (2021).\n\f\nCross-cutting issues for key European water management\u00a0challenges\n\n57Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nincluding the good status objective of the WFD and national \nwater policies (EEA, 2010).\n\nNature-based solutions aim for, for example, multi-functional \nnature-based catchment management and ecosystem \nrestoration. A list of some 300 different nature-based measures \nand their linkage to ecosystem services shows how diverse the \nuse and their applicability can be in several sectors, such as \nflood protection, climate change adaptation, sustainable urban \ndevelopment and water management (Sutherland et al., 2014).\n\nIn addition to establishing linkages between the WFD, the \nFloods Directive and nature conservation policy, measures \nwith multiple benefits can also contribute to linking to the \nMarine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) (EU, 2008). This \nis mainly because of the planning and implementation of \nmeasures as part of the RBMPs to improve water quality in \ncoastal areas and for the benefit of the marine environment. \nIn the second RBMPs, some 70\u00a0%\tof all river basin districts \nreported a link between the WFD and the MSFD; they also \nindicated a large number of measures listed under the WFD \nas also relevant for reaching the objectives of the MSFD, in \nparticular measures to reduce nutrient pollution from both \ndiffuse and point sources and the reduction of hazardous \nsubstances (EC, 2019a).\n\nOverall, a wide variety of multi-benefit measures are \nalready available. They can help improve and coordinate \nthe achievement of objectives across policies and can also \nmobilise diverse sources of funding for measures. Multi-benefit \nmeasures are suitable to shift the focus of management from \nsingle-issue solutions towards an approach based on protecting \nand re-establishing various ecosystem services to effectively \naddress key European water management challenges.\n\npollution inflow into soil and groundwater, improves the local \nhydrological regime, avoids the impacts of droughts and makes \nthe landscape more pleasant for recreation. Furthermore, water \nsaving and conservation bring additional benefits by ensuring \nsufficient water for environmental needs and reducing pollution \ndischarges and energy use.\n\nMulti-benefit measures are also related to source reduction \napproaches. Within European strategies, such as the Eight \nEnvironment Action Programme, the biodiversity strategy \nor Farm to Fork strategy, the goals are sustainable resource \nefficiency and integrated nutrient management. Certain \nmulti-benefit measures combine pollution reduction with \nthe reuse of resources, for example the reuse of phosphorus \nretained in waste water or sewage sludge and their use in \nagriculture. This is also in line with the goals of the European \nGreen Deal on circular economy actions.\n\nManagement measures that work with nature, and not against \nit, often result in a win-win situation. Multi-benefit measures \nserving nature conservation and water policy objectives \n(from the WFD) can be related to the protection of aquatic \nspecies listed in the annexes of the Habitats Directive, such \nas the sturgeon, the eel or the salmon, which have high \nprotection status. A prerequisite for such migratory fish \nspecies is longitudinal continuity of rivers and connection to \nthe sea. In addition, this is in line with the targets of the Eel \nRegulation (EC, 2007) and the target of the new biodiversity \nstrategy to achieve 25 000\u00a0km\tof\tfree-flowing rivers by 2030. \nMulti-benefit measures to restore longitudinal continuity of \nrivers for migratory fish species are, for example, the removal \nof dams and obstacles. To also ensure their reproduction \nin rivers and streams, habitat improvement is crucial by, \nfor example, focusing on sediment improvement to restore \nspawning\u00a0grounds.\n\nNatural water retention measures (NWRMs) can be used as \nmeasures to meet the requirements of the WFD, the Floods \nDirective and climate adaptation. According to EC (2014) \n'Natural Water Retention Measures (NWRM) are multi-functional \nmeasures that aim to protect and manage water resources and \naddress water-related challenges by restoring or maintaining \necosystems\u00a0\u2026'. In a recent EU project, about 45 NWRMs with \nmultiple benefits for urban areas, forests, rivers and agricultural \nareas were identified and linked to ecosystem service benefits; \nthey were also illustrated in several European case studies (NWRM \nproject, 2021).\n\nA multi-benefit measure that is increasingly acknowledged for \nits importance is the restoration of floodplains, which can both \nreduce flood risk and improve the ecological and quantitative \nstatus of waters. Natural floodplains act as water retention \nsystems and support the ecological flow. Measures to restore \nfloodplains can contribute to achieving many objectives, \n\nBox 4.6 Room for the river in the Netherlands\n\nOne example of implementing nature-based solutions \nin the context of improving risk management and the \nresilience of aquatic ecosystems is the 'Room for the \nRiver' programme in the Netherlands. The strategy \ndeveloped focuses on making more space for water \nto improve flood prevention by lowering high-water \nlevels and to improve the spatial quality of the area, \nreconnecting people and rivers. Several projects were \ncarried out at 30 locations in the Netherlands; these \nincluded relocating dykes, constructing high-water \nchannels and lowering floodplains (Dutch Water \nSector,\u00a02019).\tFor\texample,\tin\tthe\tcity\tof\tNijmegen\t\na\u00a0350\u00a0m-long\tdyke\twas\trelocated\tand\tan\tancillary\t\nchannel was built. This project offers multiple benefits, \nincluding\treducing\tthe\twater\tlevel\tby\t35\u00a0cm;\tit\talso\t\nbrings new potential for the development of the city by \ncreating an urban river park with potential for recreation \nand nature (EC, 2015). The total costs for this project \nwere\tEUR\u00a0360\tmillion.\n\f\n\u00a9 Bojan Bencic, WaterPix/EEA\n\f\f\nDrivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview 60\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAbbreviation Name\n\nBOD Biological oxygen demand\n\nCAP Common agricultural policy\n\nDOC Dissolved organic carbon\n\nEASIN European Network on Invasive Alien Species\n\nEEA European Environment Agency\n\nEFF European Fisheries Fund\n\nE-PRTR European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register\n\nEU European Union\n\nEWD Extractive Waste Directive\n\nEWMP Extractive waste management plan\n\nFRMP Flood risk management plan\n\nGNS Good navigation status\n\nIAS Invasive alien species\n\nIED Industrial Emissions Directive\n\nMSFD Marine Strategy Framework Directive\n\nNBS Nature based solutions\n\nNWRM Natural water retention measure\n\nPAH Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\n\nPFASs Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\n\nRBMP River basin management plan\n\nTEN-T Trans-European Transport Network\n\nUWWTD Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive\n\nWFD Water Framework Directive\n\nWISE Water Information System for Europe\n\f\n61Drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges \u2014 A European overview \n\nReferences\n\nAMBER Consortium, 2020, 'The Amber barrier atlas \u2014 A panEuropean database of artificial instream barriers', (https://\namber.international/european-barrier-atlas) accessed  \nMarch 14, 2021.\n\nAMBER Consortium, 2021, 'Small barriers in Denmark and \nthe UK', (https://amber.international/portfolio-item/smallbarriers-in-denmark-and-the-uk) accessed March 15, 2021.\n\nAmery, F. and Schoumans, O., 2014, Agricultural phosphorus \nlegislation in Europe, Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries \nResearch, Merelbeke, Belgium.\n\nAmoros, C. and Roux, A.

Of all the Earth\u2019s water, 96.5 % is contained within the oceans as salt water, whereas the remaining 3.5 % is freshwater \u2014 lakes, rivers, groundwater and ice. Good management of this limited and precious resource is indispensable for the well-being of people and nature.\nThroughout history, people have settled close to rivers, lakes and coastlines. Rivers and streams brought clean water and took away waste. As human settlements grew, so did their use of clean water and discharge of polluted water. From the 18th century onwards, Europe\u2019s water bodies also started receiving pollutants from industry.\nWith sewage systems, waste water treatment facilities and the regulation of pollutants from industry and agriculture, Europe has come a long way in reducing emissions to water bodies. Nevertheless, water pollution continues to be a problem, with over-exploitation, physical alterations and climate change continuing to affect the quality and the availability of water.\nAbout 88 % of Europe\u2019s freshwater use comes from rivers and groundwater. The rest comes from reservoirs (about 10 %) and lakes (less than 2 %). Like any other vital resource or living organism, water can come under pressure. This can happen when demand for water exceeds its supply or when pollution reduces its quality.\nWaste water treatment and reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus losses from agriculture have led to significant improvements in water quality. However, according to the EEA\u2019s most recent data, only 44 % of surface waters in Europe achieve good or high ecological status, partly because of pollution. The situation of Europe\u2019s groundwater is somewhat better. About 75 % of Europe\u2019s groundwater areas has a \u2018good chemical status\u2019.\nThe current condition of Europe\u2019s seas \u2014 from the Baltic to the Mediterranean \u2014 is generally poor, according to the EEA\u2019sassessment. Despite some positive developments achieved through regional cooperation, a range of pressures from historic and current human activities could cause irreversible damage to marine ecosystems.\nMoreover, the EEA\u2019s report onshowed that all four regional seas in Europe have a large-scale contamination problem, ranging from 96 % of the assessed area in the Baltic Sea and 91 % in the Black Sea to 87 % in the Mediterranean Sea and 75 % in the North\u2011East Atlantic Ocean. The contamination problem is mainly caused by synthetic chemicals and heavy metals originating from human activities both on land and at sea.\nSimilarly, the EEA\u2019s report onshowed that eutrophication as a consequence of nutrient losses, mainly from agriculture, is another large-scale problem, especially in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea.\nCoastal and maritime activities, such as fishing, shipping, tourism, aquaculture and the extraction of oil and gas, cause multiple pressures on the marine environment, including pollution. Marine litter is present in all marine ecosystems, with plastics, metals, cardboard and other waste accumulating on shorelines, the seabed and surface waters. Ships and offshore activities also cause underwater noise pollution, which can negatively affect marine life.\nMuch has been done across Europe to enable the collection and treatment of urban waste water. According to EEA data, most European countries were collecting and treating sewage at the tertiary level from most of their population by 2017. Still, in a number of European countries less than 80 % of the population was connected to public urban waste water treatment systems.\nMeanwhile, existing infrastructure requires maintenance and new pressures require substantial investments, including adapting to climate change, providing improved waste water facilities and tackling new concerns, such as medicines or the so\u2011called mobile chemicals in waste water.\nIn addition to point source pollution from industry and waste water treatment plants, water bodies also suffer from diffuse pollution, for example from transport, agriculture, forestry and rural dwellings. Pollutants that are first released to air and soil often also end up in water bodies.\nIntensive agriculture relies on fertilisers to increase crop yields. These fertilisers often work by introducing nitrogen, phosphorus and other chemicals into the soil. Nitrogen is a chemical element abundant in nature and is essential for plant growth.\nHowever, some of the nitrogen intended for crops is not taken up by plants. The amount of fertiliser applied may be more than the plant can absorb or it may not be applied during the plant\u2019s growing period. This excess nitrogen finds its way into water bodies and there it boosts the growth of certain water plants and algae in a process known as eutrophication. This extra growth depletes the oxygen in the water, rendering it uninhabitable for other animal and plant species.\nPesticides used in agriculture aim to protect crops from invasive pests, ensuring crop growth. However, these effects can occur beyond the intended target, harming other species and reducing biodiversity. Often, these chemicals end up in water bodies.\nLower economic activity during lockdowns is likely to lead to lower emissions to water from industry, while emissions from schools and workplaces are likely to shift towards households. There may be less water stress in specific areas in Europe, depending on the impacts on agriculture and energy production. Reduced tourism is also likely to lead to lower emissions to water along European coasts and in other tourist destinations.\nFind out more: www.eea.europa.eu/post-corona-planet/explore.\nPlastics have become integral to almost every aspect of our lives, and the issue of plastics entering our waterways, lakes and seas is dramatic and well documented.\nClearing visible plastic litter from rivers, beaches and even the sea might still be possible but, with time and exposure to sunlight, plastic waste fragments into ever-smaller pieces, known as micro- and nanoplastics. Waste water treatment plants can filter out most of these tiny particles but the remaining sludge is often spread on land, with plastic particles sometimes being washed into water bodies by rainfall. These smallest particles are hardly visible to the eye and their impacts on nature and our health are still poorly understood.\nMany plastics are also highly adsorbent, attracting other contaminants. As noted in the EEA report on the, concentrations of contaminants in pieces of microplastic can be thousands of times greater than in ambient seawater. This exposes marine life to harmful chemicals, which, in turn, can end up on our plates.\nIn the past decades, Europe has made significant efforts to improve water quality, treat waste water and protect marine and freshwater habitats and species. Today, EU policies address a wide range of issues affecting water, such as drinking water, urban waste water, bathing water quality, single-use plastics, industrial emissions and hazardous chemicals. Overarching programmes and legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, strengthen these specific pieces of EU legislation.\nHowever, efforts to move towards zero pollution will require a major focus on water as part of the European Green Deal\u2019s zero pollution action plan, including aiming to restore the natural functions of groundwater, surface water, marine and coastal waters, tackling pollution from urban runoff, and addressing new concerns, such as microplastics and chemicals.\nAs one of the key components of the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy aims to significantly reduce the agricultural use and risk of chemical pesticides, the use of antibiotics and fertiliser losses to the environment, for example through integrated pest management and an integrated nutrient management action plan. The EU 2030 biodiversity strategy also supports similar objectives.\nTo help tackle the plastics problem, the EU has already proposed a plastics strategy that aims to \u2018transform the way products are designed, produced, used, and recycled in the EU\u2019. Meanwhile, consumer attitudes are changing and innovations mean that some items previously made from plastics can now be produced from cellulose sourced from recycled paper, textiles, plants or algae.\nWaste water treatment and reductions in nutrient losses from agriculture have led to significant improvements in water quality in Europe. However, many of Europe\u2019s freshwater bodies are still not doing well and the condition of Europe\u2019s seas is generally poor, partly because of pollution.\nSources: EEA 2018 water assessment; EEA report - Marine messages II; EEA report - State of Europe\u2019s seas; EEA infographic.\nWater and marine environment:\nwww.eea.europa.eu/themes/water\nSOER 2020, Chapter 4 on freshwater: www.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer-2020/chapter-04_soer2020-freshwater/view\nSOER 2020, Chapter 6 on the marine environment: www.eea.europa.eu/publications/soer-2020/chapter-06_soer2020-marine-environment/view\nEEA Signals 2018 \u2014 Water is life: www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2018-content-list\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2020/articles/ensuring-clean-waters-for-people or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 10:49 PM\nFiled under: signals signals2020\nFiled under: signals, signals2020\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

It aims at concerting efforts to achieve \na cleaner Mediterranean by 2020. At its core, H2020 \naddresses the main land-based sources of pollution: \nmunicipal waste, wastewater and industrial \npollution affecting the environmental status of the \nMediterranean.\n\nThe first phase of the H2020 initiative (2007-2014) \nculminated in the publication of the first regional \nassessment 'Horizon 2020 Mediterranean report \u2014 \nToward shared environmental information systems' \n(EEA and UNEP/MAP, 2014) and its presentation at \nthe Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) Ministerial \nMeeting on Environment and Climate Change, held \non 13 May 2014 in Athens, Greece (EU, 2014b). It \nprovided a solid baseline for further cooperation with \nthe European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) South \ncountries (1) in terms of developing and sustaining the \nregular production and sharing of quality assessed \nenvironmental data, indicators and information. \nThis key achievement was made possible through \nthe EU-funded regional project 'Towards a Shared \nEnvironmental Information System (SEIS) in the \nEuropean neighbourhood' (ENPI-SEIS), implemented \nby the European Environment Agency (EEA) between \n2010 and 2015, in partnership with the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme/Mediterranean Action Plan \n(UNEP/MAP).\n\nIn 2014, the above-mentioned UfM meeting in 2014 \ngave a new impetus to this cooperation, calling for \ngreater collaboration on reducing marine pollution, \nwhich led to the launch of the second phase of the \nHorizon 2020 initiative (2015-2020). The complementary \nactions of the UfM actively supporting effective \n\n1 Section A: The H2020 Assessment \nFramework \n\npollution-prevention projects and the commitment of \nthe Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention to \nprotect the fragile ecosystems of the Mediterranean \nfrom the increasing pressures from human activities \nshape the operative context of this ambitious initiative. \n\nThe H2020 supports and complements the \nimplementation of other commitments under the \nBarcelona Convention (Barcelona Convention, 1995), \nfor example in targeting pollution 'hot spots' that \nhave been identified by countries in their national \naction plans (NAPs). It enables synergies with the \necosystem approach (EcAp), which aims to achieve \na\u00a0good environmental status (GES) for the Mediterranean \nSea and coast (UNEP/MAP, 2008), and with its regional \nIntegrated Monitoring and Assessment Programme \n(IMAP) (UNEP/MAP, 2016a). Such alignment ensures the \noptimisation and use of data and information to serve \ndifferent purposes, the organisation of information in \na systematic and harmonised manner, and promoting \na holistic and integrated assessment of the progress \nrelated to the priority themes, in line with the SEIS \nprinciples (see Box 1.1). The EU-funded implementation \nproject European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) \nShared Environmental Information System (SEIS) \u2014 \nENI SEIS II South Support Mechanism (2016-2020) \nsupports improved availability and access to relevant \nenvironmental information to the benefit of effective \nand knowledge-based policymaking in the European \nNeighbourhood South region. It is building on the \nachievements of the previous ENPI-SEIS project while \nputting into effect the review and monitoring (RM) \ncomponent (2) of the H2020 initiative.  \n\n1.2 The 'source-to-sea' paradigm to \nassess progress towards a cleaner \nMediterranean\n\nSince 2008, the H2020 assessment framework \ntakes into account the concept of the EcAp as the \n\n(1) Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria*, Tunisia.  \n*Cooperation with Syria is currently suspended. However, when data is available, it is included in the analysis.\n\n(2) The H2020 RM subgroup is one of the three H2020 initiative components. The other two subgroups are:  Investments for Pollution Reduction \nand Prevention (PRPI) and Capacity Building (CB).\n\f\nSection A: The H2020 Assessment Framework\n\n6 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n \nBox 1.1 The seven principles underpinning a shared environmental information system (SEIS)\n\n1) Information should be managed as close as possible to its source; \n\n2) Information should be collected once, and shared with others for many purposes; \n\n3)   Information should be readily available to public authorities and enable them to easily fulfil their legal reporting \nobligations;\n\n4)   Information should be readily accessible to end-users, primarily public authorities at all levels, to enable them to assess \nin a timely fashion the state of the environment and the effectiveness of their policies, and to design new policy; \n\n5)   Information should also be accessible to enable end-users, both public authorities and citizens, to make comparisons \nat the appropriate geographical scale (e.g. countries, cities, catchments areas) and to participate meaningfully in the \ndevelopment and implementation of environmental policy; \n\n6)   Information should be fully available to the general public, after due consideration of the appropriate level of \naggregation and subject to appropriate confidentiality constraints, and at the national level in the relevant national \nlanguage(s); \n\n7)   Information sharing and processing should be supported through common, free open source software tools.\n\nguiding principle for the MAP Programme of Work \nwith Decision IG.17/6 (UNEP/MAP, 2008). Although \nit is often strongly linked to the achievement of GES \nthrough the implementation of IMAP, EcAp has been \nmainstreamed in all workstreams of the UNEP/MAP \nBarcelona Convention, including work related to the \nmanagement of human activities, their pressures \nand impacts. The EBM approach is also the backbone \nof European Directives, such as the Marine Strategy \nFramework Directive (MSFD, EC, 2008) and the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD, EC, 2000). It goes beyond \nexamining single issues, species, or ecosystem \nfunctions in isolation. Instead, it recognises: (1) marine \necosystems as rich mixes of interacting elements with \nmarine biodiversity at the core, supplying ecosystem \nservices; (2) the interaction with human activities and \npressures; and (3) socio-economic systems and support \nfor human well-being. Under the realm of the EcAp, the \nmanagement of human activities and their pressures \nrequires a shift to a more systemic, integrated and \nholistic approach. \n\nThe source-to-sea approach (Berggren and Liss \nLymer, 2016; Matthews and Stretz, 2019) is the \nprincipal assessment framework used to structure \nthe assessment of the three H2020 thematic areas \n(see\u00a0Section C). It provides the most appropriate \nframework for assessing the land-based sources \nalong the source-to-sea continuum (Figure 1.1). By \nusing this framework, the link between marine litter \nand poor prevention and management practices for \n\nmunicipal solid waste is very clear. The deterioration \nin coastal water quality can be related to point source \ndischarges of untreated wastewater within the coastal \nhydrological basin, in line with UNEP/MAP guidance \non the Integrative Methodological Framework (IMF) \n(3) for the sustainable management of the ecological \ncontinuum constituted by the coastal zone, river basin \nand coastal aquifer. Furthermore, contaminated hot \nspots can be traced to hazardous waste and emissions \nfrom industries. By considering that flows from land \nto sea are linked to one common system and actively \nfocusing\u00a0on the sources of pollution, the pressures, \nrather than downstream fixes, a more holistic approach \nto pollution management can be achieved. In the \ncurrent assessment, this paradigm proved particularly \nvaluable in the conceptual framework. However, due \nto the data gaps along the continuum, the quantitative \nassessment of issues from source-to-sea remains \na\u00a0challenge.\n\nIn its geographical scope, the source-to-sea paradigm \nincorporates the marine and land parts of coastal zones \nas defined in the Integrated Coastal Zone Management \n(ICZM) Protocol, the ultimate objective of which is to \nestablish a common framework for the integrated \nmanagement of coastal zones. It also includes the \npressures from marine and maritime activities, \nencompassing the environmental dimension of the \nblue economy. While these sectors create pressures on \nthe seas, most of them rely on healthy and productive \nseas as a prerequisite for their sustainable operation \n\n(3) http://pap-thecoastcentre.org/pdfs/IMF%20Guidelines.pdf; https://iwlearn.net/documents/30017\n\f\nSection A: The H2020 Assessment Framework\n\n7Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nand use of their resources. Pressures from these \nactivities will result in cumulative impacts in the system, \nin addition to the pressures the Mediterranean is \nalready under (see Box 1.2). Thus, a transition to a \nsustainable green and blue economy is an objective \nfor the region under the Mediterranean Strategy for \nSustainable Development 2015-2025 (UNEP/MAP, \n2016b) which will ensure environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment of the marine and coastal area. This \nwas further recognised during the UfM Ministerial \nConference on Blue Economy (EU, 2015b), after which \n\nthe Working Group on Blue Economy was set up to \nimplement the Ministerial Declaration on Blue Economy \n(EU, 2015b). Development of a blue economy and the \nsubsequent increase in the competition for maritime \nresources requires adequate spatial management of \nMediterranean waters through marine spatial planning \n(Directive 2014/89/EU; EU, 2014). Finally, sustainable \nuse of the seas and reduced pressure from human \nactivities, both in the marine space and catchment area, \nare prerequisites for achieving GES under the MSFD \n(2008/56/EC; EC, 2008). \n\nSource:  ETC/ICM-Deltares. \n\nFigure 1.1  Source-to-sea schematic with H2020 indicators for each thematic area\n\nWASTE\n\nWATER\n\nINDUSTRIAL \nEMISSIONS\n\n1.A1.B\n\n2.A.2 2.A.1\n\n2.C.1\n\n2.B.1 2.B.2\n\n2.B.3\n\n6.16.26.3 6.4\n\n3.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n5.2\n\n5.1\n\n3.2\n\n1.A\n\n1.B\n\n2.A.2\n\n2.A.1\n\n2.C.1\n\n2.B.1\n\n2.B.3\n\n6.1\n\n6.2\n\n6.3\n\n6.4\n\n3.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n5.2\n\n5.1\n\n3.2\n\nMunicipal waste generation & composition\n\nPlastic waste generation per capita\n\nWaste collection coverage\n\nWaste captured by formal waste sector\n\n% of waste to uncontrolled dump sites\n\nUncontrolled dump sites in coastal areas\n\nWaste going to dump sites in coastal areas\n\n% of plastic waste generated that is recycled\n\nShare of population with access to safely \nmanaged sanitation systems\n\nShare of population with access to improved \nsanitation systems\n\nVolume of municipal wastewater collected \nand treated\n\nVolume of treated wastewater reused\n\nRelease of nutrients from municipal effluent\n\nNutrient concentrations in coastal waters\n\nBathing water quality\n\nRelease of nutrients from industrial sectors\n\nRelease of toxic substances from industrial sectors\n\nIndustrial hazardous waste disposed in\nenvironmentally sound manner\n\nCompliance measures aimed at reduction of \npollutants generated by industrial sector\n\nU2.B.2\n\nWaste Water  Industrial emissions\n\f\nSection A: The H2020 Assessment Framework\n\n8 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nBox 1.2  The Mediterranean, an ecosystem under cumulative pressures\n\nAmong the four European seas, the Mediterranean ecosystem is particularly rich in biodiversity compared to other regional \nseas and hosts a variety of ecosystem services upon which society depends (Culhane et al., 2020). While pollution is one of \nthe main pressures impacting the Mediterranean ecosystem, several others are causing cumulative impacts (ETC/ICM, 2019; \nEEA, 2014, and the Marine Messages II, 2019). \n\nMany of the pressures on the Mediterranean ecosystem go beyond pollution and many are the result of human activities \nalong coastal areas and in marine waters. For example, a major threat specific to the Mediterranean (and the Black Sea) \nconcerns fishery-related activities, with 88\u00a0% of stocks being overfished. The impacts of fisheries go beyond stocks; they \naffect the seafloor habitats, including benthic fauna damage, and contribute to marine litter and microplastic generation. \nThis continued pressure is on already largely degraded fishing stocks in the Mediterranean, compared to the EU Atlantic and \nBaltic Sea, where fishing pressures have been reduced. Habitat loss due to coastal developments put an additional pressure \non the system, in particular in fast-developing coastal tourism sites along the Mediterranean. Other pressures come from \nmaritime activities, such as marine oil and gas extraction, which are prevalent in the Mediterranean Sea (EEA, 2019e). \n\nFurthermore, alien species invading the Mediterranean can severely impact native communities, significantly impacting \naquatic ecosystems through processes which are further enhanced by the rise in seawater temperature as a consequence \nof climate change. In relation to other regional seas, the Mediterranean has the highest number of invasive species \n(EEA, 2019e). Finally, the impact of climate change, sea-level rise and heatwave shocks put additional pressure on an \nalready heavily impacted ecosystem. The need for a holistic approach and ecosystem-based management addressing \nthese pressures and impacts is becoming more urgent, due to our dependency on a well-functioning marine and coastal \necosystem for its natural capital and the development of a sustainable blue economy.\n\nThe source-to-sea assessment framework \nwas combined with the commonly used \nDriver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) analytical \nframework (EEA, 1999). This framework was adopted by \nthe EEA as an extension of the Pressure-State-Responses \nmodel developed by the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD). Although it \nis commonly used to structure thematic and other \nintegrated assessments, describing the entire causal \nchain from driving forces to impacts and responses is \na complex task. Often, the focus lies in the assessment \nof subcomponents, for example, the pressure-state \nrelationship. In the current H2020 assessment, the drivers \nof change, including the driving forces (key socio-economic \ntrends, economic growth, geopolitical issues, climate \nchange, etc.) and responses (policies, investments, \nmonitoring, etc.) collectively, are put at the forefront \n(see\u00a0Section 2). Being the second H2020 regional \nassessment, it is important to first assess those key \naspects that drive change and which provide the necessary \ncontext for better understanding the observed trends in \npressures and the progress achieved (see Section 3). \n\n1.3 Framing the policy boundaries\n\nBeing geographically located at the crossroads between \nEurope, Northern Africa and the Middle East, the \n\nmanagement of the Mediterranean Sea is subject \nto a complex and heterogenous policy landscape. \nSeveral instruments stemming from different policy \nprocesses are in place to help make human activities \nmore sustainable and protect the sea from land-based \npollution sources. \n\nThe Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the \nMarine Environment and the Coastal Region of the \nMediterranean was adopted in 1995 to replace the \nMediterranean Action Plan of 1975. This was the \nfirst-ever Regional Seas Programme under the UNEP \numbrella. It has been adopted by 22 Contracting \nParties (4) and provides the main regional legal and \ninstitutional framework to protect the Mediterranean \nmarine and coastal environment while boosting \nregional and national plans to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. On the northern shores, a set of \nenvironmentally related European Directives have \nbeen transposed and implemented by the EU Member \nStates, of which Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, \nItaly, Malta, Slovenia and Spain are also Contracting \nParties of the Barcelona Convention. Mediterranean \ncountries are committed to global agendas, such as \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and \nare signatories to international conventions, such as \nthe Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary \nMovements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal \n\n(4)  Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, European Community, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, \nMonaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.\n\f\nSection A: The H2020 Assessment Framework\n\n9Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nand the Rotterdam Convention on promoting shared \nresponsibilities in relation to the importation of \nhazardous chemicals. The ensemble of policies, \nstrategies, protocols, regional plans, initiatives and \nassociated targets, ranging from global, to EU regions \nand then to the Mediterranean region, are presented \nin\u00a0Table 1.1 below.\n\nThe H2020 initiative has direct synergies with the \nStrategic Action Programme to address pollution \nfrom land-based activities (SAP-MED) which sets \nout 33 regional pollution-reduction targets to be \nachieved by 2025. It is complemented by the Protocol \nfor the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against \nPollution from Land-Based Sources and Activities \n(LBS Protocol). This provides for the Contracting \nParties to take all appropriate measures to prevent, \nabate, combat and eliminate, to the fullest possible \nextent, pollution of the Mediterranean Sea. In this \ncontext, the Contracting Parties have negotiated and \nadopted 10 regional plans since 2009, including the \nregional plan on the reduction of biochemical oxygen \ndemand (BOD5) from urban wastewater and marine \nlitter management, both with direct links to the \nH2020 initiative priority areas. Recently, a mid-term \nevaluation of the implementation of existing regional \nplans has been undertaken, and the main elements \nfor the six new pollution reduction regional plans are \ncurrently being developed. The latter will address \nmunicipal wastewater treatment, sewage sludge \nmanagement, agriculture nutrients management, \naquaculture nutrients management, urban storm \nwater management and an update of the marine \nlitter\u00a0regional plan.\n\nIn view of implementing the LBS Protocol and its \nrespective SAP-MED, countries drafted and adopted \ntheir first NAPs in 2004-2005 and updated them in \n2015. The NAPs 2016-2025 comprise legally binding \nprogrammes of measures and timetables set out \nby the countries to achieve GES. They refer to a set \nof proposed indicators to assess the progress and \neffectiveness of the implementation of the LBS Protocol \nat the national level, complementing the H2020 core set \nof indicators developed at the regional level.\n\nUnder the EcAp umbrella, the development of an IMAP \nwas that adopted at COP 19 in 2016 (Decision IG.22/7; \nUNEP/MAP, 2016a). IMAP lays down the principles, \nstandard guidelines and approaches for the integrated \nmonitoring of biodiversity, non-indigenous species, \npollution and marine litter, coast and hydrography, \nthrough its 27 common indicators as its framework. \nIt\u00a0has direct synergies with H2020 particularly through \nthe ecological objectives of eutrophication (EO5), \ncontaminants (EO9) and marine litter (EO10) and their \nrespective common indicators. \n\nThe Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment (MSSD 2016-2025) was adopted by \nthe Barcelona Convention Contracting Parties in \n2016 with the aim of translating the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development at the regional, subregional \nand national levels (UNEP/MAP, 2016b). By addressing \nthe interactions between socio-economic and \nenvironmental goals, the MSSD is the key regional \nintegrative policy framework focusing on aspects \nrelated to drivers. \n\nThe overview in Table 1.1 clearly shows that the key \nHorizon 2020 thematic areas are covered by a broad \nrange of instruments, with ambitious visions and \nobjectives. However, the Horizon 2020 initiative itself \ndid not define targets against which progress can be \nmeasured. The Mediterranean region is the only region \nwith legally binding instruments providing for integrated \ncoastal management and with an ambitious framework \nstrategy for sustainable development. While these \ninstruments are aiming for an integrated approach, \nthe implementation of such approaches remains \na\u00a0challenge. There is tension between how these visions \nand goals are interpreted and how the objectives can be \nachieved through effective implementation measures. \nClosing this implementation gap is critical for the region \nnot only to fully embrace a source-to-sea approach \nbut also to achieve a clean Mediterranean. To help to \nclose this gap, institutions across different policies must \nact in a truly coordinated way, with targets measuring \nprogress towards these objectives clearly defined \n(within a realistic time frame which allows  management \nmeasures to deliver) and regularly monitored (reliable \nmeasurements and high-quality data on environmental \ntrends and progress to provide for and lay down the \nfoundations for effective\u00a0policymaking \u2014 a lack of \nprogress would trigger further measures). This does not \nrequire new policies/legislation, but rather empowering \npublic institutions to adequately address politically \nagreed commitments.\n\n1.4 The second H2020 Mediterranean \nassessment\n\nThe second H2020 Mediterranean Assessment \ncomprises three products (Figure 1.2): a synthesis \nreport, an H2020 Mediterranean indicator-based \ntechnical report (this document) and national indicator \nfactsheets.

The \nindicator factsheets delivered by the MED South \ncountries have served as input to the Mediterranean \nindicator-based technical report. \n\nThis assessment is not the product of a desk study but \nthe result of a multifaceted collaborative process to set \nup a regular review and reporting mechanism in the \nregion. Such a mechanism required the development \nof regional data infrastructure and the setting up \nof appropriate governance systems, fully guided by \nthe three SEIS pillars: content, infrastructure and \ngovernance (see Box 1.1). This is in line with the UfM \nAthens Ministerial Declaration (EU, 2014b) which \nemphasised the need for all countries 'to address data \nneeds by applying the principles of Shared Environment \nInformation Systems (SEIS) in line with the commitments \nin the EcAp Decisions of the Barcelona Convention, also \ncontributing to its regional integrated monitoring'. \n\nMultiple content-process iterations were required to \nensure full stakeholder engagement in data collection \nand sharing. Support on the technical aspects related \nto the thematic areas and on developing the relevant \ndata infrastructure was provided through dedicated \ntechnical assistance (TA) missions and continuous \ninteractions with the countries. Guidance was provided \nto help countries to develop their national factsheets \naimed at measuring and documenting progress in \nthe three thematic areas, as a way to build national \ncapacities on the state-of-environment reporting. \n\n1.4.1 Scope, scale and boundaries\n\nAcknowledging the outcomes of the mid-term review \nof the H2020 initiative (EC, 2014), and the work \nprogramme for its second phase (2015-2020) (EC, 2015), \nthe geographical scope of the indicator-based appraisal \nhas been enlarged to cover the whole Mediterranean \narea. For analytical purposes, the region is subdivided \ninto three subregions: (1) Southern Mediterranean \ncountries (6) (MED South); (2) Mediterranean countries \nwhich are EU Member States\u00a0(7) (MED EU); and (3) \nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and \nTurkey (MED Balkans and Turkey), reflecting the \norganisation of cooperation in the region. Note that \nthe aggregated illustration at the subregional level \n(graphs, charts, etc.) may sometimes be impacted by \nthe performance of an individual country. This is due \nto the heterogenous status of the countries clustered \nin these subregions based on comparatively different \nsocio-economic parameters, such as size, economy and \ndemographic performances, etc.\n\nIn the context of H2020, 'pollution' refers primarily \nto the land-based sources of pollution related to \nmunicipal waste, wastewater and industrial emissions. \nHowever, in line with the broadened scope of the \nH2020 work programme in the second phase, this \nsecond assessment also considers emerging issues, \nsuch as hazardous waste and marine litter, as well as \nefforts towards pollution prevention. By looking at \ncross-thematic interactions, the assessment provides \na more holistic and realistic picture of an integrated \napproach to the management of pollution.  \n\n(6)  Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria* and Tunisia.  \n*Cooperation with Syria is currently suspended.

However, data is often only available on the \nnational scale and there can be limited consensus \non the definition of the hydrological basin. Despite \nefforts to focus on the coastal region draining into the \nMediterranean Sea, data collection on a subnational \nscale proved to be challenging. Exceptions to this \nincluded data related to industrial emissions, which \nmainly cover the coastal administrative regions, \nand data delivered by Morocco for the two coastal \nadministrative regions (Tanger-T\u00e9touan-Al Hoceima \nand l'Oriental) and by Bosnia and Herzegovina for the \nAdriatic Sea coastal hydrological basin. The rest of the \ndata are mainly available at the national level. \n\nAt its core, the assessment is based on the production \nand reporting of the H2020 indicators. The set of \nindicators was revised and extended in the second \nphase and now includes a total of 17 covering the three \nthematic areas (Figure 1.1). The revised H2020 indicator \nset is the result of an extensive participatory process \nwhich kicked off with the first Indicators Workshop held \nin Copenhagen in May 2017. Following subsequent \nconsultations with countries, the final list of indicators \nand their methodological specifications was agreed \nduring the second Indicators Workshop held in Athens \nin\u00a0April 2018. A mapping exercise of the H2020 indicators \nagainst the different policies and their reporting \nrequirements was performed, detailing how the selected \nindicators are related to other regional (e.g. IMAP, MSSD) \nand global (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 SDGs) \nprocesses (Annex A). Ensuring the alignment of H2020 \nindicators with other ongoing processes was paramount, \nnot only to support an integrated assessment but also \nto reduce the countries' reporting burden and optimise \nthe use of data for different purposes. The H2020 \nindicators are among those selected to monitor the \nimplementation of the NAPs and are thus referred to \nas\u00a0H2020/NAP indicators.\n\nSubstantial efforts have been made to set up the \nH2020 reporting process from both the national \nand regional side. However, the regional H2020 \ndatabase is still being compiled. For this reason, the \ndata and information base for the assessment was \nsupplemented by publicly available data collected\u00a0from \nopen databases (e.g. World Bank, UNSTATS/SDG, \nEurostat, ESCWA, etc.) and recent national, regional \nand global assessments, expert judgement and \ndocumentation of examples and other evidence of \nprogress such as case studies, based to some extent \non information/data produced by non-governmental \norganisations (NGOs) and academia. Where possible, \n\ndata reported by MED EU countries under relevant EU \nDirectives was analysed to achieve full geographical \ncoverage.\n\n1.4.2 Complementarities with UNEP/MAP assessment \nstudies \n\nThe second H2020 assessment complements other \nMediterranean assessments, notably the 2017 \nMediterranean Quality Status Report (UNEP/MAP, 2017; \nand forthcoming 2023) and the State of Environment \nand Development (SoED 2020) in the Mediterranean \nreport (UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020). Other \nassessments, such as the State of the Environment \nReport 2020 (EEA, 2019e) and the Global Environment \nOutlook (GEO) \u2014 regional assessment for West Asia \n(UNEP, 2016) are also referenced.\n\nThe 2017 Mediterranean Quality Status Report \n(UNEP/MAP, 2017) provided an in-depth assessment \nof\u00a0the\u00a0status of the Mediterranean ecosystem based \non implementation of EcAp. Building on the structure, \nobjectives and data collected under IMAP, progress \ntowards achieving GES was evaluated. The further \ndevelopment of IMAP will form the main information \nand knowledge base for the forthcoming 2023 MED QSR.\n\nThe report on the State of the Environment and \nDevelopment in the Mediterranean (UNEP/MAP-Plan \nBleu, 2020) provides a comprehensive and\u00a0updated \nassessment of the interactions between\u00a0environment \nand development, the main driving forces \n(e.g. socio-economic) and their impacts on the \nMediterranean through an integrated and systemic \napproach. It serves as an up-to-date basis for improved \ndecision-making at all levels, while enhancing the \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda 2030 Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs; (UN, 2015a) and the MSSD).\n\nThe Mediterranean Sustainability Dashboard, \ndeveloped by Plan Bleu in relation to the SDGs and the \nMSSD, provides regular information and factsheets on \ncritical sustainable development indicators. A strategic \nforesight to 2050, MED 2050, to be developed by 2021, \nwill explore scenarios and transition pathways towards \na sustainable and inclusive future in the Mediterranean, \nusing expert knowledge and participatory methods. \n\nThe first Mediterranean Assessment Report on \nthe current state of play and risks of climate and \nenvironmental change in the Mediterranean, to be \npublished in 2020, gathers scientific knowledge through \nthe network of Mediterranean Experts on Climate and \nEnvironmental Change (MedECC, www.medecc.org) \nfrom voluntary scientists across the basin. \n\f\nSection A: The H2020 Assessment Framework\n\n17Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n1.4.3 Structure of the H2020 Mediterranean \nindicator\u2011based technical report\n\nThis report is structured into four key sections \n(Figure\u00a01.3):\n\n\u2022 Section A introduces the H2020 assessment \nframework and the policy boundaries within which \nthis assessment is embedded.\n\n\u2022 Section B describes the regional drivers of change \n\u2014\u00a0both in terms of changes in socio-economic \ndrivers but also the responses put in place. It \nprovides the factual input required to contextualise \nprogress in the three thematic areas. \n\n\u2022 Section C is subdivided into three parallel \nsubsections, dealing with the three thematic \nareas: (1) waste and marine litter; (2) water; and (3) \nindustrial emissions.

These changes reflect the dynamics and \ninteraction of several socio-economic factors as well as \nthe type, extent and effectiveness of societal responses. \nThis section analyses those driving forces that most \ndirectly affect and pose particular challenges to the \nthree areas of pollution, as these must be assessed \nwithin a broader context that goes well beyond their \nsectorial boundaries.\n\n2.1 Key trends in socio-economic drivers\n\nAs covered extensively in the State of the Environment \nand Development report (UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020), \nthe nature of the key drivers of change affecting the \nMediterranean basin has not changed significantly in the \n\n2 Section B: What drives change?\n\nlast few decades. In fact, they persist over time, often in \nan intensified or even accelerated way which, alongside \ntheir cumulative effect, currently drives change and \nmakes the region very heterogeneous. Moreover, the \nspatial distribution of human processes is of particular \nrelevance to the Mediterranean Sea is often the final \nrecipient of discharges of wastewater, industrial \ncontaminants and possibly mismanaged waste, given \nthe proximity of coastal urban areas and industries or \nthrough riverine inputs from more inland communities.\n\n2.1.1 Persistent drivers\n\nOne of the main persistent drivers in the Mediterranean \nis the increasing trend in its demography, the population \nhaving surpassed half a billion people in 2014 (Figure\u00a02.1) \nand currently standing at 528 million (data\u00a0for 2019; \n\nSource:  UN DESA, 2019.\n\nFigure 2.1  Total population in the Mediterranean countries between 1990-2019\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\nPopulation (million)\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey Total MED\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n19Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI.

However, Mediterranean subregions \npresent different demographic dynamics: the MED EU \ncountries have seen their populations stabilise since the \n1980s, whereas the eastern (MED\u00a0Balkans and Turkey) \nand southern populations (MED South) have more than \ndoubled, from roughly 162 million people in 1980 to \n336 million in 2019 (UN DESA, 2019). This unprecedent \npopulation growth has led to an intensification in \nurbanisation, especially in coastal areas (Map 2.1). In\u00a0fact, \none third of the Mediterranean population lives in \ncoastal administrative regions, which represent less than \n12\u00a0% of the surface area of\u00a0all Mediterranean countries, \nand more than half of\u00a0the population resides within the \ncoastal hydrological basins (UNEP/MAP, 2017a). Overall, \nonly 30\u00a0% of the\u00a0Mediterranean population live in rural \n\nareas, and in MED South countries the urban population \nhas increased significantly over the last two decades \n(Figure\u00a02.2), particularly in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. \n\n2.1.2 Intensified pressures\n\nThe intensification of urbanisation in coastal areas \nis further exacerbated by the growing number of \ntourists visiting the Mediterranean (Figure 2.3), which \nremains the largest global tourism destination to \ndate (UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020). In 2018 alone, \nover 390 million international tourists visited the \nMediterranean countries, especially the MED EU and \nMED Balkans and Turkey (88\u00a0% of visits, according \n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n20 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nSource:  UN DESA, 2018.\n\nFigure 2.2  Evolution of total urban and rural populations in MED South between 2000 and 2019\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n52\n\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\n56\n\n57\n\n58\n\nPercentage\n\n0\n\n250\n59\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nRural population % urban population\n\n2000 2019\n\nMillions\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n\nUrban population\n\n60\n\nSource: World Bank, 2020.\n\nFigure 2.3  International tourist arrivals in Mediterranean countries between 2000 and 2018\n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\n0\n\n350\n\nTourist arrivals (million)\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n21Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nto the World Bank (8). Although less than in the MED \nEU countries, tourism is\u00a0also an important source of \nrevenue in the MED South countries and an important \ndriver for socio-economic development. Political \ninstability around the basin and the unrest resulting, \nfor example, from the Arab Spring, lead to a contraction \nin international tourism and receipts, amplifying its \nnegative impacts on economic growth (Diwan et al., \n2017; Plan Blue, 2017).\n\nOn the other hand, tourism is also recognised as \nresource-intensive, demanding high energy and \nwater\u00a0resources. The high spatial and temporal \nvariations of tourism, which is predominantly \nconcentrated along the coastal strip and peaks \nduring\u00a0the summer season, boosts the amount \nof potentially mismanaged waste, as well as in \ndischarges\u00a0of inadequately treated urban wastewater \n(Chaabane et al., 2019). Resulting environmental \ndegradation, such as poor bathing water quality or \nlittered beaches may, in turn, have consequences for \ntourism development, reducing the appeal of tourist \ncoastal destinations and negatively impacting the \neconomy. \n\n2.1.3 Accelerating pressures\n\nIn particular over the last decade, Mediterranean \nsocieties have undergone social, political and economic \ntransformations, to varying degrees, resulting from \nserious conflicts or driven by ambitions of reform. \nAcute transitions, as in the Arab Spring in Tunisia and \nlater in Egypt, or more gradual political opening up, as \nseen in Morocco and Jordan, have led to transitions in \ngovernment and constitutions (Diwan et al., 2017).\n\nWith urbanisation and political shifts in Mediterranean \ndeveloping nations, improvements in the quality of \nliving are rooted in economic models shared by more \ndeveloped countries, which are still largely based \non linear extraction of finite resources rather than \nsystemic circular models of reuse and recycling, where \nwaste products are a resource. As a result, the region \nis facing an overall acceleration of linear production \nand consumption patterns and the take-make-waste \nparadigm. On the other hand, a significant gap \npersists between MED EU and MED South and MED \nBalkans and Turkey countries in terms of economical \nperformances (Figure 2.4) with the three subregions \n\nNote:  Data for Syria only available for the period 2000-2007.\n\nSource:  World Bank, 2020. \n\nFigure 2.4  Gross domestic product in Mediterranean subregions for the period 2000-2018 (current USD)\n\n1 000\n\n2 000\n\n3 000\n\n4 000\n\n5 000\n\n6 000\n\n7 000\n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\n0\n\n8 000\n\nBillion current USD\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey\n\n(8) World Bank Development Indicators.\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n22 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nbeing affected differently by global and local changes. \nMED EU countries are gradually recovering from the \n2008 global and subsequent euro sovereign debt crisis. \nMED Balkans and Turkey were only partially affected \nby repercussions from weakened neighbouring \nEU countries, while MED South countries have \nbeen particularly resilient to the 2008 global crisis \nalthough their economies deteriorated as the result \nof\u00a0geopolitical turmoil (UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020).\n\nAnother transition relates to the overall decrease \nin the agriculture and industrial sectors' share of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in favour of services. \nNevertheless, industrial installations continue to \ncontribute significantly to national economies, despite \nvarying widely among countries (between approximately \n12 and 39\u00a0% for Cyprus and Algeria, respectively \u2014 data \nfor 2018; World Bank, 2020). However, the overall shift \nin industries does not necessarily result in less resources \nbeing consumed or less pollution, as discussed in the \nSoED (UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020) and as evidence \ngathered in this report indicates (see Section C \n\u2014\u00a0Industrial emissions). \n\nAs the region continues to be dominated by tension \nand geopolitical conflicts, some countries are facing \nthe disruption of institutions or even collapsing \ninfrastructures and industries, as well as the \ndisplacement of populations, both within and across \n\nborders. In such an unstable and critical situation, \npollution prevention and environmental policies no \nlonger take priority on national agendas and budgets.\n\nThe conflicts are not always localised, and their \nnegative impacts have spilled over to other countries \nin the region, including European Member States. \nAs illustrated in Figure 2.5, the number of refugees \nreceived by Mediterranean countries has escalated in \nrecent years following regional conflicts, in particular \nin Syria. MED South countries, mainly Lebanon and \nJordan, received over 2 million refugees in 2018. Turkey \nalone took in 3.6 million refugees in 2018, more than \nhalf of the total hosted by the entire Mediterranean \nregion and number one in the world for receiving the \nhighest number of refugees. Access to water, food and \nsanitary services, as well as waste management, are of \nspecific concern in the management of refugee camps.\n\n2.1.4 Exacerbating pressures\n\nDisplacement of people can also be driven by climate \nand environmental shifts. The effects of climate \nchange are accelerating in the Mediterranean and \nexacerbating the impact of other drivers, such \nas demand for resources resulting from growing \npopulations and industries, in the context of linear \neconomies. The region seems to be warming 20\u00a0% \n\nNote:  Data for Palestine not available and for Montenegro only for the period 2006-2018.\n\nSource:  UNHCR, 2020. \n\nFigure 2.5  Number of refugees (including refugee-like situations) hosted in Mediterranean sub-regions \nbetween 2000 and 2018 \n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n7\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 20182000\n\nMillions\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n\n5\n\n6\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n23Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nfaster than the global average, showing an increase \nin the average temperature of 1.5 \u00b0C (Figure 2.6), \nwhile, in the last few years, droughts have increased in \nfrequency and intensity (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2014).\n\nWater scarcity due to climate change and greater \ndemand for water from increasing demographics \nis expected to lead to an increase from 180 million \nto 250\u00a0million people in the Mediterranean being \nclassified as 'water-poor' (i.e. those having access \nto less than 100\u00a0m3 per capita per year) in the next \n20\u00a0years (MedECC, 2019). The consequences of other \ncumulative and disruptive impacts of climate change \non already fragile but interdependent societies and \neconomies may prove difficult to predict. \n\n2.2 Responses as drivers of change\n\nBesides the typical external drivers (changes in \ndemography, economy, climate change, etc.), responses \nin the form of policies, investments, awareness raising \nand capacity building are also factors conducive to \nchange. In general, Responses refers to measures taken \nby societies to remove, minimise or accommodate \nchanges in the system. In this specific context, \n\nResponses refers to the type of actions that address \npollution pressures, ranging from tools for data and \ninformation management, investments in infrastructure \nprojects, developing capacities to respond to existing \nand new challenges, introducing new policies and \nlegislations and integrating existing ones. In discussing \nthe key responses, specific examples are provided \nmainly from MED South countries, on account of the \ndedicated cooperation with this subregion and the \ndialogue established through the H2020 RM group.\n\n2.2.1 Development of new tools and platforms for \ndata\u00a0and information management \n\nAt the regional level, it was necessary to develop new \ntools and platforms to facilitate data and information \nmanagement. A key milestone has been achieved \nover the last two years with the development of the \nInfoMAP platform by the UNEP/MAP Information and \nCommunication Regional Activity Centre Info/RAC. \nThe\u00a0InfoMAP platform is the Mediterranean\u00a0knowledge \nplatform created to provide and share data, \ninformation services and knowledge for the benefit \nof the Mediterranean Action Plan components and \nContracting Parties. It represents a unique access point \n\nNotes:  Warming of the atmosphere in the Mediterranean Basin (annual mean temperature anomalies with the period 1880-1899) (blue lines, \nwith and without smoothing) and for the globe (green line). \n\nSources:  Taken from MedECC, 2019; original source: Cramer et al., 2018.\n\nFigure 2.6  Warming of the atmosphere in the Mediterranean Basin\n\nMean temperature anomalies (K)\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020\n\nMediterranean Basin Mediterranean Basin without smoothing Globe Globe without smoothing\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n24 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nfor all the Barcelona Convention mandatory reporting, \nincluding industrial emissions, the IMAP pilot platform \nas well as H2020. It comes with multiple functionalities: \nharmonising data structure and models, creating a \ncommon catalogue of resources, integrating data with \ninteroperability layers, creating a common platform \nto view, query and analyse data, and producing tools \nto support the dissemination of data and information. \nSupplementary information on the structure and \nfunctioning of the InfoMAP regional infrastructure can \nbe found in Annex F.\n\nThis platform was used to support the H2020 reporting \nand assessment process, guided by two approaches: \nthe Monitoring \u2014 Data \u2014 Indicators \u2014 Assessment \n\u2014 Knowledge (MDIAK) chain (Figure 2.7) and the SEIS \nframework. The MDIAK reporting chain, developed \nby the EEA, conceptualises the underlying provision \nof data and its processing, and the production of \nindicators that underpin assessments. The SEIS \nconceptual framework, which is based on three \npillars \u2014 content, infrastructure and governance \u2014 \nsupports the design and implementation of a regular \nreporting process and indicator-based environmental \nassessments. Both approaches were necessary \nto establish the governance structure, networks, \ncoordination and synergies required for setting up \na regional reporting and assessment process. This \nprocess was at the heart of the ENI SEIS II South project \nwith the overall aim of developing an SEIS in support of \nthe regular production and sharing of quality-assessed \nenvironmental data and indicators. \n\nAlthough the technology is in place, the challenge of \nsustaining the system while maintaining a flexible \nenvironment for adapting to changing policy relevance \nremains. The value of sharing and reporting data is still \nnot fully recognised and needs to be strengthened. \n\nThe preparation of a UNEP/MAP Data Management \nPolicy (Decision IG.24/2; UNEP/MAP, 2019) will ensure \nthat data are managed transparently and are properly \ndisseminated and recognised, following similar \nprinciples and rules across countries and stakeholders.\n\nAt the national level, significant efforts were made \nto further develop information systems based on \nSEIS principles. More specifically, Israel and Jordan \ndeveloped web-based platforms dedicated to a \nreal-time information system for waste, while Israel, \nJordan and Palestine established water information \nsystems. Morocco set up an environmental information \nsystem and Tunisia designed a dedicated information \nsystem for hazardous waste alongside a process to \nmonitor health and environment indicators. However, \nin general, legally binding reporting obligations (law, \nby-law/legally binding Instruction) with clear guidance \non the data and information to be reported are lacking.\n\nIn the second phase of H2020, the national \ninterinstitutional cooperation, coordination and \ngovernance set-up were strengthened by formalising \nthe engagements and liaison with stakeholders and \nentities, such as SDG national committees, MED POL \nFocal Points, ministries of interior, industry, water and \nirrigation, health and local authorities, as called for in \nthe UfM Athens Ministerial Declaration (EU, 2014b) and \nspecified in the H2020 work programme 2015-2020 \n(EC, 2015). In a process driven mainly by the designated \nauthorities representing environmental and statistical \norganisations, efforts were made to increase ownership \nof both the process and the outcomes. These \nnational committees acted as coordination platforms \nenhancing synergies between H2020 issues and other \nprocesses, for example, SDGs. Some countries, such \nas Jordan, Palestine and Tunisia, took advantage of the \nmomentum created by the ENI SEIS I and II projects \nto establish national inter-institutional committees \nand national working groups that also bring together \nrepresentatives of several relevant authorities. In some \ncases, these agreements have been formalised through \nMemoranda of Understanding on data exchange, such \nas in Palestine (see Box 2.1), compared to early 2011, \nwhen interinstitutional cooperation was typically based \non ad-hoc requests or gentlemen's agreements. \n\nThis enhanced interinstitutional cooperation is a \nmajor achievement since the mid-term review of \nthe initiative in 2014 (EC, 2014). However, despite \nmore interinstitutional dialogue, in some cases, the \ncooperation among governmental institutions remains \nvery limited resulting in a lack of cohesiveness and \nhampering the efforts for greater policy integration. \nAn overview of the progress in activities related to \ndata, indicators and information systems in MED South \ncountries for each thematic area is provided in Table\u00a02.1.\n\nSource:  https://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/communication/\nnews/further-development-towards-a-renewed-set-ofhorizon-2020-indicators\n\nFigure 2.7  Schematic illustration of the MDIAK \nchain\n\nM D I A K\n\nM D I A K\nMONITORING DATA INFORMATION ASSESSMENTS\n\nCollect Structure Interpret\nIntegrate\n\nReflect\n\nKNOWLEDGE\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n25Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n2.2.2 Direct actions\n\nIn addition to effective governance and environmental \npolicies, different sources of funding and investment \nare necessary to improve the situation through direct \nactions 'on the ground'. Although resources have \nbeen mobilised to prevent, reduce and remediate \npollution, no aggregated data is available to produce \na clear overview of the investments made in the \nlast few years. The list of investment depollution \nprojects compiled by the UfM in 2014 in the so-called \ninvestment portfolio, provided information on the \nlocation, characteristics of size/reduction of pollutants \nloads, status of implementation, cost or investment \nneeded. This inventory has not been updated since. In \nthe absence of such information, insights into the types \nof investments and measures planned by countries \nto target these types of pollution were retrieved from \ntheir updated NAPs and are presented below.\n\nThe range of measures put forward by countries in \nthe updated NAPs which directly target the three \ntypes of pollution follow the prevention hierarchy, \nin\u00a0which prevention at source prevails over reduction \nof pressures and remediation interventions. This is \nparticularly valid for measures related to solid waste \nand urban wastewater, while for industrial emissions \nthe focus is predominantly on end-of-the-pipe \ninvestments \u2014 reduction of pressure (Figure 2.8).\n\nThe investment component of the H2020 initiative was \nimplemented through the Mediterranean Hot Spot \nInvestment Programme (MeHSIP I and II projects) led \nby the European Investment Bank (EIB). Despite this \nprogramme's achievements (see Box 2.2), beneficiary \ncountries highlighted a number of shortcomings in \nterms of investment capacities. Investment projects \nare inherently challenging: they take time to realise \nand face many obstacles along the way. Although \nsubject to continuity as a precondition, in reality, \n\npriorities change and adaptations are constantly \nrequired. High-level political support is also necessary \nfor investments to advance. Access to available \nfunds is a particular limitation, together with the \nlack of investment capacities, including capacities to \nidentify bankable projects, preparedness for project \npreparation and implementation, and support \nto conclude loan agreements with international \nfinancial institutions. In\u00a0addition to support from such \ninstitutions for projects addressing pollution, some \ncountries have dedicated funds to tackle different \nsources of pollution, for example, to fund the closing \nand rehabilitation of dump sites and the construction \nof new waste-treatment plants in Algeria and Morocco. \nHowever, data on the resources contributed by \ngovernments for such projects is not available. \n\nAccess to funding for green entrepreneurs in the MED \nSouth subregion also has its challenges and limitations \n(UfM and SCP/RAC, 2018). These activities promote the \nprinciples of sustainable consumption and production \n\u2014 taking profit into account alongside social and \nenvironmental sustainability, they have the potential \nto bring about change in societies. Yet, evidence shows \nthat innovative ideas from green start-ups are not \nreadily funded. Financing working capital, purchasing \nthe necessary equipment, etc. are among the main \nissues facing green entrepreneurs, as a result of gaps \nin the supply of finance and the misalignment between \ntheir needs and just what the financial system is willing \nto provide for them (UfM and SCP/RAC, 2018). \n\nThe application of economic instruments, such \nas the polluter-pays principle, extended producer \nresponsibility (EPR), is also conducive to changes \nin\u00a0practice or behaviour. Although a comprehensive \noverview of these economic instruments and their \neffectiveness in supporting the overall H2020 goal is \nnot readily available, specific examples are provided \nbelow to illustrate their application.  \n\nBox 2.1  Synergies with SDG indicators \u2014 the case of Palestine \n\nThe mandate for implementation of SDGs in Palestine was reiterated in the Palestinian cabinet decree, nominating the \nPalestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) to lead efforts to modernise the SDG indicators, in cooperation with all \nstakeholders, for monitoring and evaluation. Hence, as the leading agency in the Palestinian National Statistical System, \nPCBS has worked with national political authorities to identify national SDG priorities and to plan for the collection, \ncompilation, quality control and dissemination of data. In response, in order to achieve the monitoring of SDGs, the \nPalestinian prime minster issued a decree on forming a national team to coordinate the implementation of the action plans \nfor sustainable development. The national team includes all ministries, NGOs and private sectors. The team will work to \nprepare reports for the Advisory Council, comprising representatives from the governmental, non-governmental and private \nsectors as well as academia. In the long term, the national efforts to implement the SDGs will have a positive effect on data \nproduction and availability.\n\nSource: https://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/countries/palestine/key-docs/key-documents/country-visit-summary-report\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n26 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nKey: red \u2014 not acceptable/poor progress \n\n orange \u2014 reasonable progress but not sufficient \n\n green \u2014 satisfactory/good progress\n\n \uf0e6\u00e4 \u2014 deteriorating/improving \n\n '\u2013' not possible to assess \n\nNote:  This classification should be regarded as 'perceived progress' based on the yearly monitoring of progress made by the H2020 RM group \nand expert judgement.

In some countries, \nthe polluter-pays principle is applied as a way of \npromoting more integrated management practices, for \nexample, Lebanon adopted an integrated solid waste \nmanagement law stipulating that the polluters bear \nthe costs of managing the solid waste generated; and \na landfill levy is paid by municipalities in Israel for the \nwaste produced and sent to landfills. In turn, the funds \ncollected are invested in improving waste management, \nincreasing recycling and preventing pollution. \nIn\u00a0Tunisia, apart from receiving penalties for infringing \n\nenvironmental laws, polluters must take action to \nreduce pollution. Environmental tax from industries \n\u2014\u00a0'les \u00e9tablissements classes' \u2014 is collected on a yearly \nbasis by the ministry of finance, part of which goes \ntowards financing the Tunisian environmental agency \n(ANPE). \n\nEPR, which entails making manufacturers responsible \nfor the entire life cycle of products and packaging, \nis also progressively being introduced.

MeHSIP comprised two phases: MeHSIP-I (2009-2013) and MeHSIP-II (2015-2018). Its overall objective was \nto promote adequate and sound management of water, wastewater, solid waste and industrial emissions in the Southern \nMediterranean region in order to reduce health risks and improve the quality of life, as well as contributing to achieving \nthe H2020 goals. Its specific objectives were to increase the number of viable projects in priority sectors capable of being \nreadily financed by donors and implemented by promoters, to ensure their efficient and sustainable operation in the long \nterm, and to strengthen the project preparation capacity of public-sector institutions and the private sector. The thematic \nand geographical scope of MeHSIP-II was extended to include: (1) water resources management, water supply; (2) climate \naction (adaptation and mitigation); and (3) support for sustainable growth and job creation; and also to reduce pollution in \nareas that do not drain into the Mediterranean. MeHSIP-II achieved these objectives by providing TA for the preparation of \ninvestment projects in the above-mentioned relevant sectors. This assistance was based on two stages: the first consisted \nof building a project pipeline in each of the target areas, while the second phase covered project preparation starting from \nproject screening up to the early stages of implementation. The H2020 pipeline was anchored in the NAPs for depollution \nof\u00a0the Mediterranean under the LBS Protocol of the Barcelona Convention.\n\nAs of May 2020, MeHSIP-II mobilised a total of EUR 3.7 million in TA funds from the Climate Action in the Middle East and \nNorth Africa (CAMENA) envelope, EUR 0.7 million from the Public-Private Partnership Project Preparation in the Southern \nand Eastern Mediterranean (MED 5P) facility, and EUR 0.1 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). MeHSIP experts \nalso provided technical support to several other projects.\n\nProjects with a total investment exceeding EUR 1.4 billion have been prepared with the support of MeHSIP-II and approved \nfor co-financing by the EIB (note that the EIB is only funding a part of the investment). Overall, projects supported by the \nprogramme have a total potential investment volume of EUR 2.8 billion. In total, MeHSIP-II has helped in the preparation \nof\u00a024 projects (see below).\n\nCountry Project Sector TA budget \n(EUR million)\n\nTA funding \nsource\n\nEstimated  \ninvestment  \n\n(EUR million)\n\nStatus\n\n1 Egypt Alexandria West wastewater \ntreatment plants (WWTPs) \nupgrade and extension\n\nWW 0.4 CAMENA 185 Approved by \nEIB Board\n\n2 Egypt Depollution of Bahr al-Baqar \nagricultural drain\n\nMS 0.2 SSF Cairo 550 TA completed\n\nNo further \ninterest in the \nproject from \nthe Egyptian \nauthorities\n\n3 Egypt Rehabilitation and extension \nfor several water and WWTPs \nin different governorates\n\nMS 0.2 SSF Cairo 250 TA completed\n\nInterest in \nthe project \n\nwithdrawn by \nthe Egyptian \nauthorities\n\n4 Egypt Kitchener drain investment \nproject\n\nMS 0.2 SSF Cairo 441 Approved by \nEIB Board\n\n5 Egypt Fayoum WW expansion \nproject\n\nWW 0.8 EBRD IPPF 395 Approved by \nEIB Board\n\n6 Jordan Deir Alla and Al-Karameh \nwater supply and sanitation \nproject\n\nMS 0.5 CAMENA 97 Approved by \nEIB Board\n\n7 Jordan Bani Kenanah water supply \nand sanitation project\n\nMS 0.5 CAMENA 40 TA completed\n\nWater supply \ncomponent \n\nonly to be taken \nforward\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n29Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nBox 2.2  Investments in pollution reduction and prevention \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMeHSIP-II worked in partnership with the SWIM-H2020 Support Mechanism project (2016-2019) and the UfM Secretariat \nto promote and facilitate sustainable investments in the water and sanitation services.

The main objectives are to reduce \nlittering, reduce landfill mass, and encourage recycling \nand reuse of beverage containers. Other relevant \nlegislation includes the packaging law, electrical and \nelectric equipment and batteries law, tyre disposal \nand the recycling law.\n\nIn addition to investments and economic instruments, \ncapacity development plays a key role in acquiring \nthe necessary technical skills, adopting best practices \nand updating existing policies or introducing new \nlegislation to abate pollution. In recent years, capacities \nhave been enhanced by regional cooperation actions, \nincluding SWIM-H2020 SM (see Box 2.3), TA under \nthe ENI SEIS II South support mechanism on aspects \nrelated to monitoring, data and indicators, and TA \nunder MeHSIP (see Box 2.2). Further support through \ndifferent instruments (e.g. Twinning, TAIEX and TA) has \nproved essential for sustaining institutional capacities \nin MED South countries and ensuring up-to-date \nknowledge exchange on, for instance, integrated \npollution prevention and control, waste management \nand integrated water resources management. Due to \na higher demand for data, statistics and knowledge \ndriven by the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, \nefforts to enhance the statistical capacities of national \nstatistical offices have been stepped up in response \nto SDG 17.18 (9): Enhance capacity-building support \nto developing countries, including for least developed \ncountries and small island developing States, to increase \nsignificantly the availability of high-quality, timely and \nreliable data in all countries by 2020.\n\nThese capacity development activities did not only \nserve to enhance technical skills and competences, \nimprove own practices and share best practices, but \nhave been instrumental in establishing an extended \nregional network of professionals from across various \ninstitutions, disciplines and scientific areas. This \nnetwork activates the cooperation and supports the \nsynergies required for the adoption and extension \nof the notion of integration in policymaking and in \nmanaging pollution.  \n\nAlongside developing the capacities of institutions \nand technical staff comes awareness raising among \ncivil society and the public. During the last five years, \nthe region and the world in general have witnessed \ngreater awareness of sustainable development and \nenvironmental issues as a result of the impetus given \n\nby the 2030 Agenda. The SDGs provide the global \nforum for engagement and a common reference \nframework at various levels \u2014 local, national, regional \nand global. The MSSD (2016-2025; UNEP/MAP, 2016b), \na strategic guiding document for all stakeholders and \npartners to translate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment at the regional, subregional and national \nlevels, acts as a leverage for creating awareness \naround the potential of the green economy transition \nand sustainable lifestyles, sustainable tourism, urban \nresilience, climate change, etc. Several civil society \norganisations contributed to the overall H2020 efforts \n(10). Overall, there seems to be more awareness on the \nneed for sustainable development among the public \nand society, while environmental issues are moving up \nthe priority ladder in policy agendas.\n\n2.2.3 Shift towards more integrated policies and \nmanagement approaches\n\nThe holistic concepts and principles of sustainable \ndevelopment and the ecosystem-based approach \nare now firmly embedded in international policies \nand widely referenced in the strategies and plans \nprepared by Mediterranean countries. The debate on \ntransition to systemic approaches, which considers \nthe interlinkages between environmental, economic \nand social components in a holistic way, is beginning \nto resonate in the region. With the introduction of the \necosystem-based approach, the region is aiming to \nmove away from addressing single pressures or sectors \nto multiple uses/sectors/activities and their combined \neffects on marine ecosystems and their services.\n\nSuch a shift is also noticeable at the national level. In \nthe waste sector, recent policies are clearly shifting to \nthe more integrated management of municipal solid \nwaste and are mainly aligned with the EU acquis. Israel \nhas the most-developed legislation in the MED South \nsubregion (e.g. law for reducing the use of plastic bags, \nrecycling and packaging law). Both Jordan and Israel \nhave recently adopted national waste-management \nstrategies based on the 'hierarchy of integrated solid \nwaste-management practices' \u2014 prevention, preparing \nfor reuse, recycling \u2014 with clear targets for reducing \nlandfilling and increasing recycling and energy recovery \n(in the case of Israel). In Jordan, a waste framework \nlaw has recently been adopted (2020) serving as an \numbrella for integrated waste management, covering \nboth municipal solid waste and hazardous waste. Other \ncountries, such as Lebanon and Egypt, are currently \n\n(9) https://sdg-tracker.org/global-partnerships#17.18\n(10)  https://www.h2020.net/component/jdownloads/category/340-10th-horizon-2020-steering-group-meeting-25-september-2019-athens\ngreece?Itemid=411\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n31Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\ndeveloping their national waste strategies. In addition, \ncountries are shifting towards the circular economy, \nbased on sustainable consumption and production \npractices and nature-based solutions (see Box 2.4). \nCountries have developed Sustainable Consumption \nand Production (SCP) Action Plans as part of the \nimplementation of the SCP Regional Action Plan, \ndefining clear actions to move to more sustainable \npractices. \n\nWhen it comes to water, there is a clear move away \nfrom addressing water quality issues per se to \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) which \npromotes coordinated and inclusive approaches for the \n\nBox 2.3  Sustainable Water Integrated Management and Horizon 2020 Support Mechanism (SWIM-H2020 SM)\n\nThe capacity-building component of the H2020 Initiative was realised mainly through the EU-funded SWIM-H2020 Support \nMechanism (2016-2019) which focused on the reduction of industrial emissions, municipal waste and urban wastewater into \nthe Mediterranean Sea and ensuring the sustainable use of water resources. The SM offered a range of tailored and targeted \ninterventions for enhancing skills and competences of authorities and other stakeholders primarily in the MED South \nsubregion. These included a demand-driven expert facility, peer-to-peer experience sharing and dialogue, training activities \nand webinars. These activities contributed not only to enhancing capacities but also to raising education and awareness, \nengaging stakeholders and facilitating communication on sustainable investments. In particular, the SWIM-H2020 \nproject was instrumental in the development and outreach of the Mediterranean Strategy on Education  on Sustainable \nDevelopment (MSESD). It also disseminated innovative approaches tested within EU-funded demonstration projects and \norganised exchanges of good practices between the countries across the region.\n\nA key aim of the project focused on strengthening regional coherence and cooperation in approaches to marine pollution \nprevention and control, and sustainable water management. In this way, it ensured that national needs matched the \nregional activities and challenges while, at the same time, countries were asked to propose national solutions to implement \nregional decisions. Country representatives expressed a high level of satisfaction with these tailor-made activities addressing \nnational needs and priorities. Critical issues such as waste management, e.g. construction and demolition waste; the \nreduction of industrial emissions, such as heavy metals emissions from iron and steel mills*; the green economy; the \nefficient use of water; and education on sustainable development were tackled in a holistic manner. Within the H2020 \nframework, extensive work was carried on detailed calculation of loads of heavy metals from iron and mill industries, and \nthe revision of ELVs in conjunction with BATs and BREFs.\n\nIn total, 1 408 trainees benefited from regional and national trainings provided by no less than 121 international and local \nnon-key experts in interventions and characterised by a strong participatory, interactive and hands-on set-up. This enabled \nthe sharing of best practices among countries, e.g. between northern and southern Mediterranean countries, as well as \nbetween MED South countries with similar problems and experiences. In addition, the project supported the creation of the \nnecessary institutional and operational frameworks and strategies to help the authorities to reach consensus with various \nstakeholders on critical issues.\n\nCountries in the MED South subregion are currently benefitting from capacity-building programmes provided by the Water \nand Environment Support project (WES; 2019-2023), as a follow-up to SWIM-H2020 SM.\n\nProject websites: https://www.swim-h2020.eu/; https://www.wes-med.eu/\n\n* https://www.h2020.net/component/jdownloads/send/291-lectures-presentations/2855-pollution-loads-from-iron-steelindustries-prof-michael-scoullos\n\ndevelopment and management of resources. In the EU, \nIWRM is implemented through the WFD and daughter \ndirectives. Through bilateral EU support, Algeria and \nMorocco have already introduced some of these \nprinciples and concepts and have initial experience \nin developing management plans. This transfer of \nknow-how has provided the Moroccan institutions in \ncharge of planning with the organisational tools and \ntechniques related to IWRM implementation. Another \nexample is the piloted integration of IWRM and \nintegrated coastal management (ICM) that was tested \nas part of the MedProgramme of UNEP/MAP (11) to \nsupport the implementation of policy measures related \nto the sustainable use of resources. Despite having \n\n(11)  https://pap-thecoastcentre.org/pdfs/Plan%20Buna%20Bojana.pdf\n\f\nSection B: what drives change?\n\n32 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\na primary focus on water resources, the pilot also \nconsidered the interface of inland and marine waters \nas well as transboundary basin management.\n\nThe progressive use of pollutant release and transfer \nregister (E-PRTR) systems in the whole region could \nbe an important tool for supporting integrated \nenvironmental management and policies. The recently \nlaunched EU Green Deal (12) also offers promising \ndevelopment across the region. \n\nThe move towards integrated policies and sustainability \ntransitions must be guided by the most up-todate knowledge. In Europe, knowledge of systemic \nchallenges and responses is growing and is increasingly \nreflected in EU policy frameworks (EEA, 2019e). Due \n\nto the complex interaction of cumulative pressures \nand their impacts, this knowledge for action should be \nboth anticipatory and transdisciplinary (EEA,\u00a02019e). \nThe need to invest in a stronger knowledge base \nthat enhances the capacity to react quickly in crisis \nsituations while responding to sustainability for \nmore long-term issues still remains across the whole \nMediterranean region. Despite shifts on the policy \nfront, achieving goals and targets set in the national \nstrategies will not only require reinforcing the \nknowledge base but also more financing and capacity \nbuilding, the engagement of businesses and citizens' \nawareness, and better coordination among all actors \nat the national level. For this reason, when it comes to \nthe implementation on the ground, most approaches \nremain mainly sectorial.\n\nBox 2.4  Nature-based solutions to wastewater management \n\nIn 2018, the assessment by UN Water (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018) sheds light on nature-based solutions (NBS) to water \nmanagement, including wastewater. As the term implies, NBS are inspired and supported by nature by using or mimicking \nnatural processes. In recent years, such solutions have received greater attention and investments worldwide. They support \nconcepts such as the circular and green economy which aims to generate social, economic and environmental co-benefits. \nSeveral NBS are intended for managing water quality, including the management of non-point-source pollution from \nagriculture, through e.g. buffer strips, vegetative waterways, etc., and urban green infrastructure to reduce pollution from \nurban run-off. Other NBS, such as natural and constructed wetlands, are used for wastewater treatment because of their \ncapacity to degrade or immobilise a range of pollutants, including emerging pollutants. Like most treatment systems, they \nfunction by reducing organic matter and pathogens to a minimum. However, their efficiency for nitrogen and phosphorus \nreduction is variable. Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment can be a cost-effective NBS that provides effluent of \nadequate quality for several non-potable uses, including irrigation, as well as offering additional benefits, including energy \nproduction. When it comes to industrial wastewater treatment, the feasibility of NBS depends on the pollutant type and its \nloading. In the case of polluted water sources, grey infrastructure solutions may continue to be needed. \n\nConstructed wetlands have been used in particular in many Mediterranean countries, including Egypt (pilot project in \nBilbeis,\u00a055 km north of Cairo), Lebanon (Litani river basin), Italy (reed beds in central Italy), Syria (Haran Al-Awamied), \nFrance (roughly 3 500 in small communities), Turkey (Balchik and Orucoglu), Croatia, Greece and Israel (Ayaz et al., 2016; \nMorvannou et al., 2015; Masi and Martinuzzi, 2007). Constructed wetlands of the lagoon type are commonly used in several \nMediterranean cities in Morocco, including Berkane, Sa\u00efdia, Ben Ta\u00efeb, Midar, Al Aaroui, Kariat Arekmane and Ras El Ma \n(H2020 National Report for Morocco, 2020). Constructed wetlands are an efficient wastewater treatment method in terms \nof the removal of organic content in secondary treatment plants. Specifically, the Mediterranean climate makes the process \nmore efficient because of the warmer temperatures, compared to Northern Europe (Masi and Martinuzzi, 2007), making it \nan interesting way of treating wastewater in the region.\n\n(12)  https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-european-green-deal_en\n\f\n33\n\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\nTechnical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n3.1 Municipal waste and marine litter \n\n3.1.1 Municipal waste and marine litter assessment \n\u2014\u00a0key messages \n\n\u2022 Coastal population and tourism, associated with \ntake-make-waste economic models, are the \nmain drivers of plastic waste generation and \nmarine litter in the Mediterranean. Marine litter \nin the Mediterranean originates predominantly \nfrom land-based sources but the lack of data means \ntrends cannot be defined. Nevertheless, there is \nevidence that efforts to adequately prevent, collect \nand process such waste are far from sufficient to \nreduce leakages into the sea.\n\n\u2022 Municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has \nbeen increasing across the whole region since \n2014 and is expected to continue to do so in the \ncoming decade. Although MSW generation is higher \nin more-developed countries, such as the MED EU \ncountries and Israel, other nations are following \nsimilar trends, with no evidence of decoupling \nbetween economic growth and population increase. \nIn the MED South alone, projections expect the \ntrend to continue to rise (+29\u00a0% in 2030 and +50\u00a0% \n\n3 Section C: Thematic Assessment\n\nin 2050), although with significant differences \nbetween rural and urban areas.\n\n\u2022 The composition of MSW across the Mediterranean \ncontinues to be dominated by organic waste, \nespecially in the MED South countries, with relatively \nmore glass, paper and plastic in other subregions. \nPlastic fraction is expected to increase in the \nfuture, largely driven by consumption changes and \nlifestyles, although it currently varies widely within \nthe region (between 3\u00a0% and 23\u00a0% of MSW). Since \n2007, there has been an overall increase in plastic \npackaging generation in the MED EU countries, \nalthough not in terms of generation per capita.\n\n\u2022 Despite important improvements, the collection \nof MSW is still a significant issue in most MED \nSouth countries, where only a few countries \nare succeeding in reaching full waste collection \ncoverage, which remains particularly difficult in \nrural areas, where waste is usually illegally dumped \nor burned. The picture is particularly negative in \nsuburbs and slums, where a sizeable share of the \npopulation lives and where waste-collection services \nare either limited or non-existent. The role of \nthe informal sector is particularly important for \nwaste collection in some MED South countries, and \n\nWaste MED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey\n\nYears Outlook Years Outlook Years Outlook\n\n2003 2014 2020 2030 2003 2014 2020 2030 2003 2014 2020 2030\n\nWaste generation \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \uf0e6\n\nPlastic waste generation per capita \uf0e6 \uf0e6 \u00e4 \uf0e6 \uf0e6 ? \u00e4 \uf0e6 \u00e4\n\nWaste collection coverage \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 ? ? \u00e4\n\nWasted collected by formal system \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 ? ? \u00e4\n\nWaste treatment \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4\n\nWaste that goes to uncontrolled dumpsites ? ? \u00e4 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nPlastic waste recycling \u00e4 \u00e4 \u00e4 ? ? \u00e4 ? ? \u00e4\n\nNote:  MED South rating is attributed according to the situation in most countries in the subregion.\n\nTable 3.1  Overview of progress on the H2020 waste indicators per subregion\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n34 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\ntheir inclusion in waste management represents a \nsignificant opportunity to improve the coverage and \nthe efficiency of waste collection, with positive social \nand economic impacts.\n\n\u2022 In the period 2014-2017, the disposal of waste in \nlandfills and sanitary landfills declined in MED EU \ncountries, remained stable in MED Balkans and \nTurkey, and increased in MED South countries. In \nthe latter countries, waste is normally discharged \ninto open dumps, creating considerable negative \nimpacts on the environment and human health. In \nthese countries, there have been improvements in \ncapacity and infrastructure and such efforts should \nbe further encouraged and expanded to meet the \nexpected increase in waste generation in the future.\n\n\u2022 Overall, recycling is increasing in the \nMediterranean region at different rates, which \nare higher in the MED EU countries. The average \nrecycling rate in the MED EU countries is still lower \nthan the EU average and formal recycling remains \nvery limited in most MED South countries. In this \nsubregion, data coverage and reliability are limited \nand should be improved; they are also due to \nthe role of the informal sector in the collection of \nrecyclables. As shown by successful experiences \nat the national level, there is an opportunity \nto improve waste management in MED South \ncountries by exploiting the high share of organic \nwaste, putting in place composting treatment \nplants that could have positive impacts on the \nenvironment (in terms of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions) and on the economy, creating jobs, and \npromoting a circular economy approach.\n\n\u2022 The Mediterranean countries are active parts of \nmajor international conventions on the regulation \nof waste and marine litter. Accordingly, waste \nmanagement legislation has been in place for \nseveral decades in the MED EU countries, while \nthe recent EU Circular Economy Action Plan \nrequires significant progress towards better waste \nmanagement. Most countries in the MED South \nand MED Balkans and Turkey have waste policies, \nplans or strategies for waste management at \nboth the national and subnational level. However, \nwaste-management systems in these countries \nare constrained by a weak legal framework and a \nlow level of enforcement, poor public awareness \nand citizens' improper waste-disposal behaviour, \npolitical instability and conflicts, and budgets. \nThe capacities of the public authorities in MED \nSouth countries must be enhanced, in particular \ntheir capacity to monitor and enforce the \nimplementation of waste legislation and to \ncombat littering and illegal dumping activities.\n\n\u2022 The production of reliable data and regular \nmonitoring of waste streams is still necessary \nto support informed decision-making, in the MED \nEU countries, too. As in 2014, waste data collection \nin MED South counties is limited and the picture \nhas not improved, mainly due to low investment \nand human resources in data production. This is \nalso true for marine litter, where data are limited, \ninconsistent and fragmented. In this respect, it \nis necessary to ensure continuous support to \nMediterranean-scale and national monitoring \nprogrammes, which have been designed and are in \noperation, to ensure a consistent dataflow and the \ngeneration of high-quality datasets. Moreover, it is \nfundamental to support capacity-building efforts \nand coordination among national institutions, to \nimprove data harmonisation at the Mediterranean \nscale, to facilitate the creation of a comprehensive \nMediterranean-level database and to support \neffective cross-border decision-making.\n\n3.1.2 Why is waste a priority issue in the \nMediterranean?\n\nWaste generation and management entails a \nconsiderable loss of material and energy resources and \nmay pose serious risks for the environment and human \nhealth. These include, for example,  contamination of \nsoil, groundwater, and surface waters from leachate; \nair pollution associated with open burning of waste; \nemissions from collection vehicles and waste disposal \nmethods; and by facilitating the spreading of infectious \ndiseases (UNEP, 2018).\n\nThe open burning of waste generates emissions \nof dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and \nblack carbon, which are highly toxic, carcinogenic, \nand powerful short-lived climate pollutants \n(Wilson\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015), and may contribute to global \nclimate change. In parallel, landfills may generate \nhigh amounts of methane, up to 12\u00a0% of total global \nmethane emissions (Wilson et al., 2015). Preventing \nwaste generation and improving its management \ncan avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from \ndisposal, especially through the reduction of landfills. \nThe increase in recycling can prevent GHG emissions \nassociated to production of virgin materials. \n\nImproper waste disposal and leakages from land and \nsea-based activities can lead to mismanaged waste \nreaching and accumulating in the sea, where it can \nhave serious environmental and socio-economic \nimpacts (UNEP, 2018; Wilson et al., 2015). In particular, \nthe plastic fraction can impact marine fauna, mainly \nthrough ingestion and entanglement; moreover, it \ncan be colonised by micro-organisms, and used by \nnon-native and invasive species as a vector of transport \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n35Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n!##\n\n#\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#!!!\n\n!!\n\n#\n\n!#\n\n#\n\n!#\n\n! !! !! !\n\n!#\n\n##\n\n##\n\n!\n!\n\n# !#\n\n#\n\n!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n###\n\n#\n\n#\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!#\n\n####\n\n!\n\n!\n\n#\n\n# #\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!!\n\n!#!\n\n#!!\n\n#!!\n\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!!###\n\n!!\n\n!#!\n\n!!\n\n!!\n\n#\n\n!!\n\n#\n\n!!!!\n##\n\n###\n\n!!!#\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n!!\n\n!\n\n!!\n!!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n####\n\n#\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n##\n\n!!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n##\n#\n\n#\n\n###\n##\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!#!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n#\n\n!!\n\n!!\n\n!\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n#\n\n#\n\n!\n#\n\n#######\n\n!\n\n#!\n\n!\n\n!!#\n\n#\n\n!\n\n#\n\n!!\n\n!!#\n\n#\n\n#!!\n\n###\n\n!!\n\n!!#\n\n#\n\n!\n!\n\n!!\n\n#\n\n###!\n\n!\n\n#!!\n\n# #\n\n!!!\n!\n\n!!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n##\n########\n\n!!\n\n!!\n\n#####\n\n###!#\n\n!!!\n!\n\n!!!\n\n!!!\n!\n!\n!#\n## !!\n\n!\n! !\n!!\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!#\n#\n\n#\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\n!\n!!\n\n! !\n#\n\n!\n\n!\n\n## #\n#\n#\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\n!!\n\n!!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#######\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!!\n\n##!!\n\n###\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!\n\n!###\n\n!\n!\n\n#\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n###\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n! !\n\n!\n\n##\n\n!\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!\n\n#\n#\n\n#\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n##\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n#\n\n##\n##\n\n#\n\n#\n\n##\n\n!\n!!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n### ##\n##\n\n##\n#\n\n##\n###\n\n!!\n!\n!!!!!\n!!!! !!\n\n!!!\n!!!## #\n\n#\n#\n\n##\n###\n#\n\n###\n\n#\n##\n#\n\n##\n#\n\n###\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n###\n\n##\n\n#\n\n###\n\n##\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n\n!!\n!!!!\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n!\n\n##\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n! !\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n##\n## #\n\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n500 1 000 1 500 km0\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI, \u00a9 MedBioLitter\n\nInteractions between marine litter and biodiversity in the Mediterranean\n\nLitter interaction\n\nIngestion\n\nColonisation\n\nEntanglement\n\nOther\n\nEcosystem\n\nPelagic\n\nBenthic\n\nInterreg MED areaEU waters\n\nBiodiversity Protection Community pilot sites\n\nNational MPAs\n\nMarine Protected Area (MPAs)\n\nSPAMIs\n\nNatura 2000 sites EBSAs\n\nFishery Restricted Areas Pelagos Sanctuary\n\nAdriatic Sea\n\nIonian Sea and\n\nAegean-Levantin\ne Se\n\na\n\nB\n\nl a\nc k\n\nS e a\n\nthe Central\n\nM\nediterranean Sea\n\nWestern\nMed\n\niter\nra\n\nne\nan\nSe\na\n\n#\n\n!\n\n! #\n\n! #\n\n! #\n\n! #\n\nacross large distances. To this respect, a meta-analysis \nperformed in the context of the EU-funded project \nPANACeA, reviewed and mapped existing data published \nin scientific literature, providing a spatial assessment of \nthe interactions between marine litter and biodiversity \nin\u00a0the\u00a0Mediterranean, shown in Map\u00a03.1 . \n\nIn the Mediterranean, coastal population and coastal \ntourism are the main drivers associated with waste \ngeneration and management and marine litter \n(see\u00a0Section B). Especially coastal tourism generates \nadditional quantities of waste, in particular drink \nand food packaging, which can entail further stress \nto waste management infrastructures, and lead to \nserious negative environmental impacts. Due to the \nlarge share of population and human activities located \nin the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, waste \nrepresents a significant pressure on coastal and marine \nenvironments, contributing to the generation of beach \nand marine litter and, on the other hand, causing \nvisual pollution and loss of aesthetic value of beaches. \n\nThese threats are especially serious in areas where \ncoastal dumpsites are still used, or are used without \nrehabilitation (UNEP/MAP, 2017a).\n\nAs in other regional seas, marine litter in the \nMediterranean originates predominantly from \nland-based sources and is mostly composed of plastic \n(UNEP/MAP, 2017a). This section focuses mainly \non municipal solid waste (MSW) and gives special \nemphasis to the plastic fraction, as these are potential \nprecursors of marine litter.\n\nThe management of MSW is normally in the hands \nof local authorities and cities, which are responsible \nfor its collection, treatment, and disposal. Because \nof its complex character and its distribution amongst \nmany waste generators, environmentally sound \nmanagement of MSW is complicated (Metaxas and \nSfakianaki, 2011). Moreover, although MSW represents \nonly a part of all the waste generated, its management \noften requires more than one third of the public \n\nSource:  PANACeA.\n\nMap 3.1  Interactions between marine litter and biodiversity in the Mediterranean (2018)\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n36 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nsector's financial efforts to abate and control pollution \n(OECD, 2011), representing an economic burden for \nindustries, municipalities, and households, particularly \nin developing countries. To face this issue, in most \ncountries the government is either the major financier \nof MSW collection and disposal (e.g. in Lebanon and \nTunisia), or fills the gap between the costs and the \nrevenues of MSW (as in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, and \nPalestine). Cost recovery is only partially implemented \nin Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine, while \nMorocco and Tunisia do not recover costs through the \noperation of services. Cost recovery arrangements are \nmade through electricity bills in Egypt and Jordan. \n\n3.1.3 A 'source\u2011to\u2011sea' approach to the waste \nthematic\u00a0area\n\nThe adopted source-to-sea approach to waste and \nmarine litter (Figure 3.1) allows the interactions \nbetween human and natural systems to be assessed \nthrough the adoption of the DPSIR framework. The \nselected H2020 indicators for waste and marine litter \nare proxies to assess the amount of waste that is \ntransferred into the sea. They are intended to inform \nprogress in the waste thematic area in relation to \ndrivers of waste generation, their pressures on the \nenvironment, the state of marine litter and its impacts \n\nSource:  ETC/ICM-Deltares. \n\nFigure 3.1  H2020 indicators for waste and marine litter, used to inform progress across the \nsource-to-sea continuum\n\nWASTE\n\n1.A1.B\n\n1.C 1.D\n\n2.A.2 2.A.1\n\n2.C.1\n\n2.B.1 2.B.2\n\n2.B.3\n\n1.A\n\n1.B\n\n1.C\n\n1.D\n\nMunicipal waste generation & composition\n\nPlastic waste generation per capita\n\n% of population living in coastal areas\n\n% of tourists in coastal areas\n\n2.B.1\n\n2.A.1 Waste collection coverage\n\n2.A.2 Waste captured by formal waste sector\n\n% of waste to uncontrolled dump sites 2.C.1\n\n2.B.2\n\n2.B.3\n\nUncontrolled dump sites in coastal areas\n\nWaste going to dump sites in coastal areas\n\n% of plastic waste generated that is recycled\n\nWATER\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nEMISSIONS\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n37Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\non marine fauna and flora, and the responses in terms \nof waste management (collection, treatment, disposal, \nrecycling, and incineration and energy recovery). \n\n3.1.4 Key waste and marine litter trends\n\nMunicipal solid waste generation \n\nThe quantity of MSW generated in a country is \nclosely related to its economic development, rate \nof urbanisation, its types and patterns of product \nconsumption, household revenue, and lifestyles \n(Spiteri et al., 2016). In particular in the MED South \ncountries, population increase, especially in urban \nareas, improvements in the standard of living, and \nthe growth of tourism represent the key drivers \nof waste generation, especially in coastal areas. In \nfact, consumption growth is generating changes in \nthe production and composition of waste, including \n'new'\u00a0waste streams such as electronic and packaging \nwaste.\n\nThe situation in the Mediterranean is varied not only in \nterms of data availability and quality but also in relation \nto the main trends. MSW generation data for MED EU \ncountries and MED Balkans and Turkey are generally \navailable through Eurostat, while for MED South \ncountries there are fewer data and, in general, they are \nof a relatively lower quality.\n\nData for waste generation in MED South countries \nare not available on a regular basis in all countries \nand, in many cases, only data on waste generated by \nhouseholds were obtained (Figure 3.2). Solid waste \ngenerated in the southern and eastern shores of the \nMediterranean is approximately half that of the EU, \nand relatively modest compared to global trends, \nprimarily due to lower population and income levels \n(Table 3.2). Egypt generates the largest quantity of \n\nUpdated H2020 waste indicators\n\n\u2022 IND 1.A municipal waste generation & composition\n\n\u2022 IND 1.B plastic waste generation per capita\n\n\u2022 IND 1.C\u00a0% population living in coastal areas\n\n\u2022 IND 1.D\u00a0% tourists in coastal areas\n\nMSW by far, producing 21 000 thousand tonnes in \n2012 and 22\u00a0000 thousand tonnes in 2016 (H2020 \nNational Report for Egypt, 2020), while Palestine \nrecorded the lowest quantity of MSW generated (1 \n629 thousand tonnes in 2016, adjusted value (13)). \nIsrael recorded the largest quantity of MSW generated \nper capita, equal to 753\u00a0kg per capita/year in 2016. \nIn\u00a02018, a total of 2\u00a0686\u00a0thousand tonnes of MSW \nwere generated in Tunisia, representing 219\u00a0kg \nper capita/year (H2020\u00a0Country Report for Tunisia, \n2020). The most recent estimates for Palestine, by \nGIZ-SWEEPNET (SWEEPNET, 2014), indicate MSW \ngeneration of 1\u00a0387\u00a0thousand tonnes in 2012, equal \nto 343\u00a0kg per capita/year. Based on this calculation, \nthe total MSW generation was 1\u00a0687 thousand tonnes \nin 2017 and 1\u00a0755\u00a0thousand tonnes in 2018 (H2020 \nNational Report for Palestine, 2020). The MoLG-JICA \nData book (JICA,\u00a02019) estimated MSW generation of \n1\u00a0581\u00a0thousand tonnes in 2019 (957\u00a0thousand tonnes \nin the West Bank and 485 thousand tonnes in the Gaza \nStrip), representing 369 \u00a0kg/year per capita. Finally, \na\u00a0total of 920 thousand tonnes of MSW were generated \nin the Mediterranean part of Morocco in 2018, mainly \nin densely populated areas such as the cities of \nTanger, T\u00e9touan, Nador, and Berkane, representing \n12\u00a0% of the total MSW generated at the national level \n(H2020\u00a0National Report for Morocco, 2020). The available \ndata show an increase in MSW generation since 2004 \nin all MED South countries (see\u00a0Annex B). This trend is \nexpected to continue in the future as population growth \nand income lifestyles evolve. The latest projections to \n2030 and 2050 from the World Bank (World Bank, 2018) \n\u2014 calculated considering both GDP and population \ngrowth \u2014 indicate a steady increase in MSW generation \nin all MED South countries, within a range of +7\u00a0% for \nLebanon to +70\u00a0% for Palestine (2030), and from +35\u00a0% \nfor Morocco to +245\u00a0% for Palestine (2050). Similarly, \nMSW generation in the Mediterranean part of Morocco \nwill reach 1 167\u00a0thousand tonnes in 2030, corresponding \nto 1.27 times the value for 2018 (H2020 National Report \nfor Morocco, 2020).\n\nMSW generation in MED EU and MED Balkans and \nTurkey is illustrated in Figures 3.3 and 3.4 , which show \nMSW generation in absolute terms and per capita. \nOverall, the MED EU countries generated 498\u00a0kg \nper\u00a0capita/year in 2017, compared to 423\u00a0kg\u00a0per \ncapita/year in the Balkans. The highest values were \nrecorded in Cyprus (637\u00a0kg per capita/year) and Malta \n(631\u00a0kg per\u00a0capita/year), and the lowest in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina (352\u00a0kg per capita/year) and Croatia \n(416\u00a0kg per capita/year).\n\n(13) These data were adjusted by the Word Bank (2018) from a variety of origin years to specific years (i.e. 2016, 2030, and 2050), using a regression \nmodel that took into account GDP growth and population growth as drivers of MSW generation.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n38 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nCo\nun\n\ntr\ny\n\n20\n10\n\n-2\n01\n\n2 \n(a )\n\nO\nri\n\ngi\nna\n\nl y\nea\n\nr \nre\n\npo\nrt\n\ned\n\u00a0(b )\n\nYe\nar\n\n20\n16\n\n (b )\n20\n\n30\n p\n\nro\nje\n\nct\nio\n\nn \n(b )\n\n20\n50\n\n p\nro\n\nje\nct\n\nio\nn \n\n(b )\nIn\n\ncr\nea\n\nse\n \n\n20\n16\n\n20\n\n30\n (%\n\n)\n\nIn\ncr\n\nea\nse\n\n \n20\n\n16\n\n20\n50\n\n (%\n)\n\nA\nbs\n\nol\nut\n\ne \nva\n\nlu\nes\n\n \n(1\n\n 0\n00\n\n t\n)\n\nPe\nr \n\nca\npi\n\nta\n \n\n(k\ng/\n\ny)\nA\n\nbs\nol\n\nut\ne \n\nva\nlu\n\nes\n \n\n(1\n 0\n\n00\n t\n\n)\n\nPe\nr \n\nca\npi\n\nta\n \n\n(k\ng/\n\ny)\n\nA\nbs\n\nol\nut\n\ne \nva\n\nlu\nes\n\n (1\n 0\n\n00\n t\n\n)\n\nPe\nr \n\nca\npi\n\nta\n \n\n(k\ng/\n\ny)\n\nA\nbs\n\nol\nut\n\ne \nva\n\nlu\nes\n\n \n(1\n\n 0\n00\n\n t\n)\n\nPe\nr \n\nca\npi\n\nta\n \n\n(k\ng/\n\ny)\n\nA\nbs\n\nol\nut\n\ne \nva\n\nlu\nes\n\n \n(1\n\n 0\n00\n\n t\n)\n\nPe\nr \n\nca\npi\n\nta\n \n\n(k\ng/\n\ny)\n\nAl\nge\n\nri\na\n\n9 \n30\n\n0\n25\n\n8\n12\n\n 3\n79\n\n30\n5\n\n20\n16\n\n12\n 3\n\n79\n30\n\n5\n16\n\n 3\n20\n\n33\n4\n\n21\n 1\n\n72\n36\n\n9\n+3\n\n2\n+7\n\n1\n\nEg\nyp\n\nt\n21\n\n 4\n00\n\n25\n9\n\n21\n 0\n\n00\n23\n\n9\n20\n\n12\n22\n\n 0\n00\n\n (c )\n28\n\n4 \n(c )\n\n34\n 2\n\n14\n28\n\n6\n55\n\n 1\n63\n\n36\n0\n\n+5\n6\n\n+1\n51\n\nIs\nra\n\nel\n4 \n\n80\n0\n\n61\n5\n\n63\n51\n\nd\n75\n\n0\n20\n\n15\n65\n\n31\n (d )\n\n 7\n57\n\n(d )\n7 \n\n10\n9\n\n71\n2\n\n10\n 0\n\n39\n79\n\n8\n+9\n\n+5\n4\n\nJo\nrd\n\nan\n2 \n\n60\n0\n\n41\n9\n\n2 \n53\n\n0\n30\n\n1\n20\n\n13\n3 \n\n49\n6 \n\n(e )  \n(2\n\n01\n8)\n\n33\n9 \n\n(e ) \n(2\n\n01\n8)\n\n3 \n82\n\n5\n34\n\n4\n6 \n\n35\n2\n\n44\n8\n\n+9\n+8\n\n2\n\nLe\nba\n\nno\nn\n\n1 \n90\n\n0\n44\n\n2\n2 \n\n04\n0\n\n36\n4\n\n20\n14\n\n2 \n14\n\n9\n35\n\n8\n2 \n\n30\n3\n\n43\n0\n\n2 \n86\n\n2\n52\n\n9\n+7\n\n+3\n3\n\nLi\nby\n\na\n2 \n\n14\n8\n\n34\n7\n\n20\n11\n\n2 \n42\n\n0\n38\n\n5\n3 \n\n63\n2\n\n49\n5\n\n4 \n61\n\n7\n56\n\n8\n+5\n\n0\n+2\n\n36\n\nM\nor\n\noc\nco\n\n6 \n70\n\n0\n20\n\n7\n6 \n\n85\n2\n\n19\n9\n\n20\n14\n\n7 \n12\n\n6\n20\n\n2\n10\n\n 1\n60\n\n24\n9\n\n15\n 1\n\n58\n33\n\n2\n+4\n\n3\n+1\n\n13\n\nPa\nle\n\nst\nin\n\ne\n1 \n\n50\n0\n\n37\n5\n\n1 \n38\n\n7 \n(f )\n\n34\n3 \n\n(f )\n20\n\n12\n1 \n\n62\n9\n\n34\n0\n\n2 \n76\n\n8\n41\n\n1\n5 \n\n61\n9\n\n57\n9\n\n+7\n0\n\n+2\n45\n\nTu\nni\n\nsi\na\n\n2 \n40\n\n0\n22\n\n4\n2 \n\n70\n0\n\n24\n2\n\n20\n14\n\n2 \n68\n\n6 \n(g ) \n\n (2\n01\n\n8)\n21\n\n9 \n(g ) \n\n(2\n01\n\n8 )\n3 \n\n88\n2\n\n30\n2\n\n5 \n39\n\n9\n38\n\n9\n+4\n\n4\n+1\n\n01\n\nTa\nbl\n\ne \n3.\n\n2 \n \n\nM\nun\n\nic\nip\n\nal\n s\n\nol\nid\n\n w\nas\n\nte\n g\n\nen\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nin\n\n M\nED\n\n S\nou\n\nth\n c\n\nou\nnt\n\nri\nes\n\nSo\nur\n\nce\ns:\n\n  \n(a ) \n\nH\n20\n\n20\n R\n\nep\nor\n\nt (\n20\n\n14\n); \n\n \n(b ) \n\nW\nor\n\nld\n B\n\nan\nk \n\n(2\n01\n\n8)\n; \n\n \n(c ) \n\nH\n20\n\n20\n N\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl R\n\nep\nor\n\nt f\nor\n\n E\ngy\n\npt\n (2\n\n02\n0)\n\n; \n\n \n(d ) \n\nH\n20\n\n20\n N\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl R\n\nep\nor\n\nt f\nor\n\n Is\nra\n\nel\n (2\n\n02\n0)\n\n; \n\n \n(e ) \n\nD\nat\n\na \nfo\n\nr \n20\n\n18\n fr\n\nom\n th\n\ne \nH\n\n20\n20\n\n N\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nl R\nep\n\nor\nt f\n\nor\n Jo\n\nrd\nan\n\n (2\n02\n\n0)\n; \n\n \n(f ) \n\nH\n20\n\n20\n N\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl R\n\nep\nor\n\nt f\nor\n\n P\nal\n\nes\ntin\n\ne \n(2\n\n02\n0)\n\n; \n\n \n(g ) \n\nH\n20\n\n20\n N\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl R\n\nep\nor\n\nt f\nor\n\n T\nun\n\nis\nia\n\n (2\n02\n\n0)\n.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n39Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nLooking at trends over the period 2009-2017, \na\u00a0decrease was recorded in MSW generation in the \nMED EU countries (-5\u00a0%), while the opposite trend \nwas recorded in MED Balkans and Turkey (+17.2\u00a0%), \nalthough the picture is incomplete due to missing data \nfrom Albania and Montenegro. Similarly, per capita \nlevels of MSW generation showed a general decrease \nin the MED EU countries (especially in Cyprus, Italy, \nMalta, Slovenia and Spain) over the same period, with \nthe exception of Greece and Croatia, which recorded \nan increase of 9\u00a0% and 3\u00a0%, respectively. It is worth \nnoting there was a slight increase in MSW generation \nin\u00a0almost all MED EU countries from 2014 onwards \n(+2\u00a0%\u00a0on\u00a0average) which was particularly evident in \nMalta (+9.8\u00a0%) and Slovenia (+9.2\u00a0%). In MED Balkans \nand Turkey, MSW generation per capita followed an \ninitially decreasing trend, with a minimum recorded \nin 2015, after which it started to increase again, \nreaching 423\u00a0kg per capita/year in 2017 (+2\u00a0% over \nthe 2009 levels, and +5\u00a0% over 2014 levels), although \nwith marked differences between Turkey (+9.4\u00a0%) and \nMontenegro (-7.5\u00a0%).\n\nMunicipal solid waste composition \n\nMSW composition has direct implications on waste \ncollection and disposal methods, as well as on the \nquantity and type of waste that reaches the sea. \nFigure\u00a03.5 presents the available data on waste \ncomposition across the Mediterranean (World Bank, \n2018). Organic and green waste is the predominant \ntype of waste, especially in the MED South countries \n(with\u00a0an average of 56\u00a0%), but also in the MED Balkans \nand Turkey (average of 37.9\u00a0%) and the MED EU (average \nof 40.8\u00a0%).

In Egypt, MSW constitutes about 25\u00a0% of solid waste. The quantities of MSW \ngenerated are calculated on a daily basis by the municipalities of each governorate. Based on the data collected, the annual \nquantity of waste generated is calculated for each governorate and for the country as a whole. \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWaste density is influenced by waste composition, so it is important to define the number and capacity of waste storage and \ncollection facilities required. Based on waste density and the capacity of the trucks, the amount of waste collected can be \nmeasured in tonnes (weight). In Egypt, the average density of waste is about 300\u00a0kg/m3, which is comparable to that in other \ndeveloping countries. The relatively high density measured in Egypt reduces the effectiveness of compaction vehicles for \nwaste transportation.\n\nThe average MSW composition at the national scale in the relevant fractions is also calculated, based on the information \ncoming from the municipalities. Organic waste is the major component of MSW, followed by plastic waste.

At the \nnational level, the MSW collection rate increased from 44\u00a0% in 2008 to 79\u00a0% in 2012, thanks to the implementation of the \nPNDM (Plan National de G\u00e9stion des D\u00e9chets M\u00e9nagers et assimil\u00e9s, National Waste Management Plan). Subsequently, the \nMSW collection rate in urban centres further increased to reach 81\u00a0% in 2013 and 2014, and 85.2\u00a0% in 2016 and 2018.

In urban centres, door-to-door waste \ncollection by trucks is the most common practice, \nwhile source separation is not common. The picture is \ndrastically different in slums, which house a sizeable \nshare of the urban population (e.g. in Egypt; UNEP, \n2018). Here, waste-collection services are either \n\nlimited or non-existent, partly due to poor road \naccess and a lack of waste infrastructure. The roads in \nslum areas are usually narrow, unpaved and sloping, \nand are also slippery during rainy seasons, which \nmeans modern waste-collection systems are not \neasy to implement under such conditions. Social and \ntechnological innovation is required to ensure that \nall urban residents have access to waste-collection \nservices.\n\nNote:  Maximum chosen as reported for households, geographical area, or waste.\n\nSource:  World Bank, 2018, except for Tangier, H2020 National Report for Morocco, 2020.\n\nTable 3.6  Municipal solid waste collection rates in 2018 in selected cities in MED South countries (%)\n\nCity Proportion of MSW collected (%)\n\nTangier, Morocco 96\n\nTunis, Tunisia 61\n\nCairo, Egypt 77\n\nSousse, Tunisia 99\n\nAlgiers, Algeria 100\n\nAmman, Jordan 100\n\nBeirut, Lebanon 100\n\nSaida, Lebanon 100\n\nTripoli, Libya 100\n\nBox 3.3  Automated waste collection in Israel\n\nIsrael's, first pneumatic waste-collection system (the automated vacuum collection (AVAC) system), was built in 2012 in the \ngreen neighbourhood of Neot Rabin in the city of Yavne. Residents dispose of waste in two garbage chutes: dry waste in one \nand wet waste in the other. Residents place the rubbish in chutes and it is collected automatically in an underground storage \nunit, from which it is pumped through a network of underground pipes to a centralised garbage storage unit. Waste is then \nsorted, compacted and transferred by truck to the final disposal sites. In 2014, Yavne started to expand the network across \nother districts, so that in 2015, about 30 pneumatic waste-collection points were established in public areas, soon followed \nby two other municipalities (Ra'anana and Bat Yam).\n\nAlthough the system seems to be rather inflexible towards more than two fractions of waste (i.e. dry and wet), the AVAC \nensured the elimination of odour associated with waste and reduced traffic congestion. However, it requires a high initial \ninvestment and maintenance, including a trained workforce, and needs citizens to engage in the separate disposal of waste.\n\nSource:  World Bank, 2018.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n48 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nAlthough a sizeable share of population lives in \nrural areas in many of the MED South countries, \nespecially in Egypt (14) (57\u00a0% in 2018), in some cases, \nwaste-management services are either limited or \nnon-existent in such areas. It is true that rural coverage \nis relatively high for most MED South countries, with \nan average of 74\u00a0% of waste being collected. However, \nthere is a significant variation across countries: in \nTunisia and Egypt, 5\u00a0% and 15\u00a0% of rural waste is \ncollected, respectively. As a result, rural waste that \nis not reused or recycled is often illegally dumped or \nopenly burned on-site. This has become particularly \nproblematic with the increasing consumption of \nplastic, health-care materials, and disposable nappies. \nHowever, there is a scarcity of data and information \non rural waste generation, including the quantity, \ncomposition, sources and management of waste. \nNormally, rural areas are assumed to have lower \nconsumption levels and to generate less waste per \ncapita, with a high organic content. As such, there is \n\npotential in MED South countries to apply composting \nand biogas technologies (UNEP, 2018).\n\nTraditionally, waste-collection services are provided \nby municipalities or private contractors. However, \nthe role of the informal sector and community-based \norganisations in waste collection is equally important in \nmany MED South countries (see Box 3.5). For example, \nan estimated 96 000 informal waste pickers are active \nin Cairo and account for 10\u00a0% of the waste collected in \nthe city (World Bank, 2018). Several thousand barbachas \n('waste pickers' in the local language) are estimated to \noperate in Tunisia, without any type of social coverage \nand often in a precarious situation (H2020 National \nReport for Tunisia, 2020). As such, in these countries \nthere is a significant opportunity to improve waste \nmanagement by including informal actors, which may \nensure a higher and more efficient coverage of the \ncity and have positive effects in terms of economic \nrevenues and social inclusion (UNEP, 2018).\n\nBox 3.4  Assessment of waste collection coverage in Egypt \n\nIn Egypt, the collection and transportation of MSW constitute the largest financial burden on the available budget and has \nthe biggest impact on the quality of life. The picture is further complicated by the fact that the limited funds are often used \nto acquire inferior and often inappropriate collection equipment, or to maintain an insufficient collection fleet.\n\nInformation about the efficiency of waste collection and transportation is not very consistent in Egypt, as shown below \nby the technical performance summary on municipal waste coverage in both rural and urban areas, including recycling, \ncomposting and open dumped waste.  \n\nSource:  GIZ (2014)\n\n H2020 Country Report for Egypt, 2019\n\nTable 3.7  Technical performance summary for municipal waste, Egypt\n\nMSW collection coverage: %\n\nRural areas 0-30\n\nUrban areas 50-65\n\nMSW final destination\n\nComposted 7\n\nRecycled 10-15\n\nOpenly dumped 80-88\n\nNumber of dump sites \nNumber of controlled landfills \nNumber of sanitary landfills: \nPlanned 22\n\nUnder construction 2\n\nConstructed \nOperational 7\n\n(14)  https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/rural-population-percent-of-total-population-wb-data.html\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n49Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nMunicipal solid waste treatment and disposal\n\nBox 3.5  Informal recycling in Egypt\n\nThe informal processing of recyclable waste, especially organic waste, plays an important role in Cairo's waste management. \nStreet scavengers search through both public and private waste containers, picking out virtually any material that can \nbe sold. In many parts of Cairo, as well as in some other governorates, the so-called 'Zabbaleen' (informal garbage \ncollectors) have long-standing door-service collection arrangements. Material collected on these routes is brought to the \nZabbaleen's sorting and processing facilities where it is cleaned and possibly reprocessed before being sold, either locally \nor\u00a0internationally. \n\nUntil 2009, the Zabbaleen were mainly using organic waste collected from houses to feed 200 000 to 300 000 pigs reared \nin the district where they live. During the 2009 swine flu epidemic, however, the Egyptian government decided to sacrifice \nall herds of pigs as a safety measure. This action resulted in the Zabbaleen losing interest in organic waste. As a result, they \nstarted to perform segregation at source, leaving behind all the organic waste accumulating in the streets. This change in the \ndynamics of the collection and transfer process resulted in a significant reduction in income for the Zabbaleen community. \nIt\u00a0also forced the Cairo governorate to explore other options for handling the disposal of food waste, which makes up \nroughly 50\u00a0% of Cairo's waste stream.\n\nSource:  World Bank, (2018): \n\n (a) Egypt State of Environment Report (2016), as cited by H2020 National Report for Egypt (2019); \n\n (b) H2020 National Report for Israel (2020); \n\n (c) H2020 National Report for Palestine (2020).\n\nTable 3.8  Share of waste treated and disposed of in MED South countries, latest year available \n(%\u00a0of\u00a0total MSW) \n\nCountry Open dump Landfill \nunspecified\n\nControlled \nlandfill\n\nSanitary \nlandfill\n\nRecycling Composting Year(s)\n\nAlgeria 2 89 8.0 1 2016, 2013\n\nEgypt (a) 81 7 12.0 2013\n\nIsrael 75 24 (b) 2017\n\nJordan 45 48 7.0 2014\n\nLebanon 29 48 8.0 15.0 2014\n\nLibya\n\nMorocco 52 37 8.0 1.0 2014\n\nPalestine (c) 32 65 3.0 2013\n\nSyria 80 20 2.5 1.5\n\nTunisia 21 70 4.0 5.0 2014\n\nAVERAGE 54 44 28 63 10.0 6.0\n\nUpdated H2020 waste indicators\n\n\u2022 IND 2.B.1\u00a0% Waste going to uncontrolled dump sites\n\n\u2022 IND 2.B.2 Uncontrolled dump sites in coastal areas\n\n\u2022 IND 2.B.3 Waste going to dump sites in coastal areas \n\n\u2022 IND 2.C\u00a0% Plastic waste generated that is recycled\n\nThere are significant gaps in MSW treatment data in \nMED South countries, as shown in Tables 3.8 and 3.9. \nIn 2012, the treatment rate reached 100\u00a0% of the MSW \ncollected in Israel, while in Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, \nand Lebanon, this rate was 19\u00a0%, 31\u00a0%, 50\u00a0%, and 70\u00a0%, \nrespectively (EEA and UNEP/MAP, 2014).\n\nTable 3.8 shows the share of waste treatment in \nMED South countries (World Bank, 2018). More than \nhalf of the waste collected in MED South countries is \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n50 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\ndisposed of in open dumps (54\u00a0%), mainly because it \nis considered to be a cheap way of getting rid of solid \nwaste (UNEP, 2018). In fact, dump sites are frequently \nfound around communities such as refugee camps, and \nin or near countries experiencing conflict. Furthermore, \nin high-income countries, most landfills are not \nengineered landfills and effectively operate as dumps. \nIn 2013, this fraction was highest in Egypt (84\u00a0%), and \nlowest in Tunisia (21\u00a0%; see Box 3.6 for a description of \nwaste treatment in Tunisia). The next most commonly \nused method of treatment is landfilling which accounts \nfor more than 99\u00a0% of waste collected in Tunisia and \nJordan, and 90\u00a0% in Morocco. This ratio is very low in \nEgypt (5\u00a0%), where the percentage of MSW disposal in \nopen dumps is highest among MED South countries. \nIn Greater Cairo, only 35\u00a0% of the population is served \nby a sanitary landfill. There are about 940 dumps in \nLebanon for MSW, as well as for construction and \ndemolition waste. A regional study (SWEEPNET,\u00a02014) \ncounted 75 uncontrolled dump sites in the \nMediterranean coastal areas of Egypt, although other \nunofficial estimates put this number at over 400 (H2020 \nNational Report for Egypt, 2019). In Palestine, recent \nestimates highlighted the presence of 83 uncontrolled \ndump sites in the West Bank (JICA, 2019), and 3 in \nthe Gaza Strip (H2020 National Report for Palestine, \n2020). In the Mediterranean part of Morocco, a total of \n24\u00a0uncontrolled dump sites have been recorded, where \nabout 19\u00a0% of all MSW generated was discharged in \nthe period 2014-2018, from up to 93\u00a0% in the period \n2006-2010 (H2020 National Report for Morocco, 2020). \nFinally, Israel reported that the last uncontrolled dump \nsite officially close in 2013 (H2020 National Report for \nIsrael, 2020).\n\nMED South countries are slowly upgrading their \nend-of-life disposal infrastructure, from open dumping \nto controlled dumping, controlled landfilling, and \nsanitary engineered landfilling. In Morocco, the share \nof waste that has been treated increased from 19\u00a0% \nin the period 2006-2010 to 31\u00a0% in 2010-2014, and \n92\u00a0%\u00a0in 2014-2018, while, in parallel, the share of \nwaste discharged in open dump sites fell from 93\u00a0% to \n31\u00a0%\u00a0and 19\u00a0%, respectively (H2020 National Report for \nMorocco, 2020). Although landfilling has been steadily \ndecreasing since 1995 (EEA and UNEP/MAP, 2014), \nit shows some signs of an upsurge, at least in some \ncountries such as Israel and Palestine. World Bank \n(2018) reports an increase in MSW disposal in sanitary \nlandfills in Morocco from 10\u00a0% in 2008 to 32\u00a0% in 2012 \nand 53\u00a0% in 2016, with an expected maximum share of \n80\u00a0% (World Bank, 2018). However, experience shows \nthat, once established, engineered landfills are often not \noperated in accordance with design specifications or \nlegislation, owing to various operational challenges. This, \nin addition to poor monitoring of waste flows, leads to \nthe poor generation of knowledge to support treatment \nschemes, especially in relation to waste recycling.\n\nMunicipal solid waste recycling \n\nRecycling means any recovery operation by which \nwaste materials are reprocessed into products, \nmaterials or substances, whether for the original or \nother purposes, except for use as fuel.

MSW is managed by municipalities which are in charge of waste collection, transport and disposal, and the \nNational Agency of Waste Management (ANGED) which, through private enterprises, manages the controlled discharge of \nwaste.\n\nIn 2018, MSW generation was estimated at about 2 686 420 tonnes, of which almost 75\u00a0% came from the 10 governorates \nin the north-east and east of the country. Daily waste generation per capita has been estimated at about 0.6\u00a0kg/day, with \nimportant differences between cities (>1\u00a0kg per capita/day) and rural areas (0.15\u00a0kg per capita/day).\n\nAs for waste treatment, the figure shows that an increase trend was recorded in waste treatment in controlled discharge \nsites from 2015 to 2018 in the country. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nSource:   H2020 National Report for Tunisia based on ANGED 2018. \n\nFigure 3.8  Evolution of MSW treatment in controlled discharge sites in Tunisia between 2015 \nand\u00a02018 (thousand tonnes)\n\n0\n\n3 000 100\n\n90\n\nThousand tonnes Percentage (%)\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n500\n\n1 000\n\n1500\n\n2 000\n\n2 500\n\nWaste generated Waste treated Share of waste treated\n\nRecycling is still limited in MED South countries (see \nTable 3.10, and Box 3.7 for the description of waste \nrecycling in Tunisia). The average MSW recycling rate in \nMED South countries is only 4\u00a0% (UNEP, Africa, 2018), \nwith a minimum in Palestine (1\u00a0% in 2015). In Israel, \n24\u00a0% of MSW was recycled in 2017. In Morocco, a share \nof 25\u00a0% of all plastics generated was recycled in 2015, \nwhile the estimated volume of all MSW recycled in the \nMediterranean part of Morocco was 92\u00a0000 tonnes, \nrepresenting about 10\u00a0% of the total MSW generated \n(H2020 National Report for Morocco, 2020). There are \nonly a few on-site material recovery facilities (MRFs) \n\nwhich, however, are often badly equipped (UNEP, 2018). \nThe informal sector plays an active role in collecting \nrecyclable material to supply both local and international \nend-use markets (UNEP, 2018). In Tunisia and Morocco, \nthis is strongly supported by the municipality and, \noccasionally, by the producers (UNEP, 2018). In particular \nin Morocco, a recent study estimated the number of \ninformal collectors at 7 100, with a total annual turnover \nof about EUR 16 million (PSIE II, 2011). Around 2.5\u00a0% \nof MSW was recycled in Egypt in 2012; 433 200 tonnes \nwere recycled by the formal sector, and 979 400 tonnes \nwere recycled by the informal sector, especially by the \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n52 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n20\n00\n\n20\n01\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n03\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n05\n\n20\n06\n\n20\n07\n\n20\n08\n\n20\n09\n\n20\n10\n\n20\n11\n\n20\n12\n\n20\n13\n\n20\n14\n\n20\n15\n\n20\n16\n\n20\n17\n\nAlgeria 10 10\n\nEgypt 6 7 2\n\nIsrael (a) 11 11 12 12 14 15 14 16 18 19 20 20 21 22 24\n\nLebanon 3 7 8 8\n\nMorocco 2 10 10\n\nPalestine 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nTunisia 0\n\nTable 3.10  Share of Municipal solid waste recycled in MED South countries between 2000 and 2015 \n(%\u00a0of\u00a0total MSW)\n\nSource:  UNSD Country Files (2018): \n\n (a) H2020 National Report for Israel (2020).\n\nBox 3.7  Tunisia's Eco-Lef recycling system \n\nThe Eco-Lef programme, launched in 1997 by the Ministry of Environment and administered by ANGED, developed a national \nsystem for the recovery and recycling of post-consumer packaging, primarily focused on plastic waste. A 5\u00a0% tax on the net \nadded value of certain locally manufactured or imported plastic polymers provides the necessary funding to the programme. \n\nThe 221 Eco-Lef collection centres receive plastic and metal packaging from both individuals and informal collectors in \nexchange for a remuneration that is usually higher than local market prices. A total of 14 centres are managed by ANGED, \nwhile the others are managed by the private sector. Since its launch in 2001, more than 150 000 tonnes of plastic packaging \nwaste have been collected, 70-90\u00a0% of which has been recycled, and about 18 000 jobs have been created. In 2018, \n3\u00a0500\u00a0tonnes of packaging were collected, while 148 units recycle 97\u00a0% of the volume collected. The success of the Eco-Lef \nprogramme shows the importance of government support to develop a recycling value chain, the private sector's role in \nensuring financial sustainability and operational efficiency, and the integration of informal waste pickers. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource:  ANGED, rapport d'activit\u00e9 2018\n\n World Bank, 2018\n\nFigure 3.9  Evolution of plastic and metal packaging recovered by ECO-Lef between 2001 and 2018 \n(tonnes)\n\n2 000\n\n4 000\n\n6 000\n\n8 000\n\n10 000\n\n12 000\n\n14 000\n\n16 000\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nTonnes\n\n0\n\n18 000\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n53Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\ncommunity of Zabbaleen.

In 2018, 10\u00a0% of total MSW generated per \ncapita in MED EU in 2018 were incinerated or recovered \nfor energy production, ranging from 0\u00a0% (in Croatia \nand Malta) to 35\u00a0% (France; see Table 3.11). Although \nnew EU recycling targets aim not to extend waste \nincineration, and notwithstanding the limited data \navailability, it is possible to observe that in the period \n2007-2017, waste incineration and energy recovery \nhad a slow increase trend in the MED EU (from 7\u00a0% of \ntotal MSW generated in 2007 to 10\u00a0% in 2017), while \nin\u00a0Albania it increased from 3\u00a0% in 2017 to 5\u00a0% in 2018. \nIn parallel, waste recovery is not common in MED South \ncountries, because of the high costs if compared to \nuncontrolled dumping\n\nMunicipal solid waste landfilling\n\nMSW landfilled in the MED EU countries reached an \naverage of 224\u00a0kg per capita/year in 2018, corresponding \nto 43\u00a0% of all MSW generated, and ranging from \n47\u00a0kg\u00a0per capita/y in Slovenia (10% of all MSW generated) \nto 550\u00a0kg per capita/y in Malta (86\u00a0%; see Figure 3.12 \nShare of waste disposed in landfills (and other) of total \nmunicipal solid waste generated in MED EU and MED \nBalkans and Turkey (%)). Among the countries in MED \nBalkans and Turkey, the limited data available show \nthat an average of 79\u00a0% of waste was landfilled in \n2017, from a low of 63\u00a0% in Albania, to a high of 93\u00a0% \nin Montenegro. Disposal of waste in landfills per capita \nhad a steady decrease trend in MED EU countries, from \n72\u00a0% to 52\u00a0% of total MSW generated. This trend was \nespecially strong in Slovenia (from 65\u00a0% in 2007 to 10\u00a0% \nin 2017), Italy (from 52\u00a0% to 23\u00a0%), and Croatia (from \n96\u00a0% to 72\u00a0%), while Greece recorded a stable and high \nlandfill rate (80\u00a0%) in the same period. The available \ndata for MED Balkan countries show an increase of \nwaste landfilled per capita in Albania (from 63\u00a0% in 2017 \nto 76\u00a0% in 2018), and a slight decrease in Montenegro \n(from\u00a093\u00a0% to 88\u00a0%) and Turkey (from 84\u00a0% to 82\u00a0%).\n\nSource:  Eurostat, 2020b.\n\nFigure 3.12  Share of waste disposed in landfills (and other) of total municipal solid waste generated \nin\u00a0MED EU, MED Balkans and Turkey (%)\n\nAve\nra\n\nge\n M\n\nED\n\nBalka\nns a\n\nnd Turk\ney\n\nMontenegr\no\n\nAlbania\n\nBosn\nia &\n\n H\nerze\n\ngo\nvin\n\na\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercentage\n\n0\n\n120\n\nCro\natia\n\nCyp\nru\n\ns\n\nFra\nnce\n\nGre\nece Ita\n\nly\nMalta\n\nSlo\nve\n\nnia\nSp\n\nain\n\nTurk\ney\n\nAve\nra\n\nge\n\nMED EU\n\n2007 2017 2018\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n56 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nMarine litter sources: from land to sea\n\nAccording to the 2017 Mediterranean QSR \n(UNEP/MAP, 2017a), 'shoreline activities \n(including\u00a0poor\u00a0waste\u00a0management practices, tourism \nand recreation), along with sea/waterway activities, \nsmoking-related activities, and the dumping and \nimproper disposal of medical/personal hygiene items \nare among the main beach marine litter sources' in \nthe Mediterranean. Tourism plays an important role \nin marine-litter generation. Marine litter can double \nduring the summer season (UNEP/MAP, 2017a), while \nin some tourist areas over 75\u00a0% of annual waste \nproduction is generated during the summer season \n(Wilson et\u00a0al., 2015). Other land-based sources of \nmarine litter include fly tipping, industry (especially \nthe food-processing industry on the southern and \neastern shores), and the energy and chemical \nindustries (on the northern shore), inadvertent release \nof litter from coastal landfills and garbage from water \ntransport, and unprotected waste disposal sites \n(Wilson et al.,\u00a02015). Rivers, drains, sewage outlets and \nstorm-water outflows, road run-off, and wind are the \nmain routes through which marine litter ends up in \nMediterranean coasts and waters (Wilson et al.,\u00a02015). \nAn important role in the Mediterranean basin is \nplayed by intermittent rivers which are completely or \nalmost dry during some seasons, or only carry water \nfor very short periods (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2016). This can \nmake a significant contribution to the peak transport \nof marine litter, dumped on the riverbed during the \ndry or rainy season.\n\nSea-based sources of marine litter include shipping, \nrecreational boating, the fishing industry, and offshore \noil and gas platforms, with litter entering the sea \nthrough both accidental and deliberate discharges of \nitems ranging from galley waste to cargo containers \n(Seas at Risk, 2017). In the Mediterranean, recent \nestimates indicate that sea-based sources account for \n5\u00a0% of marine litter, possibly due to the role played \nby port-reception facilities, and by the obligation of \nvessels\u00a0above 400 tonnes, or carrying more than \n15\u00a0people, to implement garbage management \nplans in\u00a0accordance with international maritime law \n(Wilson\u00a0et al., 2015).\n\nLitter washed ashore on coasts and in the water column \n\nSeveral monitoring initiatives have collected data on \nthe presence of litter washed ashore along coastlines \nand in the water column across the Mediterranean. The \nMarine Litter Watch initiative aims to empower citizen \ncommunities to provide relevant data through a mobile \napp, while creating more awareness of marine litter at \n\nthe local level. All data collected are published on a web \nportal and a public database.  \n\nFigure 3.13 summarises the results of citizen-led \nmarine-litter data collection activities on Mediterranean \nbeaches, including the number of surveys performed \nand the temporal range. The results show that plastic \npieces represent 74\u00a0% to 95\u00a0% of all marine litter found \nin Mediterranean beaches, with an average of 86\u00a0%, \nfollowed by glass (4\u00a0% on average) and metal (3.5\u00a0%). \nThese figures are in line with a compilation of available \nstudies and publications listing the main marine \nlitter items found on European beaches (Addamo et \nal., 2017), developed by the European Commission's \nJoint Research Centre (JRC) within the Marine Strategy \nFramework Directive (MSFD; 2008/56/EC) Technical \nGroup on Marine Litter. The results of this report show \nthat synthetic polymer materials represented 84\u00a0% \nof all marine litter items found on European beaches \nin 2016. Approximately 50\u00a0% of marine beach litter \nitems are single-use plastics (SUPs), including bottles, \nbags, caps/lids, strings and cords, cigarette butts, crisp \npackets and sweet wrappers, while plastic fragments \n(size range: 0-2.5 cm and 2.5-50 cm) represent about \n25\u00a0% of marine litter. A recent study classified the litter \nfound at the Hammamet beach in Tunisia (Fondation \nHeinrich B\u00f6ll, 2019): 68\u00a0% of the litter washed ashore \ncomprised plastic items, followed by paper (10\u00a0%), \nmetals (7\u00a0%), textile (7\u00a0%) and cigarette butts (3\u00a0%). \nIn\u00a0parallel, in a study by UNEP in Egypt on the beaches \nof three Mediterranean coastal cities (Matroh, \nAlexandria and Port Said), synthetic polymer materials \ncomprised 94\u00a0% of the total litter washed ashore \n(H2020 National Report for Egypt, 2019). \n\nMarine litter from smoking-related activities is \na\u00a0particularly serious problem in the Mediterranean, \nwhere it accounts for almost 40\u00a0% of total marine \nlitter items and 53.5\u00a0% of the top 10 items counted \nin 2013, a figure considerably higher than the \nglobal average (UNEP/MAP, 2017a). Finally, the \ncontribution of fishery-related litter could be estimated \nat between\u00a0about 3\u00a0% and 15\u00a0% of marine litter \n(Addamo\u00a0et al.,\u00a02017).\n\nThe overall picture on marine litter in the \nMediterranean is fragmented and geographically \nrestricted to the northern part of the basin. Recent \nestimates by Jambeck et al., (2015), adapted \nfrom UNEP/MAP (2015), calculate the quantity of \nmismanaged plastic waste and plastic waste entering \nthe Mediterranean (see Table 3.12). It emerges that \nthe amounts of plastic waste littered across the \nMediterranean vary significantly, with an average of \nabout 1\u00a0kg per capita/year, ranging from a minimum \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n57Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nNote:  Chemicals category: 0.004\u00a0%; unidentified: 0.05\u00a0% (not shown).\n\nSource:  Marine Litter Watch database; accessed February 2020.\n\nFigure 3.13  Composition of beach marine litter in Mediterranean countries (%)\n\nPlastic Rubber Clothes/Textile Paper and cardboard\n\nWood Metal Glass and ceramics Chemicals Unidentified\n\n86 %\n\n1 %\n\n2 %\n2 %\n\n1 %\n\n4 %\n4 %\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nFrance\n\nGreece\n\nItaly\n\nMalta\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nAlgeria\n\nIsrael\n\nTunisia\n\nBosnia & Herzegovina\n\nMontenegro\n\nTurkey\n\n0 2010 70 80 90 100\n\nPercentage\n\nof 0.15\u00a0kg per capita/year in Morocco to 2.16\u00a0kg per \ncapita/year in Israel.\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea is heavily impacted by floating \nmarine litter, with concentrations comparable to \nthose found in the five subtropical gyres (UNEP/MAP, \n2017a). A floating litter abundance of 0 to 600 items \nper km2 has been recorded (UNEP/MAP, 2017a). Recent \nresearch shows that floating marine-litter items are \nmainly made up of artificial polymer materials, such \nas plastic bags, wrappings, bottles, tableware and \npolystyrene boxes used by fishermen (Bigagli et al., \n2019). Significant marine litter hot spots have been \nidentified in areas close to land, and have recorded \nan increase in floating marine litter during spring \nand summer (Arcangeli et al., 2018; Campana et al., \n2018). The Mediterranean seafloor also seems to be \nhighly impacted by marine litter, with approximately \n0.5\u00a0billion litter items (Wilson et al., 2015) and densities \nranging between 0 and more than 7 700 items per km\u00b2, \nespecially in deep-sea canyons (UNEP/MAP, 2017a).\n\nIn summary, the limited spatial and temporal \navailability of data and information on marine litter \nin the Mediterranean \u2014 with most data found for \nthe northern shores and limited temporal ranges \u2014 \ntogether with the lack of consistency and comparability \n(Bigagli et al., 2019) hinder the possibility to generate \nconclusions at basin scale on the quantity and \ndistribution of marine litter in the Mediterranean, \nas well on accumulation and loading rates and the \ncorresponding fluxes (UNEP/MAP, 2017a).\n\n3.1.4 Policies on waste prevention and municipal solid \nwaste management in the Mediterranean \n\nThe picture of existing legal and policy frameworks for \nthe management of MSW is quite distinct across the \nshores of the Mediterranean. While all Mediterranean \ncountries participate, although to differing extents, \nto the majority of existing international agreements \non waste management, MED EU countries have an \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n58 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nadditional legal and policy layer, represented by the \nprovisions of EU waste management legislation.\n\nSeveral policies have been adopted in the EU to \nregulate all aspects of waste management, foster waste \nprevention, reduction/reuse/recycle, and to regulate \nwaste discharge and disposal activities. They include \nprovisions to avoid the generation of waste or to \nestablish structures and mechanisms to recycle waste, \nas well as to avoid waste disposal into the environment. \nThe main legislation is the Waste Framework Directive \n(2008/98/EC; EU, 2008b) which introduces the waste \nhierarchy, in which waste prevention has the highest \npriority, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling \nand other recovery and, finally, disposal as the least \ndesirable option (EU, 2008b, 2018b). Moreover, it \nincludes measures for preventing and reducing adverse \n\neffects from the generation and management of waste \nto reduce the overall impacts of resource use and \nimprove resource efficiency. It includes targets for the \nreuse and recycling of waste up to 2035 and requires \nMember States to develop waste-management plans \nand waste-prevention programmes.\n\nIn line with the waste hierarchy, more than 30 binding \ntargets have been set for the management of waste for \nthe period 2015-2035 in the EU (EEA, 2019e), through \nspecific legislation, including:\n\n\u2022 the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive \n(94/62/EC; EC, 1994) which aims to harmonise \nnational measures concerning the management \nof packaging and packaging waste to prevent or \nreduce its impact on the environment;\n\nNote:  * inputs from Egypt, France, Morocco, Spain and Turkey were estimated for the Mediterranean coast only (adapted from Jambeck \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).\n\nSource:  UNEP/MAP, 2015.\n\nTable 3.12  Estimated plastic mismanaged and littered at sea from Mediterranean countries \n(kg\u00a0per\u00a0capita/year)\n\nCountry Coastal population Mismanaged plastic waste \n[kg/person/year]\n\nPlastic waste littered  \n[kg/person/year]\n\nAlbania 2 530 533 11.74 0.50\n\nAlgeria 16 556 580 31.44 1.05\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina 585 582 22.12 1.05\n\nCroati 1 602 782 10.27 1.83\n\nCyprus 840 556 2.17 1.81\n\nEgypt 21 750 943 44.46 1.29\n\nFrance 17 287 280 1.39 1.39\n\nGreece 9 794 702 1.45 1.45\n\nIsrael 6 677 810 2.85 2.16\n\nItaly 33 822 532 0.97 0.97\n\nJordan 55 392 31.36 1.05\n\nLebanon 3 890 871 12.29 0.68\n\nLibya 4 050 128 13.03 1.05\n\nMalta 404 707 6.47 1.55\n\nMontenegro 260 336 16.96 1.05\n\nMorocco 17 303 431 17.92 0.53\n\nPalestine 3 045 258 1.84 0.46\n\nSlovenia 336 594 1.65 1.06\n\nSpain 22 771 488 2.01 2.01\n\nSyria 3 621 997 43.60 1.30\n\nTunisia 7 274 973 32.21 1.05\n\nTurkey 34 042 862 14.27 1.54\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n59Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n\u2022 the Port Reception Facilities Directive (2019/883/\nEU; EU, 2019a) which aims to reduce discharges, \nespecially illegal discharges, of ship-generated waste \nand cargo residues into the sea by improving the \navailability and use of port-reception facilities in EU \nMember State ports;\n\n\u2022 the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC; EC, 1999) \ndefines technical requirements for landfill design \nand operation, and includes targets regarding the \namount of waste that can be landfilled, eventually \nensuring that landfilled waste would not exceed \n10\u00a0% of total MSW generated by 2035;\n\n\u2022 the Plastic Bags Directive (2015/720; EU, 2015a) \nto limit the annual per-capita consumption of \nlightweight plastic bags to 90 by 31 December 2019 \nand 40 by 31 December 2025, and/or requesting \nthat lightweight carrier bags are not provided free of \ncharge at the point of sales of goods or products by \n31 December 2018; \n\n\u2022 the Single-Use Plastics (SUP) Directive (2019/904; \nEU,\u00a02019b) addresses the 10 single-use plastic \nproducts most often found on Europe's beaches \nand seas by banning some SUP products, requiring \na significant reduction in the consumption of \nselected plastic items, and requiring labelling and/or \nEPR schemes for certain plastic items; and\n\n\u2022 Other acts targeting specific waste streams, such \nas waste from electric and electronic equipment \n(2012/19/EU; EU, 2012), batteries and waste \nbatteries (2006/66/EC; EC, 2006), end-of-life \nvehicles (2000/53/EC; EC, 2000), urban waste water \ntreatment (91/271/EEC; EU, 1991), specific chemicals \nin recycled plastics (through REACH Regulation no. \n1907/2006), and the emissions of solid particles, \nsuch as plastic pellets, from industrial operations \n(Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU; \nEU,\u00a02010).\n\nA key policy for tackling marine litter in the \nMediterranean is the EU Marine Strategy Framework \nDirective (2008/56/EC; EC, 2008) which is the major \nbinding legal instrument to protect the EU's marine \nenvironment. Under the MSFD, Member States are \nrequired to assess, monitor, and set environmental \ntargets and measures to achieve a GES for European \noceans and seas by 2020. The GES is articulated along \n11 qualitative descriptors, among which descriptor \n10 focuses on marine litter, requiring Member States \nto ensure that 'properties and quantities of marine \nlitter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine \nenvironment'.\n\nThe EU Circular Economy Package confirmed the target \nfor reducing marine litter by 30\u00a0% by 2020 for the 10 \nmost common types of litter found on beaches, as well \nas for fishing gear found at sea. To this end, in 2018, \nthe Commission adopted the EU Plastics Strategy with \nthe aim of 'transforming the way plastic products are \ndesigned, used, produced and recycled in the EU', \nprotecting the environment from plastic pollution while \nat the same time fostering growth and innovation.\n\nTable 3.13 shows the laws and policies in place \nfor waste management in MED South countries \nand MED Balkans and Turkey. Overall, the legal \nframework for waste management in the MED South \ncountries is often fragmented and the provisions \ndealing with MSW are weak (UNEP, 2018). This was \nfound in Egypt, for example, where there is no clear \ndistinction between roles and responsibilities of the \ngovernorates,\u00a0municipalities, service providers and \nwaste generators.\n\nThe responsibilities of solid waste management \npolicies and planning at the national level are \ngenerally shared between ministries and specific \ninstitutions, such as dedicated solid waste management \nagencies (Algeria and Tunisia); national committees \n(Morocco, Egypt and Lebanon); the Ministry of Local \nAdministration/Government (Palestine); the Ministry \nof the Environment (Jordan); and the regional and local \noffices of the Ministry of Environmental Protection \n(Israel). As highlighted by the EEA and UNEP/MAP \n(2014), laws, strategies or master plans have already \nbeen developed in all MED South countries. However, \nthe progress of these policies is being hindered by \nthe lack of appropriate infrastructure developments \nand the necessary resources, as well as of clearly \ndefined roles and responsibilities, or links to strategic \nobjectives (UNEP, 2016). Local authorities are generally \nresponsible for MSW management, with the growing \ninvolvement of the private sector in treatment and \ndisposal (Morocco, Lebanon, and in the main cities of \nEgypt \u2014 see Box 3.8), landfill has landfill gas recovery \n(Jordan), or both (Tunisia; EEA and UNEP/MAP, 2014). \nSome countries have invested in improving waste \nmanagement, such as Morocco, which launched an \nMSW National Programme worth USD 4.1 billion \n(Ministry of Energy, Mining and Environment, 2020), \nand Jordan, which has implemented waste tariffs to \nfinance MSW management. However, the effectiveness \nof these measures is limited by the low willingness \nand ability of citizens to pay, and by competition in \nthe informal sector that is threatening the commercial \nviability of public-private partnership contracts such as \nin Lebanon (UNEP, 2016).\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n60 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nA\nlg\n\ner\nia\n\nEg\nyp\n\nt\n\nIs\nra\n\nel\n\nJo\nrd\n\nan\n\nLe\nba\n\nno\nn\n\nLi\nby\n\na\n\nM\nor\n\noc\nco\n\nPa\nle\n\nst\nin\n\ne\n\nTu\nni\n\nsi\na\n\nA\nlb\n\nan\nia\n\nBo\nsn\n\nia\n a\n\nnd\n  \n\nH\ner\n\nze\ngo\n\nvi\nna\n\nM\non\n\nte\nne\n\ngr\no\n\nTu\nrk\n\ney\n\nMarine Litter \nand Waste \nManagement \nFramework\n\nNational assessment \nfor marine litter and \nits impacts\n\nYES NO YES NO NO NO NO NO\n\nNational plan or \nstrategy for marine \nlitter\n\nYES YES NO NO NO NO NO NO\n\nNational plan or \nstrategy for waste \nmanagement\n\nYES YES YES YES YES YES NO YES\n\nNational law on waste YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES\n\nNational plan or target \nto close dump sites \nbefore 2030\n\nYES NO YES YES YES NO NO YES\n\nNational information \nsystem for waste \nmanagement in place\n\nYES YES YES NO NO NO NO\n\nResource \nrecovery\n\nNational plan or \nstrategy for waste \nprevention\n\nNO YES YES NO YES NO NO\n\nMandatory targets for \nrecycling \u2014 recovery \nof packaging waste\n\nYES NO YES NO NO NO YES\n\nEPR or deposit-refund \nschemes for packaging \nwaste\n\nYES YES YES NO YES NO NO\n\nNational policies to \neliminate or reduce \nsingle-use plastics\n\nNO YES YES NO YES NO NO\n\nFinancial incentives \nfor reuse \u2014 \nresource-recovery \nactivities\n\nYES YES YES NO YES NO NO\n\nSustainable \nconsumption \nand \nproduction\n\nSustainable \nconsumption and \nproduction plans or \nstrategies\n\nYES YES YES YES NO NO\n\nGreen procurement \nrules for the public \nsector in place\n\nYES NO YES NO NO NO\n\nPolicies to support \nsustainable tourism\n\nYES YES YES YES NO YES\n\nPolicies to support \neco-labelling and \neco-design\n\nYES NO NO YES YES YES\n\nTable 3.13  Waste management laws and policies in MED South countries, MED Balkans and Turkey\n\nSource:  H2020 National Reports (2020).\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n61Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nBox 3.8  Waste legislation and management in Egypt\n\nLegal and institutional framework.

In Egypt, some governorates, including Cairo, have a special department \nfor waste management that runs all relevant stages of waste management. In other governorates, representing the vast \nmajority, the local administration department is in charge of waste-management processes alongside other administrative \nduties.\n\nWaste management at the national level. Established in 2015, the Waste Management Regulatory Authority (WMRA, \nhttps://www.wmra.gov.eg/en-us/Pages/default.aspx) aims to improve the management of waste at the national level. \nIts\u00a0main\u00a0objectives include: (1) provide technical support to public awareness and societal commitment programmes; (2) \nconduct technical studies and propose mechanisms to determine tariffs on integrated waste management services; (3) \ndevelop key performance indicators for monitoring, follow-up and evaluating waste management activities; (4) regulate and \ndetermine the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in waste management systems; (5) regulate, follow and oversee all \nwaste management processes at both the central and local level in a way that improves environmentally safe management; \n(6) strengthen the relationship between Egypt and other states and international organisations in the area of waste; (7) \nrecommend the legal actions necessary to be taken for accession to the international and Mediterranean conventions on \nwaste; and (8) attract and promote investment in the collection, transport, treatment and safe disposal of waste. \n\nIn parallel, in 2012, the Ministry of Environment launched the National Solid Waste Management Programme (NSWMP,  \nhttps://nswmp.net) which aims to restructure the waste sector at the national, regional and local level, setting up an \nindependent central entity to regulate the management of the MSW system, and establishing waste management units in four \ngovernorates (Kafr El Sheikh, Gharbia, Quena and Assiut), with a view to extending the coverage to all other governorates.\n\nCurrent challenges of waste management in Egypt:\n\n\u2014 Multiple laws regulating waste management;\n\n\u2014 Failure to define the responsibilities of different stakeholders in the framework of existing laws;\n\n\u2014 Inability of current laws to enforce and legalise payment of the service cost;\n\n\u2014 Dispersal of sector's assets and lands;\n\n\u2014 Weak and irregular financing of the sector (investment cost or operating cost);\n\n\u2014 Insufficient government subsidies and fees for the integrated solid waste management sector;\n\n\u2014 No independent budget allocated for the system, leading to inconsistent system provision; \n\n\u2014 Fees collected through electricity bills are subject to the clearance of electricity dues on the governorate. \n\nSource:  Egypt SEIS national team. \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n62 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nCountry Type of \nwaste \naddressed\n\nBrief description\n\nAlbania Plastic \ncontainers\n\nThe Law on the Tax System No. 8977/2002 introduced a tax on plastic containers for liquids, such \nas bottles and cans, for both locally produced and imported products. This fee is levied at the \ncontainer production stage. The rates are:\n\n\u2022 1 lek (EUR 0.07) per container up to and including 1.5 litres;\n\n\u2022 2 leks (EUR 0.14) for larger containers.\n\nAlso, according to this Law, importers and manufacturers of plastic packaging are obliged to \npay the national tax on plastic packaging. This tax applies to all plastic products when they are \nimported separately, and when plastic material is at least 51\u00a0% of the volume of overall packaging. \nThe Law distinguishes two rates:\n\n\u2022 100 leks/kg for imported products (collected by the General Directorate of Customs at the \nmoment of import);\n\n\u2022 50 leks/kg for the domestic recycling industry.\n\nFor plastic packaging produced inside the country, the tax is paid when the product is sold with \na\u00a0tax receipt. Every month, a producer who uses plastic packaging should declare its stock of goods \nthat falls under this regulation to the tax administration; otherwise, the tax should be paid on all \nitems sold by the producer in the month concerned regardless of the quantity of goods which \nwould actually have been subject to this tax.\n\nEgypt Plastic bags Ban on the use of plastic bags in Hurghada.

The law does not \napply to isotherm, garbage and industrial- or agrarian-use bags.\n\nImpact: 421 tonnes of plastic bags were seized in one year. Citizens have switched to fabric bags. \nThe Moroccan government declared that plastic bags are virtually no longer used in the country \n(Morocco seizes bags, 2017).\n\nPlastic \nproducts\n\nPlastic Ecotax: in 2014 a new tax came into effect, introduced by the Finances Law 2013, which \ntaxed all plastic products (source materials and final products equally) with 1.5\u00a0% of the total value \nto encourage plastic recycling.\n\nTunisia Plastic bags 2017: ban on the production, importation and distribution of single-use plastic bags in major \nsupermarkets and a levy on consumers for the use of thicker ones (>50 \u03bc).\n\nSingle-use plastic bags and plastic bags of unknown origin have been forbidden since 1 March \n2020 in commercial spaces and pharmacies, and from 1 January 2021, they will be prohibited for \nproducers and suppliers.\n\nIsrael Plastic bags 2017: ban on bags <20 \u03bc and levy on thicker ones in supermarkets (around NIS 0.03) \n(Udasin,\u00a02016).\n\nImpact: a survey revealed that, four months after the law came into effect, 42\u00a0% of shoppers had \nnot bought any plastic bags from supermarkets (Raz-Chaimovich, 2017).\n\nTurkey Plastic bags 2019: charge for plastic bags, with the aim of reducing their use to 90 bags per person per year \nby\u00a031 December 2019, and to 40 bags per person per year by 2025.\n\nTable 3.14  Examples of national legislation adopted in Mediterranean countries to tackle marine litter \ncomprising critical plastic items\n\nSource:  Elaborated by the authors.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n63Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nAlthough almost all the MED South countries have \npolicies that dictate how waste should be managed, \nthere are several factors that constrain the waste \nmanagement system, such as missing or weak \nlegislation and enforcement; low public awareness \nand negative attitudes; and political instability and \nconflicts. These may create a favourable environment \nfor organised crime engaging in illegal transboundary \nmovements of waste, competition with the informal \nsector, and financial constraints (UNEP, 2016).\n\nSeveral countries in the MED South and MED Balkans \nand Turkey are beginning to put in place policies to \nprevent plastic waste and marine litter, as shown \nin Table 3.14 and in Box 3.9. Discussions are being \nheld between governments and industry on possible \nfurther bans on other single-use plastic products, \nsuch as polyethylene terephthalate beverage bottles, \nand food-service industry products such as plastic \ncups, containers, utensils and straws. In Turkey, \nthe 'Zero Waste Regulation', introduced in 2009 by \nthe Environmental Law no. 2872, aims to establish \nand develop a 'zero waste management system' to \nprotect the environment and human health through \na 'zero waste management system' and 'zero waste \ncertifications'. This includes waste prevention and \nreduction measures, dedicated training, and data \ncollection via a 'zero waste information system' created \nby the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization. In \nparallel, comprehensive action plans to tackle marine \nlitter are being prepared in all of Turkey's 28 coastal \nprovinces.\n\n3.1.5 Regional policies and international conventions\n\nAt the Mediterranean level, waste management is \nrecognised as a priority area in the LBS Protocol of the \nBarcelona Convention, the SAP-MED, and the NAPs \ndeveloped and implemented by the Mediterranean \ncountries. When setting priorities for the preparation of \naction plans, programmes, and measures for eliminating \npollution from land-based sources and activities, the \nfollowing waste-related sectors of activity are primarily \nconsidered in the LBS Protocol: (1) management of MSW; \n(2) the waste management industry; and (3) incineration \nof waste and management of its residues. In addition, \nthe Regional Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption \nand Production in the Mediterranean, adopted in \n2016, aims to engage Mediterranean countries in a \nshift towards sustainable consumption and production \npatterns and to establish a circular approach to the \neconomy, including the promotion of new paradigms on \nthe use of resources.\n\nFinally, international efforts to address marine litter at \nthe Mediterranean level are built around the Barcelona \nConvention and its Regional Plan on Marine Litter \nManagement (RPMLM). The adoption of the RPMLM \nin 2013 made the Mediterranean the first regional sea \ncommitted to legally binding measures, programmes \nand related implementation timetables on marine litter \nmanagement at the Mediterranean and national level, \nthereby contributing to the Honolulu Commitment \nand the Rio+20 marine litter targets. The major \nobjectives of the RPMLM are to achieve GES in the \n\nBox 3.9  Reducing plastic bag consumption in Egypt\n\nA partnership between the Ministry of Environment, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the Centre for \nEnvironment and Development for the Arab Regions and Europe (CEDARE) was launched in June 2017 within the framework \nof the SwitchMed Regional Programme, funded by the European Commission. This initiative aims to encourage Egyptians \nto reduce their consumption of plastic bags and to shift towards more environment-friendly alternatives, in cooperation \nwith large fast-moving consumer goods chains, hypermarkets, pharmacies, and other key players, via influential awareness \ncampaigns and diverse activities. Policy options and measures are recommended to reduce the consumption of single-use \nnon-biodegradable plastic bags and promote alternatives in Egypt. \n\nThe target is the reduction of the consumption of single-use, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bags which are \nlightweight and are less than 15-50 microns thick, normally used to carry goods and provided free of charge to consumers. \nThey are single-use in the sense that they are usually used for one shopping trip, although they are often reused in the \nhousehold for other purposes. \n\nA series of consultation workshops took place between May and August 2017 to incorporate the perspectives of key \nstakeholders \u2014 mainly retailers, plastic-bag manufacturers, importers of raw materials, representatives from government, \ncivil\u00a0society organisations, and the media. Further actions to improve legislation on plastics are expected in the near future.\n\nSource:  Bayo et al., 2018.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n64 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nMediterranean through the prevention and reduction \nof marine litter and by limiting its environmental, health \nand socio-economic impacts to a minimum. Most of \nthe measures envisaged in the plan aim to improve \nsolid waste management, implement innovative tools \nrelated to sustainable production and consumption, \nuse economic incentives, and remove existing \nmarine\u00a0litter\u00a0and eliminate hot spots. In this respect, \nthe UNEP/MAP MED POL programme is mandated to \nundertake the assessment of marine litter every six \n\nyears at the Mediterranean level, as well as to coordinate \nthe formulation and implementation of a marinelitter monitoring programme based on an ecosystem \napproach used by all Mediterranean countries. \nIn\u00a0this respect, the Regional Cooperation Platform on \nMarine Litter in the Mediterranean was established in \nSeptember 2016 with the aim of providing coordinated \nsupport and guidance to implementation of the RPMLM. \nIn addition, the platform acts as a forum for consultation, \nexchange of good practice, and seeking solutions.\n\nNote:  Status as per 1 March 2020; abbreviations: S (signature), R (ratification), A (accession), AA (approval), \u2014 (not applicable).\n\nSource:  Elaborated by the authors.\n\nTable 3.15  Participation of Mediterranean countries in international waste-related conventions \n\nCountry Basel \nConvention\n\n(15)\n\nStockholm \nConvention\n\n(16)\n\nRotterdam \nConvention\n\n(17)\n\nMinamata \nConvention\n\n(18)\n\nBamako \nConvention\n\n(19)\n\nLondon \nConvention \n\n(1972) \n(20)\n\nLondon \nProtocol \n\n(1996)\u00a0\n(21)\n\nMARPOL \n73/78 \n\nAnnex V \n(22)\n\nAlbania A R A S \u2013 A\n\nAlgeria A R A\n\nBosnia and \nHerzegovina\n\nA R A \u2013\n\nCroatia A R A R \u2013 R R\n\nCyprus R A R R \u2013 R R\n\nEgypt A R  R R R\n\nFrance AA AA AA R \u2013 R R R\n\nGreece R R R S \u2013 R R\n\nIsrael R S R S R\n\nItaly R S R S \u2013 R R R\n\nJordan AA R A R \u2013 R R\n\nLebanon R R A A \u2013 R\n\nLibya A A A S R R R\n\nMalta A R A R \u2013 R R\n\nMontenegro A R A R \u2013 R R\n\nMorocco A R A S R R R\n\nSlovenia A R R R \u2013 R R R\n\nSpain R R R S \u2013 R R R\n\nSyria R R R R \u2013 R R\n\nTunisia A R R S R R R\n\nTurkey R R R S \u2013 R\n\n(15)  Basel Convention (1989) on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.\n(16) Stockholm Convention (2001) for the protection of human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs).\n(17)  Rotterdam Convention (1998) to promote shared responsibilities in relation to the import of hazardous chemicals.\n(18)  Minamata Convention (2013) to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of\u00a0mercury\u00a0and \n\nmercury compounds.\n(19)  Bamako Convention (1991) prohibiting the import of any hazardous (including radioactive) waste in Africa.\n(20)  London Convention (1972) on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, as modified by the London Protocol \n\n(1996).\n(21)  London Protocol (1996) to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972.\n(22)  Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL \n\n73/78) on the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n65Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nIn general, Mediterranean countries participate in \ninternational efforts to prevent and manage waste. \nThis is testified by their high level of involvement in the \ninternational conventions in place, which target specific \naspects of waste management. Table 3.15 summarises \nthe status of Mediterranean countries' accession to \nthese conventions.\n\n3.1.6 Critical assessment of existing data and \nknowledge\n\nMunicipal solid waste data \n\nAccording to the work programme for the second \nphase of the Horizon 2020 Initiative for a Cleaner \nMediterranean (2015-2020), 'the main challenge for \nthe second phase (period 2014-2020) is to ensure the \nsystemic production and sharing of quality assessed \ndata, indicators and information relevant to Horizon \n2020, providing consistency between the effectiveness \nof measures implemented under the Barcelona \nConvention with what is effectively available to build \nup a full assessment on the state of the Mediterranean \nSea'. It adds that 'the second challenge is to enhance \nthe country ownership of the H2020 Monitoring and \nReview process (not only from RM representatives \nbut from all partners), ensuring sustainability of the \ngovernance structure and an integrated coordination'. \n\nThese challenges were experienced during the \npreparation of the section on waste management in \nthe MED South countries. As data were not available \nfor several countries, the regional assessment activities \nfor waste in the MED South region could not effectively \nuse the sparse responses to H2020 waste indicators. \nThis is reflected in this report, which relied on already \npublished information produced during the first phase \nof the project (2007-2013) and on other documents \npublished by the UNEP, the World Bank, and other \ninternational bodies. This problem was acknowledged \nby UNEP in the GEO6 (UNEP, 2016) which highlighted \nhow waste management data for Western Asia \ncountries are poor and often not up to date, and the \ninfrastructure is limited, thereby hindering effective \nwaste management and control. \n\nIn Egypt, indicators have been one of the main \nvehicles used to portray environmental conditions, \nprogress made, and support decision-makers and \nother stakeholders with information and analysis. \nThe\u00a0Environment Law (Law No. 4, 1994) clearly \n\nidentifies the role of indicators in supporting \nenvironmental regulations, and the need to abide \nby such indicators to maintain a safe and sound \nenvironment (Article\u00a05, Environment Law, 1994). \nIn\u00a0addition, the recently published State of Environment \nReport (2017) clearly indicates the role of Law No.\u00a04 \nin drawing the general policy and guidelines that \nmaintain Egypt's environmental integrity and the role \nof indicators in this domain. Accordingly, the report \nproduced by the Egyptian Ministry of Environment, \njointly with the National Solid Waste Management \nProgram (NSWMP) in 2013 (23), identifies the lack of \nsound indicators for waste management, especially \nthose related to recycling, as one of the main hurdles to \nproper solid waste management in Egypt. However, the \nindicators used in Egypt by the Ministry of Environment, \nand that found in the literature, are limited in number \nand differ from those suggested by the H2020 \nframework. This has created a gap between the regular \nset of indicators used in Egyptian literature and the \nnewly introduced set. This is the case, for example, for \nplastic-waste generation per capita (indicator 1.B) which \nis not included in the set of indicators in Egypt, possibly \nbecause of national authorities' recent interest in the \nproblem of marine litter.\n\nAnother example relates to information needed for the \nH2020 requirements, which is hard to validate, such \nas in the case of the number of uncontrolled dump \nsites for which it is difficult to obtain reliable figures. \nOther information is available but not accessible, \nsuch as data for the number of tourists in coastal \nareas (indicator 1.D). Very often, although information \nregarding the population and other issues is available \nin some departments, it is not easily accessible. Finally, \nalthough the Ministry of Environment is responsible for \npresenting the indicator sets, most of them \u2014 or the \ninformation needed to produce them \u2014 originate from \nother public authorities. The outcome is that several \nindicators for the H2020 framework are unavailable \n(Annex F) (UNEP/MAP, 2019e).\n\nTo resolve the situation, the accessibility of the \ndata in the hands of the Central Authority for Public \nMobilization and Statistics should be improved by \nremoving the existing logistic hurdles. Moreover, the \nskills of the personnel working in the field of marine \nlitter must be improved (H2020 Report for Egypt, 2020).\n\nIn Jordan (24), data are generally available, although in \nsome cases there is no quality assurance and control. \nThe following data gaps have been identified: lack \n\n(23)  https://www.eeaa.gov.eg/portals/0/eeaaReports/NSWMP/1_P0122721_NSWMP_Main%20Report_December2011.pdf\n(24)  Extracts from a presentation by Jordan at 10th meeting of the Horizon 2020 Review and Monitoring Group, 23-24 September 2019 in Athens, \n\nGreece.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n66 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nof standard definitions and classifications for some \nwaste; measurements taken at disposal sites, waste \ncomposition figures changed due to formal and \ninformal recycling practices; lack of measurements \nand standard methodologies for measurement; lack \nof standard reporting systems; inaccurate reporting \nof waste collected by the Greater Amman Area, Joint \nService Council, and municipalities; role of illegally \nand randomly burned quantities of waste; and the \nfact that the recycling markets are not well structured \nand the relevant data is not systematically aggregated \nand reported on at the national level (H2020 National \nReport for Jordan, 2020). A new strategy for MSW \nmanagement for the period 2017-2030 has been \nlaunched, with the support of the EU. The real-time \nmonitoring of waste quantity is currently in place, \nthrough Wellbridge from landfills to the national \nmonitoring information system at the Ministry of \nEnvironment. As a result, 40 indicators have been set \nup covering all SEIS indicators for waste.\n\nMarine litter data\n\nThe issue of marine litter and the related information \non the amounts and types in the Mediterranean \nis complex as, in most countries, it is addressed \nprincipally by scientific institutions and subregional \nand local authorities, and by competent NGOs, which \nprovide valuable information on the volume and types \nof litter in the Mediterranean (Wilson et al., 2015).\n\nIn order to assess the impact of waste on the marine \nlitter issue in the Mediterranean and Mediterranean \ncountries' responses to the issue, several previous \nstudies were evaluated to fill the data gap on marine \nlitter. However, with the exception of data on total \npopulation and number of tourists arriving, available in \nthe 'World Bank Development Indicators' dataset, most \nof the available data are either prior to 2014 or are not \nof the required quality. Although the Mediterranean \n\ncountries demonstrated a high willingness to monitor \nand manage marine litter, regular monitoring activities \nare lacking in the region. Most of the available data on \nmarine litter originated from available scientific studies \nwith limited coverage. Consequently, the available \nknowledge on marine litter remains limited, inconsistent \nand fragmented. Under these circumstances, it has not \nbeen possible to analyse progress since 2014 in terms of \nthe state of the indicators for marine litter. As a result, \npreparations for the current report have relied mainly \non published information, produced during the first \nphase of the ENI-SEIS project (2007-2013) and on several \navailable scientific and technical reports, activity reports \nand projects.\n\n3.2 Water \n\n3.2.1 Water assessment \u2014 key messages\n\n\u2022 Access to safely managed sanitation systems \n(SMSS) has increased in the region but efforts \nin the MED South subregion are not sufficient \nto keep up with population growth. More than \n158 million inhabitants in the MED South region do \nnot have access to SMSS. However, the absolute \npopulation without access to SMSS has been on the \nrise since 2003, in line with the significant increase \nin the overall population. The gap in access to SMSS \nbetween urban and rural populations continues \nto close but still requires attention. In MED EU \ncountries and MED Balkans and Turkey, a decline \ncan be seen in the absolute population without \naccess to SMSS. \n\n\u2022 Collection and treatment of municipal \nwastewater is generally on the rise, as is \nwastewater generated as a result of the steady \nincrease in population in the region.

However, in some MED South countries, \nmost of the wastewater generated is discharged \nuntreated into the Mediterranean. The current \npolitical crisis and instability in Lebanon, Libya and \nSyria have either resulted in the shutting down of \nwastewater treatment plants or the suspension of \nconstructing new ones. The volume of wastewater \ndischarged untreated into the environment, \nstreams, wadis or directly into the sea (estimated to \nbe around 5 km3/yr) still requires attention.\n\n\u2022 The level of treatment has improved \nsignificantly, in particular in the MED EU, but \ntertiary treatment is lagging behind in three \nsubregions. Wastewater treatment is also an issue \nin some MED EU countries where full compliance \nwith the UWWTD Directive remains a challenge.  \n\n\u2022 Water reuse is on the rise, with a few countries \nmaking significant advances driven by a higher \ndemand for water and lower water availability. \nIn Israel, Jordan and Tunisia > 96\u00a0% of wastewater \ncollected is treated. These countries promote \nwastewater treatment and reuse as an integral part \nof their water management strategy. Within the \nbroader scope of the regional plan for municipal \nwastewater, quality standards for effluents, \nwastewater reuse and nature-based solutions to \nwastewater management will be addressed. This \nwill provide the right legislative framework for water \nreuse and its more holistic assessment in the future.\n\n\u2022 The contribution of urban wastewater treatment \nplants (UWWTPs) to nitrogen discharges is as high \nas 90\u00a0%, with the remaining 10\u00a0% attributed to \nindustrial discharges. Although the Mediterranean \nSea is generally oligotrophic and eutrophication is \nnot an issue at the basin scale, nutrient enrichment \nmay occur in sheltered coastal waterbodies, such as \nharbours and semi-enclosed areas subject to nutrient \ninputs from, for example, urban effluents and \nindustrial discharges. In situ data availability should \nbe improved in order to conduct a trend analysis of \nthe key nutrient concentrations at eutrophication \nhot spots, which are well documented. Although \nthe use of the Copernicus Marine Environment \n\nMonitoring Service (CMEMS) satellite and modelled \ndata products for the purpose of policy-relevant \nassessments is promising, it comes with a series of \nchallenges. \n\n\u2022 Bathing water quality is improving in the region \nwith the MED EU countries exceeding the EU \naverage, and monitoring in some MED South \ncountries showing clear progress. However, \nMED EU countries are among those with the \nbest and worst bathing water quality in Europe. \nDespite a general improvement, with most sites \nbeing classified as sufficient/good or excellent, and \nupward trends in countries that have reported \nunder H2020, sites of poor bathing water quality, \ndue to pollution from domestic and industrial \neffluents, still require attention.\n\n\u2022 Significant gaps in data, for example, on \nwastewater, especially in large MED South \ncountries (Algeria, Egypt, Libya) are hampering \na\u00a0full regional assessment.\n\n3.2.2. Why does water continue to be a priority issue \nin\u00a0the Mediterranean region?\n\nIn the second phase of the Horizon 2020 programme \n(2015-2020), it was agreed to broaden the water area \nto inland, coastal and marine water. The aim was to \nachieve a more holistic assessment of the water issue \nin the region characterised by two challenging facets \n\u2014 limited water quantity (water scarcity (25)) and the \ndegradation of water quality. Although traditionally \nwater quantity and quality have been considered as \nseparate issues, the strong interactions between the \ntwo are now better recognised  through the concept of \nthe water quantity-quality nexus (Gunda et al.,\u00a02019). \nIn some arid areas, water scarcity is seen as the root \ncause of many other water challenges, including \naccess to safe drinking water, as well as water quality \nissues\u00a0(26). These challenges are predicted to intensify \nwith the changing climate, increasing water demands, \nand a growing concern over the degradation of water \nquality and related aquatic ecosystems. A case in point \nthat illustrates the strong link between water quality \nand quantity is wastewater treatment and reuse in \nresponse to water scarcity. Although a full assessment \nof water quantity in the Mediterranean falls outside the \nscope of the H2020 Initiative, characterisation of the \navailable water resources across the Mediterranean \nregion is required to put the issue of water pollution \ninto perspective. More detailed information on water \n\n(25)  Water scarcity can be defined as <1000 m3/inhabitants/year and absolute water scarcity as < 500 m3/inhabitants/year.\n(26)  https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/10/28/can-we-have-our-water-and-drink-it-too-exploring-the-water-quality-quantity-nexus/\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n68 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\navailability and on the effect of climate change on \nwater resources in the region can be found is available \n(MedECC, 2019; UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020).\n\nThe Mediterranean region is characterised by an \nextremely unbalanced distribution of water resources, \nranging from 25 000 m3/inhabitant/yr in Croatia to as \nlittle as 120 m3/inhabitant/yr in Malta (Figure 3.14). All \nMED South countries face water scarcity as the result of \n\nlimited and sporadic precipitation, among which Algeria, \nIsrael, Jordan, Libya, Palestine and Tunisia face absolute \nwater scarcity. Nearly all Mediterranean countries \nhave experienced a drop in the total renewable water \nresources per capita over the past 15 years (2002-2017), \nthe most significant being in the MED South countries, \nnotably Jordan (45.5\u00a0%) and Lebanon (42.1\u00a0%). A positive \ntrend is observed in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nCroatia and Greece (FAO, 2016).\n\nFigure 3.14 Total renewable water resources per capita in Mediterranean countries (m3/inhab/yr)\n\nNote:  Up to Tunisia \u2014 absolute water scarce; Up to Lebanon \u2014 water scarce.

With the MED South \ncountries positioned among the most water scarce in \nthe world, water continues to be a key priority for the \ndevelopment of the Mediterranean region.\n\nWhen countries consume more water than they \ncan sustain, the result is water stress. Progress \ntowards SDG 6.4 'to ensure sustainable withdrawals \nand supply of freshwater to address water scarcity' is \ncaptured by SDG indicator 6.4.2: 'Level of water stress: \nfreshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available \nfreshwater resources'. This indicator tracks the volume \nof freshwater withdrawn by all economic activities, \ncompared to the total renewable freshwater resources \navailable (UN Water, 2020a). Most Mediterranean \ncountries experience water stress higher than the \n\nsustainable threshold of 25\u00a0%, with many, in particular \nMED South countries, exceeding 70\u00a0%. Figure 3.15 \ngives an overview of SDG indicator 6.4.2, showing the \nincrease (orange arrow to the right) or decrease (blue \narrow to the left) in the percentage of water stress \non renewable water resources. For MED South, the \nwater stress levels in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia \nand Libya have been increasing for the past 15 years \n(Figure 3.15, shown by orange arrows), some of \nwhich now exceed 100\u00a0%, implying that more than \n100\u00a0% of available renewable freshwater resources \nare being withdrawn. This deficit in the extraction of \nsufficient renewable water sources is compensated by \nnon-renewable sources, putting additional pressure on \naquatic ecosystems. Water scarcity and water stress will \nbe exacerbated as climate change and rapidly growing \nurbanisation place significant pressures on water \nresources, amplifying the already complex relationship \nbetween socio-economic development and water \ndemand.\n\nNote:  Value of water stress after considering the water needed for sustaining the natural environment.

In Israel, this can be explained \nby the installation of desalination plants since 1997, \naccounting for roughly 30\u00a0% of their total water \nconsumption. In addition, the country has taken several \nmeasures to reduce freshwater withdrawal, such as \nthe regulation of water extraction from the Sea of \nGalilee and aquifers, promoting the reuse of water \nfor irrigation and the introduction of drip irrigation \nin agriculture (Legislative Council Commission, 2017). \nIn response to the decline in freshwater resources, \nMorocco has made several efforts to enhance water \nsecurity, such as centralising wastewater treatment \nin 2009 and constructing 43 additional wastewater \ntreatment plants, investing in desalination in coastal \nareas, and subsidising drip irrigation for agriculture \n(Kurtze et al., 2015).\n\n3.2.3 A 'source\u2011to\u2011sea' approach to the water \nthematic\u00a0area\n\nThe adopted source-to-sea approach provides an \nintegrated way to evaluate the progress in this \nthematic area across the land-sea continuum, starting \nfrom the upstream pressures related to access to \nsanitation, wastewater management and downstream \nstate/impacts in terms of coastal and marine water \nquality. As shown in Figure 3.16, the selected H2020 \nwater indicators are intended to assess the progress \nin the water thematic area along the source-to-sea \ncontinuum, covering most components of the \nDPSIR framework. The achievement of sustainable \ndevelopment should balance the needs and demands \nalong the source-to-sea continuum, from satisfying \nthe upstream equitable uses of water to safeguarding \nthe downstream water quality and ecosystems \n(Berggren and Liss Lymer, 2016). For the water area, \nthe source-to-sea approach presents a paradigm that \nrecognises the need to address marine pollution from \nland-based sources and to manage freshwater and \ncoastal pollution issues in a holistic way, in line with \nthe ecosystem approach. It goes beyond the more \nestablished IWRM concept that brings together water \nstakeholders dealing with various aspects, such as \ndrinking water, energy production, agriculture, and \nother industries, by extending the scope to coastal and \nmarine areas. To this effect, in the second phase of \nthe Horizon 2020 programme (2015-2020), the water \narea was extended to cover inland, coastal and marine \nwaters in line with the IMF which links IWRM with ICZM, \nEcAp and DPSIR.\n\n3.2.4 Key water trends\n\nAccess to safely managed sanitation systems \n\nManagement of safe water sources and proper \nsanitation are crucial for sustainable development, \nand particularly important to the water-scarce \nMediterranean region. Lack of sanitation poses \nhealth risks from contaminated drinking water \nto life-threatening forms of diarrhoea to infants, \nparticularly for poorer segments of the population \nwho\u00a0are most exposed to inadequate human waste \ndisposal. \n\nMoving from the MDG to the SDG sanitation indicator\n\nThe H2020 indicator on sanitation (IND 3.2) was \nrevised to align it with the corresponding indicator \nSDG 6.2.1: Proportion of population using safely \nmanaged sanitation services (SMSS), including \na\u00a0hand-washing facility with soap and water. \nAs\u00a0compared to the sanitation indicator under the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDG Indicator\u00a07.9: \nPopulation using improved sanitation systems \n\u2014\u00a0ISS,\u00a0equivalent to IND 3.1 ), SDG 6.2.1 goes further \nby addressing public health beyond the household \nlevel, including containment and treatment of fecal \nwaste (Table\u00a03.17). SMSS is the highest level defined \naccording to the sanitation ladder, with the addition \nof: (1) facilities not being shared by households; (2) \nexcreta are either safely disposed in situ; or (3) excreta \nare treated off-site (GEMI, 2016). The higher standard \nof the SDG sanitation indicator relative to the MDG \nindicator (Table 3.17) implies that values for access to \nSMSS (SDG 6.2.1) are generally lower than ISS (MDG \n7.9) which was used in the first H2020 Mediterranean \nassessment (EEA and UNEP/MAP, 2014). \n\nRegional trends in access to sanitation \n\nA positive trend in populations with access to SMSS \n(top-right, dark-green fraction in Table 3.17) has been \nobserved in all three Mediterranean subregions over \nthe last 20 years (Figure 3.17). The total population \nwith access to SMSS increased from 278\u00a0million \nin 2003 to 343 million in 2017. However, at the \nregional\u00a0level, the population without access to \n\nUpdated H2020 water indicators\n\n\u2022 IND 3.1 Share of total, urban and rural population \nwith access to an improved sanitation system (ISS)\n\n\u2022 IND 3.2 Proportion of population using safely \nmanaged sanitation services (SMSS)\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n72 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nSMSS\u00a0(27) is also increasing \u2014 from 146 million in 2003 \nto 158\u00a0million in 2017. In 2017, 158 million people \nin the Mediterranean region still had no access to \nSMSS, 111\u00a0million of whom lived in the MED South \n(excluding Syria), 33 million in MED Balkans and \nTurkey, and 15\u00a0million in the MED EU subregion. In \nthe MED Balkans and Turkey, the population without \naccess to SMSS has been on the decline since 2003, \ndespite population growth. The equivalent population \nin the MED EU has remained constant at around \n15\u00a0million inhabitants (Figure 3.17). In the MED South \ncountries, however, the population without access \n\nto\u00a0SMSS has been increasing steadily since 2003 \n(Figure\u00a03.17). This can be partly explained by the \nconcurrent population growth (Figure 3.18).

Since 2003, the proportion of the overall \npopulation with access to SMSS has increased for the \nMED South subregion by 6\u00a0%. However, in 2017, only \nhalf of the MED South population had access to SMSS. \nSome countries are exceptions, such as Israel where \naccess to SMSS has been reported at 100\u00a0% in urban \nareas and steadily rising in rural areas since 1970. \nThese findings imply that with some country-based \nexceptions, the level of responses showing access to \nSMSS in the MED South subregion is not yet able to \nkeep up with the concurrent increase in population. \nDespite the relative increase in the proportion of the \npopulation with access to SMSS and a decline in the \nleast-safe sanitation types, there is still a need for \ncontinuous investment to supply SMSS to the growing \npopulation. A more detailed analysis of the sanitation \nservices in the MED South shows that differences \nbetween urban and rural sanitation service levels \nremain prominent, with access to SMSS in rural areas \n\nlagging behind. More than 5.7 million people living in \nurban areas and no less than 10.6 million rural dwellers \nwere deprived of access to at least basic sanitation in \n2017, and had to revert to limited, unimproved and \nopen defecation. The comparison with corresponding \ndata for previous years shows that there has been \na much stronger decline in the number of people \nwithout access to at least basic sanitation in rural \nareas (16.4\u00a0million to 11.4 million in 2003 and 2017, \nrespectively) than in urban areas (~ 6.6 million in both \n2003 and 2017). This implies that the gap between \nurban and rural coverage has been gradually narrowing \nover the period from 2003 to 2017 (Figure 3.19).\n\nAlthough there is progress in some countries, \ncomprehensive information in responses referring to \ninvestment in improving sanitation services for the \nMED South subregion is difficult to find. Some countries \nprovide information through different policy channels. \nFor instance, according to the Egyptian Voluntary \nNational Report, 80 sanitation projects have been \ncompleted over four years, covering 414 villages and \ncosting EGP 9 billion (EUR 0.5 billion). The target is to \nachieve full provision of sanitation services in all villages \nby 2030 through the implementation of a sanitation \nprojects plan in the remaining underserviced villages \n(2\u00a0800 villages, or 58\u00a0% of the total) for an estimated \ntotal cost of EGP 200 billion (EUR 11.24 billion). \n\nFigure 3.19  Urban and rural populations in the MED South subregion with access to different types of \nsanitation service (million inhabitants)\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n2003 2011 2017 2003 2011 2017\n\n0\n\n2003 2011 2017\n\nSafely managed\n\n(At least) basic\n\nLimited\n\nUnimproved\n\nOpen defecation\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nUrban without access to at least basic\n\nRural without access to at least basic\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n5\n\n15\n\nTotal urban and rural without access to at least basic \n\nPopulation \n(million inhabitants)\n\nMED South urban MED South rural MED South urban and rural \nwithout at least basic sanitation\n\nNote:  'Without access to at least basic sanitation' is the sum of limited, unimproved and open defecation.

The analysis \nfor the total official development assistance for water \n\nsupply and sanitation (SDG 6.a.1) data and total \npopulation using SMSS (SDG 6.2.1) in the MED South \ncountries gives rise to an interesting relatively linear \ncorrelation until 2012, before 'slowing down' in recent \nyears (2014-2017) despite relatively large investments \n(Figure 3.20). \n\nFigure 3.20  Correlation analysis of SDG 6.a.1 and SDG 6.2.1 between 2003 and 2017\n\n0\n\n120\n\nPopulation using SMSS (million inhabitants)\n\nCumulative official development assistance for water supply and sanitation\nfor MED South subregion (constant million USD 2017) between 2003-2017\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n0 2 000 4 000 6 000 8 000 10 000 12 000\n\n2003\n2004\n\n2005\n2006\n\n2007\n2008\n\n2009\n2010\n\n2011\n2012\n\n2013\n2014\n\n2015\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote:  SDG 6.a.1: Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending \nplan; SDG 6.2.1: Population using SMSS, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water.

The polluting effect of wastewater \ndischarge is variable and largely dependent on the \ninitial composition, quantity, level of treatment of the \ncollected wastewater, composition of the effluent, and \nthe capacity of the receiving water bodies. Appropriate \ncollection and treatment of municipal wastewater not \nonly prevents human health issues and pollution of \naquatic environments but also has a large potential and \nbenefits in the overall management of water resources. \nIn a context of climate change and increased pressure \non water availability, treated wastewater is an asset as \nit helps to close the gap between supply and increasing \ndemand and is one of the most sustainable alternatives \n\nUpdated H2020 water indicators\n\n\u2022 IND 4.1 Municipal wastewater collected and \nwastewater treated\n\n\u2022 IND 4.2 Direct use of treated municipal wastewater\n\n\u2022 IND 4.3 Release of nutrients from municipal \nwastewater\n\nto cope with water scarcity. In this assessment, only \npoint sources and their related infrastructure, including \nWWTPs and outfalls, are considered. Issues linked to \ndiffuse effluents from agriculture are not addressed.\n\nThe wastewater management chain\n\nFor an analytical assessment of progress in wastewater \nmanagement in the Mediterranean, the following \nstages have been identified in the wastewater \nmanagement chain: wastewater generation, collection, \ntreatment, and reuse (Figure 3.21). The wastewater \nmanagement chain starts with the generation of \nwastewater either by municipalities or industries. Not \nall wastewater generated is collected \u2014 some may \nbe disposed of directly without treatment. Municipal \nwastewater collected on behalf of a municipality \nis generally treated in municipal WWTPs. In the \nMediterranean, the most prevalent type of wastewater \nreaching the treatment plants comprises a mixture \nof municipal wastewater (residential settlements \nand services predominantly for human metabolism \nand household activities), storm water and industrial \nwastewater. \n\nWastewater is subject to different levels of treatment, \nranging from the lower standard levels (primary \n\nBox 3.10  Case study on Tunisia: progress in access to sanitation and development of the policy support system \n(PSS) for SDG 6 \n\nTunisia has made significant progress in providing access to sanitation, resulting in over 4 million people having access to \nimproved sanitation between 1990-2015. Sanitation services fall under the Office National d'Assainissement (ONAS) which \nis responsible for both municipalities and rural areas with over 4 000 inhabitants. Rural areas (30\u00a0% of the population, most \nof whom are in coastal areas) fall under the responsibility of rural councils which often lack the resources for improving \nsanitation services. There have been several ad hoc initiatives and programmes targeting sanitation in rural areas, such as \nthe PNAQP programme (1989-2019, funded by the French Development Agency) which aimed to improve sanitation of rural \nareas in 1 234 districts and included a sanitation pilot project in 15 rural communities (Tunisia NAP). Rural sanitation still \nrequires prioritisation in terms of investments, laws and implementation (World Bank, 2018).\n\nTo make further progress towards achieving SDG 6, Tunisia has worked together with the Republic of Korea, Ghana, Tunisia, \nPakistan and Costa Rica (2016-2018) in the project 'Water in the World We Want' to develop the SDG 6 Policy Support System \n(SDG-PSS). This tool provides a 'fit-for-policy' evidence framework for collaborative planning to develop and implement \nwater-related policies for strengthening the enabling environment for achieving SDG 6. In Tunisia, the SDG-PSS was officially \nadopted for reporting on the SDG 6 and dissemination of the system at the regional and local level for the improved quality \nand reliability of data. \n\nA workshop on using SDG-PSS to support countries in Africa and the Middle East on water-related sustainable development \nwas held in Tunisia in 2019. From the MED South countries, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco were present as participating \ncountries in the region. The project partners moved to the second phase of the project in 2019 with the aim of extending \nthe use of SDG-PSS to other UN member states in different regions of the world. Due to its active role in promoting the \nengagement of more countries in the region, Tunisia is acting as the regional hub during the second phase. \n\nSource:  https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=30176\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n77Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\ntreatment) to higher standard levels (tertiary \ntreatment). In some cases, collected wastewater is not \ntreated according to standards due to the non-optimal \nfunctioning of the WWTPs. Treated wastewater is either \ndisposed of in the environment or reused. Volumes of \nwastewater collection and treatment, including per type \nof treatment and direct reuse, are covered in the H2020 \nindicator list (Figure 3.16). Where available, data on \nmunicipal wastewater generation are also considered \nto complete the wastewater management chain. \n\nWastewater generation, collection and treatment\n\nRegional status and trends \n\nFigure 3.22 shows a comparison between wastewater \ngenerated and treated before and after 2012 based \non available data for each subregion. The AQUASTAT \ndatabase provides data on wastewater generated and \ntreated for nearly all countries with near-complete \ncoverage for before 2012 (FAO, 2016). Data from \nthis database were used to complement the data \ndelivered by countries under H2020, in order to get \na\u00a0full overview of the region when data were missing. \nWhile wastewater collected is usually a fraction of the \n\nwastewater generated, in the absence of a complete \nregional dataset on wastewater collection, the \nwastewater generated is shown. \n\nThe MED EU is responsible for the largest volume of \nwastewater generated in the region, followed by MED \nSouth, even though the population of MED South \ncountries has exceeded that of the MED EU subregion \nsince 2000 (see Section B). Based on data before 2012, \nthe MED EU also treats the largest percentage of its \nmunicipal wastewater (96\u00a0% before 2012), followed by \nMED Balkans and Turkey (78\u00a0% and 83\u00a0% before and \nafter 2012, respectively) and MED South (59\u00a0% and 63\u00a0% \nbefore and after 2012, respectively). While data for \nthe MED EU was insufficient to complete the overview \nafter 2012, the subregion is not expected to have \nexperienced a decline in the proportion of treatment. \nMED Balkans and Turkey and MED South subregions \nregistered an increase in the relative treatment of \ngenerated wastewater of 6\u00a0%, yet treatment in these \nsubregions is still lagging behind the MED EU.\n\nSDG indicator 6.3.1a (29) monitors the proportion of \ndomestic wastewater flow safely treated (%).

The data overview \nfor 'before 2012' is almost complete; the dataset for \n'after 2012' is missing more recent data for volumes of \nwastewater collected in Algeria and Egypt and overall \nupdated data for Lebanon (Figure 3.24). The analysis of \nthe wastewater management chain at the subregional \nlevel is mainly dominated by values for Egypt.\n\nBased on the available data for before and after 2012, \nthe volume of wastewater generated has increased as \na result of population growth (Figure 3.24). The volume \nof wastewater collected has also increased (despite \nmissing updated data for Algeria, Egypt and Lebanon) \nbut, in relative terms, the proportion of wastewater \ncollected declines after 2012. While investments strive \nto keep up with the increase in population, wastewater \n\ncollection has improved significantly since 2012 at the \nsubregion level. The proportion of wastewater treated \nas a percentage of the wastewater collected shows a \nslight increase (from 61\u00a0% to 68\u00a0%), pointing towards \nprogress in treatment efficiency and quality. In absolute \nterms, the volume of wastewater directly reused has \nincreased. \n\nTime-series data delivered by countries (Israel, \nJordan, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia) under the \nH2020 reporting mechanism (Figure 3.25) provide \na\u00a0better understanding of the progress in wastewater \nmanagement in MED South countries. Data show \na steady increase in both volumes of wastewater \ncollected and treated, reflecting the investments in \nnew or rehabilitated wastewater infrastructure and \nthe increase in the number of WWTPs (not shown). \nIn some countries, such as Israel, Jordan and Tunisia, \nup to >96\u00a0% of wastewater collected is treated. \nThese countries promote wastewater treatment and \nreuse as an integral part of their water-management \nstrategy. For Israel, Jordan and Tunisia, the volume \nof wastewater collected and treated per capita \nremains roughly stable over time indicating that \nthe increase in coverage is in line with the increase \nin population.

Only 68\u00a0% of the wastewater collected \nis treated in centralised or decentralised wastewater \ntreatment plants. Since most wastewater generated \nis not collected, the fraction of wastewater treated \namounts to a mere 25\u00a0% of that generated. However, \nthe volume of wastewater collected (and to some \nextent treated) is increasing faster than the concurrent \npopulation increase (Figure 3.25), indicating an absolute \nimprovement in wastewater management and a larger \nfraction of the population being served by wastewater \ninfrastructure.  \n\nWastewater, and specifically the prevention of \nenvironmental and marine pollution, has been \na\u00a0priority in Morocco since 2006 when the Wastewater \nTreatment and Purification Program (PNA) was \nlaunched. Under this support programme, several \nWWTPs have been developed over the years. Of the \n111.36 Mm3 of wastewater collected in the coastal \nhydrological basins of Morocco draining into the \nMediterranean, 103.11 Mm3 is treated in WWTPs, \nrepresenting 93\u00a0%. Morocco has a relatively large \nmarine outfall of wastewater in the Mediterranean \n(73.17 Mm3/year), which is released pretreated \n(Morocco SEIS, 2020). Currently, Morocco is planning \nto install an additional eight municipal WWTPs and to \nextend two existing WWTPs in the period of 2019-2021 \n(Morocco SEIS, 2020). With this development, the \ncountry will make a shift towards more tertiary \ntreatment of wastewater (Figure 3.25) in addition \nto increasing the total yearly treatment capacity by \n16\u00a0000\u00a0m3/year.\n\nWhen it comes to treatment type, a shift towards \ntertiary treatment is observed over time for all \nreporting countries. In Israel, the tertiary treatment \nfraction has increased over the years reaching \n55\u00a0%\u00a0in 2017 (Figure 3.25). In recent years, Jordan \nand Tunisia have moved towards more advanced \nlevels of treatment, and now only have secondary and \ntertiary treatment levels. However, the progression \ntowards further tertiary treatment is developing slowly. \nPalestine has introduced tertiary treatment over the \n\nlast five years which, however, still accounts for a very \nsmall fraction (1\u00a0%) of the treatment type (Figure 3.25).\n\nFocus on the MED EU and MED Balkans and Turkey  \n\nThe EEA indicator on urban wastewater treatment \n(CSI 024) measures the percentage of the population \nconnected to sewage collection systems, as well as the \nprevalence of primary, secondary and tertiary UWWTPs \n(EEA, 2017). The amount of urban wastewater treated \nis expressed as population equivalents (p.e.). This \nindicator, available for the MED EU and MED Balkans \nand Turkey, shows a marked improvement in urban \nwastewater treatment in all parts of Europe (EU plus \nthe UK) over recent decades as the direct result of the \nimplementation of the UWWTD (91/271/EEC; EU, 1991) \nin Europe. \n\nThe average treatment level in the MED EU and \nMED Balkans and Turkey has improved over the last \n10\u00a0years (2005-2015) (Figure 3.26). Despite an overall \nimprovement of roughly 15\u00a0% in connections between \n2005 and 2015, the proportion of the population \nconnected to urban wastewater treatment in the MED \nEU (around 70\u00a0%) and MED Balkans and Turkey (53\u00a0%) \nis generally lower than the whole EU average (80\u00a0%) \n(Figure 3.26). A marked decrease in collection without \ntreatment can be observed in the MED EU between \n2005 and 2012 with a concurrent increase in tertiary \ntreatment, which nevertheless still requires attention.\n\nImproved wastewater management generates social, \nenvironmental and economic benefits for moving \ntowards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \n(UN, 2015). Several challenges are hampering \nprogress on wastewater management around the \nMediterranean. In the MED South subregion, the \nfinancial and institutional capacities to operate and \nmaintain infrastructure that can adequately serve the \ngrowing population remain a challenge. The MED EU \nsubregion faces other challenges, such as improving \nresource and energy efficiency, ensuring the effective \nremoval of emerging pollutants, and achieving full \ncompliance with European legislation (EEA, 2019b). \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n82 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nWastewater disposal and reuse\n\nThe final stage of the wastewater management chain \nconcerns the disposal of wastewater (treated or \nuntreated), or reuse. \n\nDischarge of untreated wastewater\n\nDischarge of untreated wastewater into the \nenvironment still occurs around the Mediterranean, \nin\u00a0particular in certain countries in the MED South and \nMED Balkans and Turkey. The efficiency of wastewater \ntreatment in the Mediterranean region is highly \nvariable. In some areas where wastewater treatment \nplants do not have the capacity to accommodate the \nlarge volumes of wastewater resulting from growing \nurban populations, retention times for wastewater \ntreatment have become too short to be effective \n(Qadir et al., 2010). Consequently, untreated or \n\ninsufficiently treated wastewater is discharged into \nopen wadis, valleys, rivers, streams or directly into the \nsea. This presents risks for both human health and the \nenvironment.\n\nBased on the data collected (Annex C), the \nvolume of\u00a0untreated wastewater discharged into \nenvironment\u00a0(31) by MED South countries was \nestimated\u00a0to be ~5 km3/yr, ranging between 5.15 \nand 5.20 km3/yr before and after 2012 and roughly \nequivalent to half of the amount of wastewater \ngenerated. Despite continuous efforts and investment \nin the region to improve wastewater management, \nthe political, financial and institutional crisis faced \nby certain countries, notably Lebanon, Libya and \nSyria, has hit the wastewater sector hard. In these \ncountries, several WWTPs are out of operation \nand the\u00a0construction of new WWTPs has been \ndiscontinued. \n\nNote:  MED EU includes Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Slovenia and Spain; MED Balkans and Turkey includes Albania, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and Turkey; EU includes EU-27 plus the UK.\n\n The initial stage for the treatment of wastewater is connection to sewage-collection systems. Wastewater can then be subjected to \nprimary treatment, such as settling, followed by secondary treatment to reduce the amount of dissolved and suspended organic \nmaterial. Secondary treatments include those using biological methods. More stringent 'tertiary' treatment can then be applied to \nremove mainly nutrients.\n\nSource:   EEA (2017) based on Eurostat 2017.\n\n0\n\n100\n\nPopulation (%)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nMED Balkans and TurkeyMED EUEU\n\n2005\n2012\n\n2015\n2005\n\n2012\n2015\n\n2005\n2012\n\n2015\n\nCollected without treatment Primary treatment Secondary treatment Tertiary treatment\n\nFigure 3.26  Average percentage of population connected to public wastewater collection and treatment \nsystems in MED EU and MED Balkans andTurkey in comparison to EU (2005, 2012, 2015)\n\n(31)  Assumed as the difference between wastewater generated and treated.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n83Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nIn Lebanon, only 16 out of 50 WWTPs are classified \nas operational, serving just 308 000 residents out of \na population of ~6 million. This implies that 99.95\u00a0% \nof the population still discharges its wastewater \nwithout treatment (Lebanon NBB, 2019). Beside \nthe institutional and financial challenges facing the \noperation and maintenance of existing wastewater \nnetworks and treatment plants, the lack of wastewater \nmanagement has been further exacerbated by the \nimpact of displaced Syrians (Lebanon, 2018). In Syria, \nall preliminary domestic WWTPs are down and out \nof operation as a result of the current political crisis, \nwhich is also preventing the completion of a number \nof other plants (e.g. Jableh, Ras al Basit, Banias, and Al \nHamidieh). Other infrastructure projects \u2014 for example, \ntwo sewage treatment plants designed to perform \nsecondary treatment with mechanical sludge treatment \nin the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus \u2014 have been \ntemporarily suspended due to the difficulty of importing \nthe necessary equipment (Syria NBB, 2019). Wastewater \nis either discharged directly/indirectly into the sea or \npassed through wastewater collection ponds considered \nas primitive and preliminary WWTPs. These ponds do \nnot function properly and need improvements to make \nthem operational until full WWTPs have been completed \n(Syria NBB, 2019). A similar situation can be seen in \nLibya, where around 99\u00a0% of the wastewater generated \n(~487\u00a0Mm3/yr in 2017) is discharged untreated into the \nsea every year (Libya NBB, 2019). In Palestine, especially \nin the Gaza Strip, the discharge of untreated wastewater \ninto open wadis or directly into the sea is common \npractice (H2020 National Report for Palestine, 2020). \nIndustrial wastewater generated from local industries \nis also discharged through the sewer network or open \nwadis and, in most cases, is mixed with the municipal \nwastewater. Besides implications for the aquatic \necosystems, the discharge of raw wastewater into the \nenvironment poses a serious human health hazard due \nto the contamination of drinking-water sources and the \ngreater risk of contact with pathogens. For instance, \nabout 26\u00a0% of all diseases in the Gaza Strip are mainly \nconnected to contaminated drinking water and 75\u00a0% \nof all Gaza beaches, the main destination for internal \ntourism, are not fit for bathing due to the deterioration \nin coastal and marine water quality (National Water \nAssessment, 2019). The construction of more WWTPs is \nin the pipeline, while others are at the design stage but \nlack the necessary funding.\n\nWastewater reuse: from waste to resource\n\nIn response to higher demands for water and lower \nwater availability, the region is gradually moving \ntowards non-conventional water resources to help \n\noffset the water deficit, including the expansion of \ndesalination and the reuse of treated wastewater. \nWhen it comes to wastewater reuse, a distinction is \nmade between direct and indirect reuse. Direct reuse \nrefers to treated wastewater that is directly reused, \nfor example, in agriculture. Indirect reuse concerns \ntreated wastewater that is first diluted by releasing it \ninto natural waters (disposal of treated wastewater) \nand later used as a water source. Since most treated \nwastewater ends up in natural water bodies, reuse \nusually refers to direct reuse. Treated wastewater can \nbe reused for various purposes, including the creation \nof green belts, energy generation, fodder production \nfor livestock, and irrigation for fruit trees or other cash \ncrops. Proper treatment of wastewater prior to use \nis crucial for public safety, to prevent the spread of \nwaterborne diseases. In the past, unauthorised reuse \nof untreated wastewater for irrigation has been the \nmain source of cholera outbreaks in Mediterranean \ncountries (Choukr-Allah et al., 2012 ).\n\nTo prevent improper reuse, quality requirements \nhave been established in many countries. The recently \nproposed regional plan on municipal wastewater \ntreatment (Decision IG.24/10) as an update/extension \nof the current regional plan of BOD5 from urban \nwastewater will also address aspects of the reuse of \ntreated municipal wastewater in agriculture, including \nnutrient reclamation, the reuse/recycle of treated \nwastewater, for example, through aquifer recharge, \nin response to regional water scarcity and setting the \nappropriate quality standards for different water (re)\nuses. Progress is also being made towards establishing \na legal instrument on water reuse in Europe. Following \nthe work on establishing a common approach \nregarding quality standards for water reuse, specifically \nfor agriculture and aquifer recharge (Alcade-Sanz and \nGawlik, 2017), a proposal on 'minimum requirements \nfor water reuse' has been published (EC, 2018b) and a \nWater Reuse Regulation was adopted in May 2020 (32). \nThe aim is to support the transition to a more circular \neconomy  by increasing the efficiency of reuse of water \nresources and safeguarding Europe's water resources \n(EC, 2012).\n\nRegional status and trends\n\nBased on the available data, an increasing trend overall \nin the direct reuse of wastewater over time in the \nMediterranean region as a whole (excluding Syria) can \nbe seen (Figure 3.27). There is significant uncertainty \nconcerning the reliability of data on wastewater reuse, \nand contradictory country data were found in different \nsources.

Syria had a particularly large volume \nof direct reuse of wastewater prior to 2013-2019, \ncontributing strongly to the reused fraction in the MED \nSouth. This explains the observed drop in the volume \nof direct reuse of wastewater in the MED South in \n2013-2019, for which data for Syria is not available. \nData for the MED Balkans and Turkey subregion is \nunavailable, except for Turkey. Bosnia and Herzegovina \nreported the volume of direct reuse as 0.\n\nFocus on the MED South\n\nWith the exception of a few countries, such as Israel, \nJordan and Tunisia which rely heavily on wastewater \nreuse as a non-conventional source of water, the \nuptake of wastewater reuse in the MED South \nsubregion has been slow and uneven despite the MED \nSouth being among the most arid and water-scarce \nregions in the world. In general, an increase in the \nproportion of directly reused wastewater since 2012 \nis\u00a0observed in most countries (Table 3.18).  \n\nNote:  This overview is based on data delivered by MED South \ncountries under H2020 reporting, supplemented by the \nAQUASTAT database (FAO, 2016) (see Annex C).

This increase is specifically in \ntertiary treated wastewater. Over 90\u00a0% of reuse is for \nagriculture irrigation. In Jordan, the reuse of reclaimed \nwastewater, particularly domestic wastewater, is of \ngreat importance. The proportion of direct reuse is \naround 17-18\u00a0%. The national water strategy for Jordan \nhas been updated to control and manage the use of all \nwater resources according to environmental and public \nhealth regulations. The emphasis is on encouraging \nthe (direct and indirect) reuse of treated wastewater, \nparticularly in the Jordan Valley, as a major resource \nfor agriculture. This is the largest consumer in Jordan, \nwhere around of 51\u00a0% of the total water budget is \nallocated for irrigation. In Tunisia, ~17\u00a0% of treated \nwastewater was reused in 2017, indicating an increase \nof 6\u00a0% since 2012. The largest volumes of reuse \nare indirect and are intended for aquifer recharge. \nTunisia introduced a national reuse programme in \nthe 1980s. The focus has been on valorisation of \ntreated wastewater reuse as a strategic choice in \nresponse to the impacts of climate change. Despite \ngovernment support, most farmers prefer groundwater \nirrigation over reused wastewater due to higher social \nacceptance. Time-series data for Palestine show that \ndirect reuse was stepped up from less than 1\u00a0% in 2011 \nto a staggering 14\u00a0% in 2017. In Jordan, Palestine and \nTunisia, most reused wastewater undergoes secondary \ntreatment.\n\nMorocco has also experienced an increase in water \nreuse, with reuse targeted mainly at agriculture and \nwatering green spaces, and to a lesser extent industry. \nThe estimated direct reuse fraction in the two coastal \nhydrological basins draining into the Mediterranean \nSea increased from 0\u00a0% in 2010 to 48.1\u00a0% in 2019, \ncompared to 12.9\u00a0% at the national level (Table 3.18). \nWater reuse in Morocco has been encouraged by \nseveral initiatives, including the adoption of a Water \nLaw which incorporates specific provisions for the \nreuse of wastewater; publication of quality standards \nfor water intended for irrigation; and a master plan for \nthe reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation, targeting \nan increase in reuse (direct or indirect) at 325\u00a0Mm3/year \nby 2030 (Morocco SEIS, 2020). \n\nIn Algeria, direct reuse increased by 7\u00a0% from 2011 to \n2017, and is expected to continue increasing (Algeria \nNAP, 2016).

In absolute terms, France and Spain are the main \ncontributors (Figure 3.29). Water reuse in Spain has \nbeen included in legal systems since the 1985 water \nlaw, enabling an increase in safe wastewater reuse over \ntime, specifically in agriculture (45\u00a0%) and irrigation of \nparks and recreational areas (36\u00a0%) (Jodar-Abellan et al., \n2019). In terms of percentage, Cyprus and Malta are the \nmost advanced in reuse, with 90\u00a0% and 60\u00a0% of their \ntreated wastewater reused, respectively. This is much \nhigher than the European average of 2.4\u00a0% reported \nby Mudgal et al. (2015). Some countries are projected \nto have a large potential for wastewater reuse based \non the capacity of their WWTPs (e.g.\u00a0France, Greece, \n\nNote:  Total direct reuse for Israel include the fraction that goes back to nature\n\nSource:  H2020 reporting.\n\nFigure 3.28  Volume of direct wastewater reuse per treatment level in selected MED South countries\n\nTertiary treatmentPrimary treatment Secondary treatment Total wastewater treated Total direct wastewater reused\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n2003\n2004\n\n2005\n2006\n\n2007\n2008\n\n2009\n2010\n\n2011\n2012\n\n2013\n2014\n\n2015\n2016\n\n2017\n\n0\n\n600\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n0\n\n600\n\nVolume of wastewater reused \nper treatment level (mm3/year)\n\nIsrael\n\n0\n\n35 180\n\n0\n\nVolume of wastewater reused \nper treatment level (mm3/year)\n\nJordan\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\nVolume wastewater\n(mm3/year)\n\nVolume wastewater\n(mm3/year)\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n0\n\n14 100\n\n0\n\nVolume of wastewater reused \nper treatment level (mm3/year)\n\nPalestine\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nVolume wastewater\n(mm3/year)\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n0\n\n50 300\n\n0\n\nVolume of wastewater reused \nper treatment level (mm3/year)\n\nVolume wastewater\n(mm3/year)\n\nTunisia\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nSource:  Computation based on FAO-AQUASTAT (2016).\n\nFigure 3.29  Volume of direct wastewater reuse in \nthe MED EU subregion (Mm3/year)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1 000\n\n0\n\n1 200\n\nDirect wastewater reuse (mm3/year)\n\n2003-2007 2008-2012 2013-2019\n\nGreeceCyprus France Italy Malta Spain\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n87Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nItaly and Spain). However, according to national \nexperts from France, Greece and Italy, no large \nincrease in reuse should be expected due to the high \nadministrative burden and complexity associated with \nthe application of standards (Mudgal et al., 2015). \n\nRelease of nutrients from municipal wastewater \n\nThe disposal of treated or untreated wastewater \ncan be an important source of nutrients and organic \nsubstances in aquatic bodies, directly impacting water \nquality. High nutrient loads entering the Mediterranean \nfrom point sources, such as municipal treatment \nplants or sewage outfalls, can lead to eutrophication \nevents in an otherwise nutrient-poor sea (see Section \nCoastal and marine quality). Industrial activities, such \nas power-generation plants, food and beverages, textile \nmanufacturing, and the production of pulp and paper \nare another important source of nutrients depending \non whether or not the releases are transferred to the \ncollection system (see Section Industrial emissions). \nAlthough most point sources are land-based, others \ncan be sea-based, such as aquaculture. Loads of \nnutrients from diffuse sources, such as agriculture, \natmospheric deposition and mobile sources like \nshipping, are not included in the current assessment \nalthough their contribution is commensurate with point \nsources (e.g. Malag\u00f3 et al., 2019).\n\nThe main substances to indicate nutrient enrichment \nare often BOD, total nitrogen (TN) and total \nphosphorous (TP), linking the release of nutrients from \nmunicipal wastewater to the concentrations in coastal \nand marine areas. A comparison of BOD, TN and TP \nfrom UWWTPs and other industries in Mediterranean \ncoastal hydrological basins is provided in Figure 3.30. \nThis overview is compiled from national baseline \nbudget (NBB) reporting as part of the LBS Protocol \nby countries in the MED South and MED Balkans and \nTurkey, and E-PRTR reporting by MED EU countries (for \nmore information, see section on Industrial emissions). \nThe complete dataset used can be found in Annex C.\n\nNutrient (TN and TP) loads from wastewater treatment \nplants are generally higher than from other industries, \nin particular in the MED EU subregion where TN and \nTP loads from wastewater treatment plants amount to \n90\u00a0% of total loads. This is in line with the conclusions \ndrawn from the country industrial profiles discussed \nunder the thematic assessment on industrial emissions \n(see section on Industrial emissions for more detail). \nHowever, in the MED South subregion, TP loads \nfrom other industries are higher, probably related to \nphosphate-mining activities in certain countries. \n\nFrom the regional perspective, discharges of nutrient \nloads from WWTPs are regulated by a set of measures \n\nWastewater treatment Other industries\n\n100 000\n\n200 000\n\n300 000\n\n400 000\n\n500 000\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans\nand Turkey\n\n0\n\n600 000\n\nBOD loads (tonnes/year)\n\n10 000\n\n20 000\n\n30 000\n\n40 000\n\n50 000\n\n60 000\n\n70 000\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans\nand Turkey\n\n0\n\n80 000\n\nTN loads (tonnes/year)\n\n1 000\n\n2 000\n\n3 000\n\n4 000\n\n5 000\n\n6 000\n\n7 000\n\n8 000\n\n9 000\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans\nand Turkey\n\n0\n\n10 000\n\n TP loads (tonnes/year)\n\nNote:  Data for the MED South and MED Balkans and Turkey are from NBB 2018 reporting; data for the MED EU are from 2017 E-PRTR V17, \nfollowing extraction of data for Mediterranean coastal river basin districs (RBDs).

A mid-term evaluation of the \nexisting regional plan (WG.473/14; UNEP/MAP, 2019) \nwas carried out in 2019, which included a review of the \nstatus of implementation of measures and an analysis \nof the trends of discharges/releases. The evaluation \nindicated that the measures have yet to be fully \nimplemented by all the Contracting Parties. Although \nmost countries have met the deadlines for setting \nthe ELVs for urban wastewater, around half have \nyet to consolidate formal authorisation, monitoring \nand reporting systems. Monitoring and reporting of \ndischarges from municipal WWTPs are implemented in \nmost MED EU countries, as well as Turkey, prompted \nby the enforcement of the UWWTD adopted in \n1991. Although consolidation of the monitoring and \nreporting plans in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \nEgypt and Montenegro in currently under way, in other \ncountries, for example, Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco \nand Tunisia, there is no evidence of the presence of \nsound monitoring systems. The status of wastewater \ntreatment is primarily related to a country's economic \nsituation, with advanced programmes found in the MED \nEU region compared to the MED South region. Analysis \nof reported data on releases from WWTPs as part \nof\u00a0the\u00a0mid-term evaluation (UNEP/MED WG.473/14; \nUNEP/MAP, 2019) did not lead to conclusive trends. \n\nApart from the new regional plan on municipal \nwastewater treatment, five new/updated pollution \nreduction regional plans are currently being \ndeveloped, mandated by the COP20 (Tirana, Albania, \nDecember 2017) and adopted by COP21 (Naples, Italy, \nDecember 2019). These include regional plans for the \nmanagement of sewage sludge and urban storm-water \nmanagement; nutrient management from agriculture \nand aquaculture; and updating the regional plan on \nmarine litter. The main elements of the proposed \nregional plan on municipal wastewater treatment \ninclude, among others, ELVs for BOD, chemical oxygen \ndemand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), TN, TP and \nother priority substances/emerging contaminants, \nbased on sensitivity of the recipient environment, the \napplication of BATs and BEPs, including energy saving \nor renewable/alternative energy sources for operating \nWWTPs and the promotion of solutions adapted to \nsmall agglomerations, such as NBS (e.g. constructed \nwetlands) (see Box 2.4). Other aspects related to \nwastewater management will be covered by the \nregional plan on sewage sludge from municipal WWTPs \n(Decision IG.24/10; UNEP/MAP, 2019).\n\nThe recent evaluation of the European UWWTD \n(EC,\u00a02019c), with the aim of assessing whether the \n\nDirective is still fit for purpose 30 years after its \nadoption, showed that it has been highly effective in \nreducing loads of BOD, TN and TP from urban point \nsources (domestic/urban wastewater and similar \nindustrial pollution). Modelling results show that, \nbetween 1990 (around the year when the Directive \nwas adopted) and 2014, across the EU, BOD, nitrogen \n(N) and phosphorus (P) loads in treated wastewater \nfell by 61\u00a0%, 32\u00a0% and 44\u00a0%, respectively, clearly \ncontributing to the improved quality of EU water bodies \nand ensuring the safety of EU bathing-water sites. \nFurther\u00a0reductions can be expected once the Directive \nhas been fully implemented. \n\nCoastal and marine water quality \n\nWater quality in transitional and coastal regions can \nbe adversely affected by anthropogenic activities, such \nas the discharge of urban and industrial untreated \nwastewater, and diffuse sources such as agricultural \nand animal waste run-off, and the atmospheric \ndeposition of airborne emissions from shipping and \ncombustion processes. Although diffuse sources are \nnot part of this assessment, understanding their trends \ncould greatly boost progress in achieving GES in the \nMediterranean Sea. The status of coastal and marine \nwaters provides insight into the downstream part of the \nsource-to-sea continuum affected by nutrient pollution \npressures both in the coastal hydrological basin and \non the coast. Water quality is thus not only important \nfrom an environmental perspective but also from \na\u00a0socio-economic one, considering that coastal tourism \nis a key economic activity in the Mediterranean region. \n\nNutrient concentrations \n\nHigher nutrient concentrations (TN and TP) can lead \nto eutrophication and increased phytoplankton \nproduction. Nutrient enrichment and eutrophication \nhave negative ecological impacts, such as potentially \nharmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion, \naffecting benthic communities and fish. The clear \nand transparent Mediterranean waters are the \nresult of the oligotrophic nature of the basin which \nis characterised by low nutrient concentrations and \nlow primary production and phytoplankton biomass. \nAlthough eutrophication is not an issue at the basin \n\nUpdated H2020 water indicators\n\n\u2022 IND 5.1 Nutrient concentrations in transitional, \ncoastal and marine waters\n\n\u2022 IND 5.2 Bathing water quality\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n89Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nscale, it may commonly occur in sheltered marine \nwater bodies, such as harbours and semi-enclosed \nareas subject to nutrient inputs from, for example, \nurban effluents, industrial discharges, and aquaculture \nactivities as well as transboundary components, such \nas agricultural run-offs, riverine outflows, and airborne \nnutrient deposition. The Mediterranean's main coastal \nareas, historically known to be influenced by natural \nand/or anthropogenic inputs of nutrients, are the \nAlboran Sea, the Gulf of Lion, the Gulf of Gab\u00e8s, the \nAdriatic, Northern Aegean and the SE Mediterranean \n(Nile-Levantine) (UNEP/MAP, 2017a). According to the \n2017 Mediterranean Quality Status Report, nutrient \nconcentrations in areas with available data were in \nline\u00a0with characteristic values for coastal regions \n(UNEP/MAP, 2017a). In a recent assessment of nutrient \nenrichment and eutrophication in European seas \n(EEA, 2019b) through the application of the HEAT+ (33) \ntool, several coastal areas near the Mediterranean's \nlargest cities were classified as eutrophication problem \nareas. However, both studies concluded that a full \nassessment of nutrient enrichment at the scale of \nthe Mediterranean Basin was not possible due to the \navailability of insufficient data \u2014 both spatial and \ntemporal \u2014 and a lack of science-based threshold \nvalues (EEA, 2019c; UNEP/MAP, 2017a). \n\nIn the absence of available and accessible data with \nappropriate spatial and temporal coverage (with \nthe exception of Tunisia which reported nutrient \nconcentrations under H2020), the use of CMEMS \nproducts based on satellite and model results was \ninvestigated using the ODYSSEA platform (34). \n\nUsing chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration as a proxy \nfor eutrophication and for hot spots of inorganic \nnutrient inputs, the maximum monthly concentration \nof Chl a in the 2003, 2012 and 2017 was retrieved \nbased on CMEMS satellite products (35) (Map 3.2). The \ndistributions of Chl a confirm that the Mediterranean \nBasin is largely oligotrophic in the centre, with a Chl \na\u00a0gradient from west to east. The recognised hot \nspots in the Alboran Sea, Gulf of Lion, Gulf of Gab\u00e8s, \nAdriatic, Northern Aegean and the SE Mediterranean \n(Nile-Levantine) are clearly shown.\n\nThe potential use of CMEMS data products was further \ninvestigated by looking into nutrient concentrations \nbetween 2003-2017 in three hot spots: the outfall of \n\nthe River Po in the Northern Adriatic, the outfall of \nthe River Nile, and the Gulf of Gab\u00e8s (Map 3.2), using \nthe CMEMS reanalysis product (36). This reanalysis \nmodel for nutrient concentrations considers nutrient \nloads from rivers and other coastal nutrient sources \nbased on the reconstruction of spatial and temporal \nwater discharge variability, estimated according to the \nmethod described by (Ludwig et al., 2009). The aim \nwas not to infer a full eutrophication assessment in \nthese areas but to test the feasibility of using CMEMS \nproducts in future assessments as a way of overcoming \nlimited spatial and temporal nutrient data coverage \nfor the region. Therefore, results showing trends in \nChl\u00a0a\u00a0and nutrients at these locations are not discussed \nbut can be found in Annex C. \n\nAs CMEMS products for Chl a provide full spatial and \ntemporal coverage, they can be used as a proxy to \ndetect incidences of eutrophication and to identify \npotential hot spots for nutrient inputs. However, one \nshortcoming of the reanalysis product is that it does \nnot take into account point sources, such as sewage \noutfalls, and aquaculture sites. Given the arid nature \nof the region, point sources are thought to make \na\u00a0relatively large contribution to overall coastal nutrient \ninputs. A second shortcoming concerns the nutrient \nform. The main H2020 indicator refers to TN and \nTP, with the inorganic nutrient forms of nitrate and \nphosphate among the sub-indicators; the parameters \navailable in the CMEMS catalogue are limited to nitrate \nand phosphate. Analysis of these inorganic forms on \ntheir own is not enough to assess nutrient trends and \ncoastal/marine water-quality issues. For the purpose \nof assessing eutrophication in the Mediterranean Sea, \nconsidering that eutrophication issues occur mainly \nin localised coastal areas, more specific localised data \nproducts that capture the main nutrient sources at the \nright spatial and temporal scale would be more fit for \npurpose than regional products.  \n\nIn line with the conclusions from the QSR (UNEP/\nMAP, 2017a), data should be made more available \nto conduct a trend analysis of the key nutrient \nconcentrations at eutrophication hot spots.

This will significantly help \nthe implementation of a clear sampling strategy with \na simplified approach in monitoring, design and data \nhandling for the future implementation of IMAP, as \nwell as a complete assessment of eutrophication and \nGES achievement. It could also support quantification \nof the required nutrient load reductions through a \nmore accurate determination of the 'distance to target' \n(EEA,\u00a02019c). \n\nBathing water quality\n\nContamination from untreated wastewater degrades \nthe quality of bathing water and poses health risks due \nto increased pathogenic concentrations. Bathing water \nquality is an important indicator for the region. On the \none hand, it reflects the effectiveness of wastewater \nmanagement, and on the other hand, it safeguards \nthe epidemiological safety of Mediterranean beaches \nthat are important for recreation and tourism. \nBathing water quality is measured as the percentage \nof bathing water samples with intestinal enterococci \nconcentrations within established standards, for \nwhich standards and criteria have been adopted in the \nMediterranean (37) (Decision IG.20/9; UNEP/MAP, 2012) \nand which are also in line with the EU New Bathing \nWater Directive (2006/7/EC; EC, 2006).\n\n(37)  IMAP Common Indicator 21: percentage of intestinal enterococci concentration measurements within established standards (EO9).\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n92 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nRegional overview\n\nBathing water quality is systematically and regularly \nreported across Europe and in part in the MED \nBalkans and Turkey. However, analysis of the trend \nin bathing water quality for the whole Mediterranean \nregion is challenged by the lack of centralised and \nregular reporting in the MED South subregion, even \nthough some countries having excellent national \nbathing-water-quality monitoring programmes in \nplace. Other countries, such as Palestine, confirmed \nthat bathing-water-quality data are not available. \nTo\u00a0assess bathing water quality at the regional level, \nfragmented data from different sources were put \ntogether: H2020 reporting, NAPs, WISE data reported \nto the EEA, and reporting under the European Bathing \nWater Directive. Based on available data, a regional \noverview of the percentage of excellent, good or \nsufficient, poor and not classified bathing waters is \nprovided (Figure 3.31). \n\nFocus on the MED South \n\nSignificant gaps in the data limit full subregional \ncoverage for the MED South. However, reporting under \nH2020 shows marked improvements in the bathing \nwater quality in specific countries (Figure 3.32).\n\nSince 2010, Israel has been monitoring intestinal \nenterococci and reporting the percentage of samples \nwith excellent results. As these are authorised public \nbeaches, 14 km of Israel's shoreline are monitored \nfor bathing water quality. When concentrations of \nthe regulated beaches exceed the qualifications for \nexcellent bathing water, bathing is prohibited (Israel \nNAP, 2015). In 2017, a total of 6 030 samples were \ntaken from over 70 regulated beaches, of which the \naverage excellent percentage was 96\u00a0%. As part of \nefforts to combat marine pollution, Tunisia monitors \nbathing water quality through a network of more than \n500 sampling locations, managed by the Ministry of \nHealth. Data for 2018 shows that 55\u00a0% of the beaches \nare of good to very good quality. Particular attention, \nhowever, must be paid to other beaches considered \nunsuitable for bathing (~15\u00a0% classified as bad or very \nbad) (Figure 3.32). Morocco has a national monitoring \nprogramme on bathing water quality and periodically \npublishes a national report on bathing water quality \n(Royaume du Maroc, 2016, 2019). In addition, national \n\nresearch laboratories responsible for pollution \nmonitoring have developed an application called \n'Iplages' which provides directly accessible information \non bathing water quality for 169 Moroccan beaches \nfrom 45 stations. The information on monitored \nbeaches is updated every 15 days (38).\n\nAccording to the 2017 QSR (UNEP/MAP, 2017a), the lack \nof recent datasets on microbiological pollution in the \nMediterranean Sea submitted to the MAP Secretariat \nis the main current gap and concern. Regular reporting \nof data in line with IMAP is required to assess whether \nor not levels of intestinal enterococci comply with \nestablished standards for GES. \n\nFocus on the MED EU and MED Balkans and Turkey  \n\nAnalysis of bathing water quality in the MED EU is \nthorough and complete, thanks to the reporting \nestablished under the European Bathing Water \nDirective and the yearly report on bathing water \nquality published by the EEA. The percentage of \nexcellent bathing water at the MED EU coastal beaches \nhas been steadily increasing over time and has \nsurpassed the EU average (Figure 3.33). Based on the \nEEA bathing water quality assessment (EEA, 2019c), \nthe MED EU countries are among the countries with \nboth the best and the worst bathing water quality in \nEurope. In the following countries, 95\u00a0% or more of \nbathing waters were found to be of excellent quality: \nSlovenia (100\u00a0%\u00a0of\u00a021\u00a0beaches), Cyprus (99.1\u00a0% of \n110 beaches) and Malta (98.9\u00a0% of 86 beaches). At \nthe same time, the three countries with the highest \nnumbers of poor-quality bathing water sites in Europe \nwere Italy (1.7\u00a0% of 4\u00a0754\u00a0beaches), France (1.4\u00a0% of \n1\u00a0992\u00a0beaches) and Spain (0.5\u00a0% of 1 898 beaches) (39).\n\nThe proportion of bathing water sites with excellent \nwater quality vary between 25-69\u00a0% in the MED \nBalkans and Turkey (Figure 3.33). However, no clear \ntrend for this subregion can be deduced because of \ngaps in the data. Most of the Mediterranean beaches \nin Turkey have excellent water quality. The bathing \nwater legislation in Turkey is also harmonised with EU \nDirective 2007/6/EC. In Albania, an improvement in \nbathing and overall water quality has been observed in \nrecent years, associated with the construction of five \nWWTPs which provide wastewater treatment for almost \nhalf a million residents (EEA, 2019c).\n\n(38)  http://www.environnement.gov.ma/images/a_la_une/Publications%20PDF/rapport-national-FR-eaux-de-baignade.pdf\n(39)  2019 data were published too late to be included in this assessment but are available in the latest bathing water quality assessment (EEA, 2020).\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n93Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nNote:  Numbers at the top of each bar represent the number of beaches monitored and year, if other than 2018, in brackets.

This \nassessment was primarily based on data delivered by \nMED South countries as part of the H2020 reporting \nmechanism, supplemented by other national sources \n(e.g. NAPs, NBB) and regional and global databases to \nachieve full regional coverage as far as possible. \n\nData for countries in the MED EU and MED Balkans \nand Turkey were extracted from European datasets \nand databases, such as the EEA indicator on urban \nwastewater treatment, WISE Bathing water quality \ndatabase, E-PRTR, etc. in an effort to achieve full \nregional coverage. In some instances, differences were \nencountered in methodologies, definition of indicators, \nunits, etc. which may give rise to uncertainties and \na\u00a0fragmented analysis. \n\nThe use of data from global databases, specifically data \nfor SDG indicators, raised concerns among some MED \nSouth countries. Countries did not always approve \nof or trust data from global databases, claiming that \n\nthe source of data for international organisations is \nunknown and methodologies differ from national ones. \nFor instance, in the case of access to SMSS (SDG 6.2.1), \ndiscrepancies between national and international data \nfor the same indicator were explained by differences in \nmethodologies pertaining to the consideration of septic \nsystems that are regularly emptied and wastewater \ncollected and transported as SMSS at the national level \nbut only as basic sanitation internationally. Another \nexample is the proportion of wastewater safely treated \nin Greece. According to SDG 6.3.1 data, the proportion \nof wastewater treated in Greece is < 50\u00a0% (Figure 3.23) \nwhereas the corresponding EEA indicator identifies \nGreece as a leader in tertiary treatment (data shown as \npart of the MED EU subregional overview in Figure\u00a03.24). \nIt is important that countries are aware of these \ndiscrepancies and take action to justify or resolve them.\n\nAs for nutrient data, the use of CMEMS satellite and \nmodelled data products was explored to overcome \nthe issue of limited data availability and accessibility. \nAlthough the use of such products for assessments \nis promising, it comes with a series of challenges. \nSuch regional products would need to be tailored \n(parameters, geographical scale, etc.) for policy-relevant \nassessments. \n\nNote:  Date includes MED Balkans (Montenegro (MNE): 2011; Albania (AL): 2013, 2015, 2018; Turkey (TR): 2019 included under 2018), \nMED\u00a0EU\u00a0(2010, 2013, 2015, 2018). \n\nSource:  (EEA, 2019c) and Turkey personal communication. \n\nFigure 3.33  Evolution of the proportion of bathing water sites with excellent water quality in the \nMED\u00a0EU\u00a0and MED Balkans and Turkey between 2010 and 2018 (%)\n\n0\n\n100\n\nBathing water sites with excellent water quality  (%)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nMED Balkans and TurkeyMED EU\n\n2011 (M\nNE)\n\n2013 (A\nL)\n\n2015 (A\nL)\n\n2018 (A\nL &\n\n TR)\n2010\n\n2013\n2015\n\n2018\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n95Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nThe most significant data gaps were encountered \nwhen populating the indicators related to the \nwastewater management chain (volume of wastewater \ngeneration, collection, treated, directly reused). Reliable \ntime-series data for assessing trends of wastewater \ngenerated, collected, treated and reused for the \nwhole Mediterranean region remain a challenge. \nPatchy datasets could be obtained by combining \ndifferent sources, especially for more recent years. \nHowever, this\u00a0led to discrepancies in values for \ncertain parameters, raising questions about data \nquality. The\u00a0lack of wastewater data for Egypt which, \ndue to its size, dominates the subregional overview, \nis a shortcoming in the assessment of progress on \nwastewater management. While efforts have been \nmade in terms of regional data and infrastructure, \nmany challenges remain in terms of harmonising \nand centralising databases, in particular related to \nwastewater data. \n\nIn the framework of H2020, the most appropriate \ngeographical scale for assessing progress on water is \nthe coastal hydrological basin. Despite efforts to focus \non the coastal hydrological basin scale \u2014 for example, \nthe release of nutrients from municipal WWTPs located \nin the coastal hydrological basins; and the assessment \nprepared by Morocco which focuses on the TangerT\u00e9touan-Al Hoceima and l'Oriental regions located \non the Mediterranean coast \u2014 developing sound \nmethodologies for downscaling national data to the \nappropriate scale remains a challenge. \n\nProgress on the development of national water \ninformation systems to support data sharing and \nexchange is assessed in Section B.\n\n3.2.6 Towards more integrated management of \nwater\u00a0resources\n\nAs regards water, there is a clear move from addressing \nwater quality issues per se to integrated water \nresource management. IWRM promotes coordinated \nand inclusive approaches for the development and \nmanagement of resources, in line with SDG 6.5 which \naims to implement IWRM at all levels. SDG 6.5.1 \nindicator tracks the 'Degree of integrated water resources \nmanagement implementation (0-100)' by assessing the \nfour key components of IWRM: enabling environment, \ninstitutions and participation, management instruments, \nand financing (UN Water, 2020b). SDG\u00a0indicator 6.5.1. \nshows that IWRM implementation in the Mediterranean \nregion ranges from medium-low (30-50\u00a0%) to very \nhigh (90-100\u00a0%) (Figure\u00a03.34). MED South countries \nscore from medium-low (30-50\u00a0%; IWRM elements are \ngenerally institutionalised and implementation is under \nway) to medium-high (50-70%; capacity to implement \nIWRM elements is generally adequate and elements \nare generally being implemented under long-term \nprogrammes), with the exception of Israel where the \ndegree of IWRM implementation is high. The range across \nthe Mediterranean shows that, given the importance \nof water management for sustainable development, \nimplementation of IWRM should be accelerated in certain \ncountries. Also, there are opportunities for strengthening \nthe capacities for IWRM implementation in the MED \nSouth and MED Balkans and Turkey subregions through \ncollaboration, knowledge transfer and support from the \nMED EU subregion. The next step is to extend the scope \nto coastal and marine areas through the source-to-sea \napproach which recognises the need to address marine \npollution from land-based sources and to manage \nfreshwater and coastal pollution issues in a holistic way. \n\nNote:  SDG 6.5.1 baseline scores (0-100) grouped into the three subregions (blue \u2014 MED South; red: MED Balkans and Turkey; green: MED EU). \nFigure adapted from UN ESCWA (2019).\n\nSource:  UNSTATS, 2020. \n\nFigure 3.34  Degree of IWRM implementation (SDG 6.5.1)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nPercentage\n\n60 70 80 90 100\n\nVery low Low Medium-low Medium-high High Very high\n\nMED EU\n\nMED South\n\nMED Balkans and Turkey\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n96 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n3.3 Industrial emissions \n\n3.3.1 Industrial emissions assessment \u2014 key messages\n\n\u2022 Industrial installations in the Mediterranean \nregion need support to upgrade the \ninfrastructure and retrofit their industrial \nprocesses in line with BAT with increased \nresource-use efficiency and greater adoption of \nclean and innovative technologies in order to attain \nthe target set by SDG 9.4. \n\n\u2022 Primary sectors that should receive support \nfor implementing BAT are the manufacturing \nindustries, such as the food-processing and \nbeverages industry and the chemical industry \nresponsible for the release of nutrients; and the \nmanufacturing of refined petroleum products and \nchemical industry principally responsible for the \ndischarge of toxic substances.\n\n\u2022 Reporting by industries on their production \nactivities and polluting effluents must be \nregulated to ensure full coverage of sources in \nthe country and to enable industry to mainstream \nenvironmental management within industrial \nfacilities. \n\n\u2022 Industrial sectors need a stable legal framework \nand comprehensive regulations to attract \nfinance and investment for sustainable \nindustrial infrastructure in the MED South \ncountries to modernise industrial processes and \nensure return on investment in a more efficient \nmanner. \n\n\u2022 Increasing the technical capacity of national \nreference laboratories with greater capacity for \nthe enforcement authorities should be a primary \nconcern at both the national and regional levels.\n\n\u2022 MED South countries need targeted capacity \nbuilding related to industrial infrastructure not \nonly to ensure modernisation, optimisation and \nmaintenance of their industrial processes, but also \nto increase the level of control of releasing and \nmonitoring pollutants effectively.

Other relevant \nwater pollutants are heavy metals, such as cadmium \n(Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and copper (Cu), which \nhave harmful effects on the environment and human \nhealth. In addition, industrial activities lead to soil \ncontamination through the release of heavy metals, \nmineral oils and other types of hydrocarbons. These \npollutants can negatively affect human health due to \ntheir carcinogenic, teratogenic or hormone-disrupting \nproperties (EEA, 2019d).\n\nSteps have been taken by all Contracting Parties in the \nMediterranean region to monitor and control industrial \npollution. From a regional perspective, industrial \nemissions are addressed under the LBS Protocol. \nUnder the LBS policy and regulatory framework, \n10\u00a0legally binding regional plans were adopted by \nthe Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention, \nwith concrete measures to prevent and control the \nrelease of nutrients, POPs, mercury and marine litter. \nAt the national level, countries have adopted NAPs \nunder the LBS regulatory framework, and introduced \nlegal measures concerning ELVs for specific industrial \nsectors and/or specific pollutants, and environmental \nquality standards (EQSs) for receiving water bodies. \nThe legislation encompasses measures regarding the \nestablishment of monitoring and reporting systems for \n\nWASTE\n\nWATER\n\nINDUSTRIAL \nEMISSIONS\n\n6.16.26.3 6.4\n\nRelease of nutrients from industrial sectors\n\nRelease of toxic substances from industrial \nsectors\n\nIndustrial hazardous waste disposed of in\nan environmentally sound manner\n\nCompliance measures aimed at reduction of \npollutants generated by the industrial sector\n\n6.1\n\n6.2\n\n6.3\n\n6.4\n\nSource:  ETC/ICM-Deltares. \n\nFigure 3.35  H2020 industrial emissions indicators used to inform progress across the source-to-sea \ncontinuum\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n98 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nSAP-MED priority pollutants, regulation of wastewater \nand air emission discharges from industrial and urban \ninstallations, and use of sanctions in the event of \nnon-compliance. Of the 30 activity sectors primarily \nconsidered in Annex I of the LBS Protocol, 21 are \nindustrial. Priority has been given to toxic, persistent and \nbioaccumulable pollutants (TPBs) owing to their effects \non human health, biodiversity and the preservation of \necosystems and long-term/long-distance effects (40).\n\n3.3.3 A 'source\u2011to\u2011sea' approach to the industrial \nemissions thematic area\n\nFour core pressure and response indicators were \ndeveloped, as illustrated in the source-to-sea releases \nof industrial pollutants depicted in Figure 3.35. These \nindicators reflect pressures exerted from industrial \ninstallations in terms of releases of nutrients and \ntoxic substances into water (PAH and VOC to air) and \nresponses taken by the countries; environmentally \nsound management of hazardous wastes; as well \nas\u00a0compliance measures aimed at the reduction \nand/or elimination of pollutants generated by \nindustrial\u00a0sectors in the Mediterranean countries. \n\nWhile this assessment provides an in-depth analysis \nof industrial pollution at the regional and subregional \nlevels, the aim is to provide answers to 'five key \nquestions' focusing on industrial emissions, as listed \nin Box 3.11. This is achieved by a quantitative analysis \nwith available data for the four updated H2020 \nindicators (Figure 3.35). \n\nAssessment findings are presented at the regional \nand three subregional levels: MED South, MED EU \nand MED Balkans and Turkey. It should be noted that \nthe aggregated illustration at the subregional level \n(graphs, charts, etc.) may sometimes be impacted by \nthe performance of an individual country. This is due \nto the heterogenous status of the countries clustered \nin these subregions, based on comparatively different \nsocio-economic parameters such as size, economy and \ndemographic performances, etc. \n\n3.3.4 Approaches and tools for reporting pollutant \nreleases from industrial facilities in the \nMediterranean \n\nContracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention report \ntheir data and information on industrial emissions to \nthe Mediterranean Pollution Assessment and Control \nProgramme of UNEP/MAP in line with the legally \nbinding requirements of the Barcelona Convention and \nits Protocols (Barcelona Convention, 1995; UNEP/MAP, \n2012d). All Contracting Parties are legally mandated, \nas stipulated in Article 13 of the LBS Protocol, to report \ntheir inventory of pollutants into the Mediterranean \nSea through the five-yearly (2003, 2008, 2013 and 2019) \nNBB. In the absence of an NBB, they should submit \ndata and information obtained through their annually \nreported E-PRTR (E-PRTR; EEA, 2019) further to closing \nreporting gaps in order to convert E-PRTR data into \nNBB data.\n\nA brief comparison of NBB and E-PRTR shows that \nthe NBB is more detailed in terms of its sectors and \nsub-sectors. The NBB covers 30 sectoral categories \nand 97 subsectors, whereas the E-PRTR has 9 industrial \nactivities and 65 subcategories. In terms of groups of \npollutants, the NBB includes parameters such as BOD, \nCOD and suspended solids (SS), whereas E-PRTR only \nconsiders TOC. Finally, it should be noted that NBB has \n\n(40) Less attention is paid to other pollutants, such as toxic and non-persistent or not-bioaccumulable substances, suspended solids, biodegradable \norganic matter and nutrients, because their effects are much more localised and less persistent in the marine environment.\n\nBox 3.11  Key questions \n\n1. What are the main pressures (i.e. pollutant \nemissions) from the industrial sectors?\n\n2. How are the trends in pollutant emissions related to \nthe prevailing industrial sectors?\n\n3. In view of existing data on pollutant loads, what is \nthe regional data landscape on national and regional \ninformation systems?\n\n4. What are the regional responses to preventing \npollution from industrial sectors?\n\n5. What are the key messages that can be extracted \nfrom this assessment to enable the countries to \nalleviate the adverse impacts of industrial emissions \nfrom land-based sources on the Mediterranean \nmarine environment?\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n99Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nno thresholds for reporting releases of pollutants from \nindustrial facilities, whereas E-PRTR applies specific \nthresholds for reporting. \n\nThe main sectors concerning this assessment and \ncategories for NBB and E-PRTR are presented in Table \n3.20. Detailed comparisons on the subsector and \nactivity level for NBB and E-PRTR, respectively, are \npresented in Annex D.\n\nAnalyses in this report are based on reported loads \nwhich are an aggregation of releases of nutrients to \nwater; aggregation of releases of heavy metals to \nwater; and aggregation of toxic substances such as PAH \nand VOC to air. Both four cycles of NBB and E-PRTR \n(V17) constitute the two main sources of reported \ndata used for this assessment on industrial releases, \nassumingly compliant with national and regional \nemission standards. In addition, data and information \nextracted from the Barcelona Convention Reporting \nSystem (BCRS) were used to assess the compliance \naspect in the report (41). NBB reports are submitted \nby MED South countries as well as MED Balkans and \nTurkey. E-PRTR data are reported by MED EU countries. \nData and information provided in the NBB reports are \n\nmaintained in the NBB/E-PRTR Info System (42) which is \nembedded in the BCRS. This is a networked information \nsystem intended to provide overall support to NBB \nreporting. The system provides tools for managing, \nsharing and preserving data and information for MED \nPOL users and Contracting Parties to the Barcelona \nConvention. E-PRTR data is maintained by the EEA and \nis accessible to the public (43). \n\nThe geographical scale for this assessment for MED \nSouth countries and MED Balkans and Turkey is based \non the boundaries of the administrative regions in \nwhich the land-based sources of pollution affecting \nthe Mediterranean Sea are located (pertaining to NBB \ndata). The geographical scale for the MED EU countries \nis the hydrological basins delineated under the WFD, \nwhich flow into the Mediterranean Sea (pertaining to \nE-PRTR data). \n\nHence, for this assessment, four cycles of NBB reports \nare used for the countries in the MED South as well as \nthe MED Balkans and Turkey. For MED EU countries, \nE-PRTR data reported in 2008, 2013 and 2017, \nreferenced as E-PRTR V17, are considered. E-PRTR V17 \nincludes detailed information on emissions and off-site \n\nTable 3.20  Links between NBB and E-PRTR main sectors and categories for industrial emissions\n\nE-PRTR sector Related NBB sector(s)\n\nEnergy sector Production of energy\n\nManufacture of refined petroleum products\n\nProduction or processing of metals Manufacture of metals\n\nMineral industry Manufacture of cement\n\nManufacture of other inorganic chemicals\n\nChemical industry Manufacture of other organic chemicals\n\nManufacture of fertilisers\n\nManufacture of pharmaceuticals\n\nManufacture and formulation of biocides\n\nPaper and wood Manufacture of paper\n\nIntensive livestock production and \naquaculture\n\nFarming of animals (cattle, sheep, swine, poultry) and slaughterhouses\n\nFarming of special animals (rabbits, goats, horses, asses, mules and hinnies, other)\n\nAnimal and vegetable products from the \nfood and beverages sector\n\nFarming of animals\n\nAquaculture\n\nAnimal and vegetable products from the \nfood and beverages sector\n\nFood packing\n\nAgriculture\n\nOther activities Manufacture of textiles\n\nTanning and dressing of leather\n\n(41)  The BCRS provides records on the compliance of the Contracting Parties with implementation of the legally binding provisions of the Barcelona \nConvention and its Protocols https://idc.info-rac.org/ \n\n(42)  http://193.206.192.122/infomap/medpol/en \n(43)  https://prtr.eea.europa.eu/#/home \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n100 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\ntransfers of pollutants and waste from around 34 000 \nindustrial facilities located in Cyprus, France, Greece, \nItaly, Malta, Slovenia and Spain (44). Data from Slovenia \ndo not appear in this section since current emission \nsources into the Adriatic Sea from Slovenia are smaller \nthan E-PRTR thresholds.\n\n3.3.5 Key industrial emission trends\n\nAssessment findings on the release of nutrients from \nindustrial sectors \n\nMany industries produce liquid wastewater with \nnutrients in their effluent with similar characteristics to \ndischarged domestic wastewater from UWWTPs. Their \nmain pollutants are biodegradable organic matter, \nN,\u00a0P and suspended solids. Their pollution load may \nbe\u00a0reported and measured as BOD load and/or TOC.\n\nThe principal industrial sectors which contributed to \nthe BOD loads discharged to the Mediterranean in \ntheir wastewater in 2018 are shown in Figure 3.36. \nFor the MED South countries, the predominant sector \nis the food-packing industry which discharged more \nthan two thirds of the amount of BOD loads, followed \nby agriculture and farming of animals at almost one \nquarter (National Baseline Reports \u2014 NBB, 2018).\n\nFor the MED Balkans and Turkey, the principal sector \nis the food-packing industry which discharged almost \nhalf of the BOD loads followed by the manufacturing \n\nUpdated H2020 industrial emission indicators\n\nIND 6.1: Release of nutrients from industrial sectors:\n\n\u2022 IND 6.1.1: Total BOD load discharged from \nindustrial installations to the Mediterranean marine \nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 IND 6.1.2: Total nitrogen load discharged from \nindustrial installations to the Mediterranean marine \nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 IND 6.1.3: Total phosphorous load discharged from \nindustrial installations to the Mediterranean marine \nenvironment.\n\nof\u00a0textiles (mostly in Turkey), and agriculture and \nfarming of animals which together discharged almost \none third of BOD loads. \n\nFor the MED EU countries, based on 2017 figures, \nthe principal industries discharging nutrients are the \nchemical industry and paper and wood production, \neach constituting more than one third of the \ndischarges. These are followed by the energy sector \nat\u00a0almost one quarter of the discharged amount \n(E-PRTR V17, EEA 2019).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that aquaculture is an emerging \nsector in the region. For example, in 2014, Albania's \nmarine fisheries constituted 68\u00a0% of the aquaculture \nsector (FAO, 2019a). In Turkey, the aquaculture sector \nhas steadily grown since 1995 with exports of fish \nand fishery products worth USD 858 million in 2017 \n(FAO,\u00a02019b). Similar growth is observed in Greece, \nwhere the export net worth of fishery products was \nreported at USD 743 million in 2013 (FAO, 2019a).\n\nTo assess releases of nutrients from industrial facilities \nin the Mediterranean countries, three sub-indicators \nwere developed. These relate to the release of BOD, \nTN and TP. Discharged loads and trends for these \npollutants at the country level for 2003, 2008, 2013 \nand\u00a02017/2018 are presented below.\n\nLoads and trends in the discharge of BOD\n\nThe BOD load is reflected in H2020 sub-indicator 6.1.1. \nThe indicator is calculated on data obtained from four \ncycles of NBB pollutants reports and from the E-PRTR \nV17 (45). Figure 3.37 shows the BOD loads and their \ntrends from 2003 to 2018 for the industrial sectors \nin MED South countries as well as MED Balkans and \nTurkey (NBB Reports \u2014 1st to 4th Cycles, 2003-2018). \nFigure 3.38 shows loads and trends for TOC (46) in a \nnumber of MED EU countries (EEA, 2019f).\n\nAs can be inferred from Figure 3.37, discharged BOD \nloads for reporting countries from the MED South \ncountries as well as MED Balkans and Turkey vary on \naverage between 1 000 and 70 000  tonnes per year, \nwith the exception of Algeria where discharged BOD \nloads are in excess of 400 000  tonnes/year. \n\nAs regards trends in BOD discharge, Figure 3.37 does \nnot yield a clear conclusion at the regional level. \n\n(44) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/industry/stationary/index.htm\n(45) Both the NBB and the E-PRTR aim to provide the most accurate data on pollutants released into the environment. Although their set-up and \n\ncontent are of similar characteristics, they vary in several aspects, as explained in Annex III.1. For the purpose of this assessment, data acquired \nfrom the pollutant loads released into the marine environment for the four cycles of NBB reporting (2003, 2008, 2013, 2018) and the three \nE-PRTR reports (2008, 2013, 2017) were analysed.\n\n(46) BOD is not used in regular E-PRTR reporting by EU Member States. Instead, the parameter TOC is utilised to measure the amount of carbon \nfound in an organic compound and is often referred to as a 'non-specific indicator of water quality'.\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n101Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nChemical industry\n\nIntensive livestock production and aquaculture\n\nAnimal and vegetable products from the food and beverage sector\n\nEnergy sector\n\nOther activities\n\nManufacture of pharmaceuticals\n\nFarming of animals\n\nAquaculture\n\nProduction of energy\n\nManufacture of refined petroleum products\n\nProduction of metals\n\nManufacture of paper\n\nFood Packing\n\nE-PRTR Sector NBB Sectors\n\nPercentage\n\nManufacture of textiles\n\nTanning and dressing of leather\n\nProduction and processing of metals\n\nPaper and wood production and processing\n\nMED Balkans\nand Turkey\n\nMED South\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nChemical industry\nIntensive livestock production and aquaculture\nEnergy sector\nProduction and processing of metals\nPaper and wood production processing\nAnimal and vegetable products from the food and \nbeverage sector\nOther activities\n\nMED EU\n\nManufacture of pharmaceuticals\nFarming of animals\nAquaculture\nManufacture of refined petroleum products\nProduction of metals\nManufacture of paper\nFood packing\nManufacture of textiles\nTanning and dressing of leather\n\nNote:  Horizontal representation as a proportion of the loads per\u00a0industrial\u00a0sectors\u00a0to the total reported loads.

For Israel and Turkey, \nthis decrease may be attributed to the stringent \nimplementation of legislation and enforcement \nprocedures on industries. For Montenegro, the \ndecline in BOD releases may be attributed not only to \nfurther improved implementation of relevant national \nlegislation but also to a shift in economic activities \nprimarily to tourism and services. \n\n20172008 2013\n\nFrance Greece Italy Malta Spain\n\n1\n\n1 000 000\n\nTonnes/year\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\n100 000\n\nFigure 3.38  TOC loads from industrial sectors in \nselected MED EU countries\n\nNote:\u00a0 Datasets plotted in logarithmic scale.\u00a0\n\nSource:  E-PRTR V17; EEA (2019f).\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n103Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nAs for the MED EU countries, releases of TOC into the \nMediterranean are shown in Figure 3.38. As can be \nseen, discharges of TOC varied from 300 to almost \n7 000 tonnes in 2017 (47). Trends in discharged loads \nindicate a general decrease in the release of TOC for \nFrance, Greece and Malta. For Italy and Spain, a slight \nincrease can be seen. \n\nIn order to assess the relative contribution of UWWTPs \nto the discharge of TOC to water, country industrial \nprofiles for each MED EU country were analysed \n(EEA,\u00a02019a). For Malta, discharges are released by a \nsingle sector, i.e. waste management. For France, 53\u00a0% \nof the TOC contribution originates from wastewater \ntreatment, whereas 23\u00a0% and 13\u00a0% can be traced to \nthe pulp, paper and wood industry, and to the food \nand beverages industry, respectively. For Greece, the \nwastewater sector amounts to 95\u00a0% of the TOC load, \nwhereas only 5\u00a0% is attributed to the energy supply \nsector. For Italy, 77\u00a0% is contributed by wastewater \ntreatment; 10\u00a0% and 5\u00a0% are attributed to the \n\nenergy supply and chemical sectors, respectively. \nTOC contribution in Spain is 76\u00a0% from wastewater \ntreatment, and 11\u00a0% and 6\u00a0% from the chemical sector \nand pulp, paper and wood sector, respectively. \n\nLoads and trends in the discharge of total nitrogen\n\nTN load is reflected in the H2020 Indicator 6.1.2, which \nis calculated on data obtained from four cycles of \nNBB reports and from the E-PRTR V17 (EEA, 2019f). \nFigure\u00a03.39 shows the TN loads and their trends from \n2003 to 2018 for the industrial sectors in the MED South, \nMED Balkans and Turkey (NBB, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018) \nas well as MED EU countries (E-PRTR V17; EEA, 2019f).\n\nAt the regional level, and as can be inferred from \nFigure\u00a03.39, discharged TN loads in 2018 for reporting \nMED South countries vary widely from 200 to 7\u00a0000 \ntonnes per year. For Montenegro and Turkey, TN loads \nvary from 10 to 1 100  tonnes.

At the national level, and according \nto the country profiles, France releases 5\u00a0% and \n3\u00a0%\u00a0of TN loads from the chemical and energy supply \nsectors, respectively. Greece discharges 4\u00a0% from \nthe chemical sector. For Italy, 4\u00a0% is attributed to the \nchemical sector and 4\u00a0% to waste management. In \nSpain, 2\u00a0%\u00a0of discharged TN is from the chemical sector. \nMalta is different as all of the TN loads emanate from \nthe energy sector. Lastly, for Cyprus, TN is released \nprincipally from WWTPs (EEA, 2019a). \n\nAs regards trends in releases of nitrogen, and as can be \ninferred from Figure 3.39, loads of discharged nitrogen \nfrom previous years do not yield a clear conclusion at \nthe regional scale. However, a consistent decline in \nreleases of TN is observed in Israel and Turkey which \nis in line with the decrease of BOD releases mainly \nfrom the food industry. This can be attributed to \nmore stringent enforcement of legislation targeting \n\nindustrial facilities. On the other hand, a slight increase \nis observed in Syria which can be explained by the \nmassive movement of industries from other parts of \nthe country to the conflict-free coastal zone.\n\nLoads and trends in the discharge of total phosphorous\n\nTP load is reflected in H2020 Indicator 6.1.3. The \nindicator is calculated on data obtained from the \nNBB Reports of 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018, and \nfrom the e-E-PRTR (E-PRTR V17; EEA, 2019f) for 2008, \n2013 and 2017.

Clearly, discharged loads of TP are \nhighest in the MED South countries. \n\nFurther to the assessment of the country industrial \nprofiles for each MED EU country, there is an indication \nthat the relative contribution of UWWTPs is about \n90\u00a0% to TP releases at the subregional level (MED EU \ncountries). At the national level, and according to the \ncountry profiles, the main TP contributor in Greece \nis the chemical industry which releases 6\u00a0% of TP \ndischarge nationally (the remaining 94\u00a0% is due to \nUWWTPs). In France, the food and beverages industry \ncontributes 4\u00a0% of TP loads, followed by the chemical \nindustry with 3\u00a0%. For both Italy and Spain, 6\u00a0% is \nreleased by waste management. \n\nAs regards trends in the discharge of phosphorous, \nFigure 3.40 does not yield a clear conclusion at the \nregional level for MED South countries. Variations \nbetween 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 may be due \nto reporting issues related to the methods used to \nestimate discharged loads. For MED EU countries, but \nwith the exception of France, there is a general increase \nin the release of phosphorus into the Mediterranean. \nOnce again, discharged loads of TP are highest in the \nMED South countries.\n\nAssessment findings on the release of toxic substances \nfrom industrial sectors \n\nMost Mediterranean countries have an important \npublic industrial sector which is composed of large \nindustries, such as energy production, oil refineries, \npetrochemicals, basic iron and steel metallurgy, basic \naluminium metallurgy, fertiliser production, paper \n\nUpdated H2020 industrial emission indicators\n\nIND 6.2: Release of toxic substances from industrial  \nsectors:\n\n\u2022 IND 6.2.1: Total heavy metals load discharged from \nindustrial installations to the Mediterranean marine \nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 IND 6.2.2: Furans and dioxins load discharged from \nindustrial installations to the Mediterranean marine \nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 IND 6.2.3: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) \nload discharged from industrial installations to the \nMediterranean marine environment.\n\n\u2022 IND 6.2.4: Volatile organic compounds (VOC) load \ndischarged from industrial installations to the \nMediterranean marine environment.\n\nand paper pulp, and cement production. Of concern \nare the pollutants released by these industries in both \nliquid and gaseous states, comprising organic and \ninorganic substances that are toxic, persistent and \nbioaccumulable (TPBs). The former are referred to as \nPOPs and the latter include some heavy metals such as \nCd, chromium (Cr), Cu, Pb, Hg and zinc (Zn) as well as \nother organometallic compounds. Other pollutants of \nrelevance include furans and dioxins (PCDF and PCDD), \nPAH, and VOC. These pollutants are generated in large \nquantities by the aforementioned industries and their \ndischarge into the environment can cause damage to \nhuman health, ecosystems, habitats and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2017/2018, the principal sectors which contributed \nto the release of heavy metals into water are depicted \nin Figure 3.41 for the MED South, MED Balkans and \nTurkey and MED EU countries. \n\nFor the MED South countries, and further to data from \nthe NBB Reports, 4th Cycle (NBB, 2018), the principal \nsector contributing almost 90\u00a0% to the release of heavy \nmetals is manufacturing of refined petroleum  \nproducts. For the MED Balkans and Turkey, the \nprincipal sectors are distributed mainly between the \nrefining of petroleum products, tanning and dressing of \nleather, and the manufacture of cement, contributing in \ntotal to almost 75\u00a0% of releases. For MED EU countries, \nand further to data reported in 2017, the principal \nsector responsible for the release of almost 80\u00a0% \nof heavy metals (E-PRTR V17; EEA, 2019f) is energy \nproduction.\n\nTo assess releases of toxic substances from \nindustrial facilities in the Mediterranean countries, \nfour sub-indicators were developed. These relate \nto discharges of heavy metals (discharges to water), \nPCDF\u00a0and PCDD, PAH and VOC. Discharged loads and \ntrends for these pollutants at the country level for 2003, \n2008, 2013 and 2018 are presented below. \n\nLoads and trends in the discharge of heavy metals\n\nTotal heavy metals load is reflected in the H2020 \nIndicator 6.2.1 which is calculated based on data \nobtained from NBB reports (NBB, 2003, 2008, 2013, \n2018) and from the E-PRTR V17. Figure 3.42 shows \nheavy metals loads (Arsenic (As), Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, nickel \n(Ni), Pb and Zn) released into water and their trends \nfrom 2003 to 2018 for the industrial facilities in the \nMediterranean countries. \n\nAt the regional level, and as can be inferred from \nFigure\u00a03.42, discharged heavy metals in 2018 for \nreporting countries from the MED South varied on \naverage from 1 000 to 100 000\u00a0kg/year, and in Albania \nand Turkey.

For MED EU \ncountries, heavy metal loads varied in 2017 from \n200\u00a0to 65 000\u00a0kg per year, with the exception of Malta. \nGenerally speaking, discharged loads of heavy metals \nare highest in the MED South countries.\n\nAt the national level, and in contrast to releases \nof nutrients, attributed mainly to UWWTPs, \nheavy metals are principally released from large \nindustrial facilities. For instance, Albania reported \nfive industrial facilities discharging heavy metals \nwhich are manufacturers of cement (Albania NBB, \n2019). Bosnia and Herzegovina reported a single \nenergy production facility and around 10 cement \nmanufacturing plants as the main contributors to \n\nreleases of heavy metals (Bosnia and Herzogovina \nNBB, 2019). In Israel, two fuel-manufacturing facilities \nand nine thermal-power-generation plants release \nmost heavy metals into water (Israel NBB, 2019). \nIn Lebanon, heavy metals are released mainly by \n21 thermal-power-generation plants and other \ncombustion installations as well as 8 mineral industries \nthat produce cement clinker in rotary kilns (Lebanon \nNBB, 2019). In Tunisia, five relatively large cement \nmanufacturing plants are reported to produce heavy \nmetals (Tunisia NBB, 2018). Turkey has reported an \nincrease of 54\u00a0% and 52\u00a0%, based on the industry \ndensity index (48), for energy production, and the \ntransport and marketing of petroleum products \nsectors, respectively.\n\nNote:  Datasets plotted in logarithmic scale. *For MED EU, year 2017.\n\nSources:  NBB Reports \u2014 1st to 4th Cycles: NBB, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, E-PRTR V17; EEA (2019f).\n\nFigure 3.42  Cumulative\u00a0loads\u00a0of\u00a0heavy metals\u00a0from industrial sectors, discharged directly or indirectly \ninto the environment\n\nHeavy metals load (kg/year)\n\n1\n\n100 000 000\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\n10 000 000\n\nCro\natia\n\nCyp\nru\n\ns\n\nFra\nnce\n\nGre\nece Ita\n\nly\nMalta\n\nSp\nain\n\nAlge\nria\n\nEgy\npt\n\nIsr\nael\n\nJord\nan\n\nLe\nbanon\n\nLib\nya\n\nMoro\ncc\n\no\n\nPalesti\nne\n\nSy\nria\n\nTunisi\na\n\nAlbania\n\nTurk\ney\n\n2003 2008 2013 2018*\n\nMED Balkans\nand Turkey\n\nMED EU MED South\n\n(48)  Industry index is a tool used in NBB to benchmark the number of industries in specific regions.

At the national \nlevel, and further to the assessment of the country \nindustrial profiles for each MED EU country (EEA, 2019a), \nit has been found that water releases from UWWTPs \nin France contribute almost 45\u00a0% of heavy metals \n(weighted by eco-toxicity); 18\u00a0% from energy supply; \n13\u00a0% from the chemical industry; and 8\u00a0% from the food \nand beverages sector. In Italy, 71\u00a0% is from UWWTPs, \n12\u00a0% from the chemical industry and 8\u00a0% from ferrous \nmetals industries. Spain is similar where 84\u00a0% of heavy \nmetals releases into water are from UWWTPs, 10\u00a0% from \nenergy supply and 2\u00a0% from the chemical industry. \n\nAs regards trends in the discharge of heavy metals, \nFigure 3.42 does not yield a clear conclusion at the \nnational level. Variations between 2003, 2008, 2013 \nand 2018 may be due to reporting issues related to the \nmethods used to estimate discharged loads. \n\nAt the national level, there is a slight decrease in the \nrelease of heavy metals in Israel, Syria, Tunisia and \nTurkey. In Israel and Turkey, this can be attributed to \nthe strict enforcement of legislation and the monitoring \nof large installations. For the MED EU countries, except \nMalta, there is a general decrease in the release of \nheavy metals into the Mediterranean.\n\nLoads and trends in the discharge/emission of furans \nand dioxins\n\nPCDF and PCDD loads to air are reflected in the \nH2020 Indicator 6.2.2.

For Bosnia and Herzegovina as \nwell as the MED EU countries, PAH emissions varied \nbetween 50 and 600\u00a0kg/year. While diffuse emissions \nfrom industry are not the focus of this report, for some \nsubstances such as mercury and PAHs, they produce \nsignificant loads to water in Europe (EEA, 2018).\n\nWith regards to the trends of discharge of polyaromatic \nhydrocarbons, it is not possible to infer from the limited \nnumber of best available data the actual trends in \ntheir emissions.

Contracting Parties' reports to the BCRS for \nthe period 2016-2017 on progress in the \nimplementation of the Protocol on the Prevention \nof Pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by \nTransboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes \nand their Disposal (Hazardous Wastes Protocol); and \n\n2. Mediterranean Countries' national reports \nsubmitted to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention \nbetween 2016 and 2017.\n\nThis review enabled the extraction of some data on the \nmanagement tools used by these countries to handle \nhazardous waste, particularly in relation to the data \nrequired for populating H2020 Indicator 6.3 with its \ntwo sub-indicators on the quantities of generated and \ndisposal of hazardous waste in an environmentally \nsound manner.\n\nQuantities of hazardous waste generated\n\nThe quantities of hazardous waste generated are \nreflected in H2020 Indicator 6.3.1. According to the \nContracting Parties' reports to the BCRS, 'measures \naimed at reducing to a minimum or where possible \n\nUpdated H2020 industrial emission indicators\n\nIND 6.3: Industrial hazardous waste disposed in \nenvironmentally sound manner:\n\n\u2022 IND 6.3.1: Total quantity of generated hazardous \nwaste from industrial installations.\n\n\u2022 IND 6.3.2: Quantity of industrial hazardous waste \ndisposed in environmentally sound manner relative \nto total quantity of generated hazardous waste from \nindustrial installations.\n\neliminating the generation of hazardous wastes are \nat the heart of the domestic legislation on waste \nmanagement adopted in all reporting Contracting \nParties, as per the requirements of the Hazardous \nWastes Protocol'. Further to the national countries' \nreports submitted to the Basel Convention (Basel \nConvention, 2017), the total volume of hazardous waste \ngenerated varies widely between various countries \nand regions, as shown in Table 3.21. In the MED South \ncountries, the hazardous waste generated varies from \n2 500 to 2.7 million tonnes/year. In the MED Balkans \nand Turkey, the amount varies between 10 000 and \n1.4 million tonnes per year. While in MED EU countries, \nthe hazardous waste generated varies from 36 000\u00a0to \n11 million tonnes/year. At the Mediterranean level, \nEgypt, France, Italy and Spain are among the countries \ngenerating the largest amounts of hazardous waste \n(11\u00a0million  tonnes/year for France and Italy and \n2.7\u00a0million  tonnes/year for Egypt).\n\nQuantities of disposed hazardous waste\n\nThe quantities of disposed hazardous waste are \nreflected in H2020 Indicator 6.3.2. As regards the \nquantities of industrial hazardous waste disposed of \nin an environmentally sound manner (IND 6.3.2), only \none third of the Mediterranean countries reported \non disposal aspects in their national reports to the \nBasel Convention, as shown in Table 3.21. Basically, as \nindicated in the table, disposal facilities are limited in \ncapacity and do not exceed 100 000 tonnes. Countries' \nreports further indicate that hazardous waste is \ngenerally managed in two ways: one part is recycled \nlocally, incinerated or exported, while a second part is \nstored without any appropriate treatment. Figure\u00a03.47 \nprovides a visual comparison between the amounts \ngenerated by Mediterranean countries and their \ndisposal capacities. As can be inferred from the table, \nthe amount of disposed waste does not exceed one \nquarter to one third of the amount generated, the \nremainder being exported and/or disposed of in an \nunsafe way.\n\nIn this respect, it should be noted that the storage \nof industrial hazardous waste cannot be seen as a \nsustainable way of managing it. Identifying countries' \navailable means and capacities for the treatment and \ndisposal of hazardous waste is a critical and urgent step \ntowards coping with the amounts of hazardous waste \ngenerated annually that accumulate in storage centres. \nThis challenge is related to difficulties countries face \nin collecting information from industrial installations \nto improve data management and processing at the \ncentral level. \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n112 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nCompliance measures aimed at the reduction \nand/or elimination of pollutants generated by \nindustrial\u00a0sectors\n\nIn order to assess compliance measures aiming to \nreduce and/or eliminate pollutants generated by \nindustrial sectors, three sub-indicators were developed. \nThese relate to reporting by industrial installations and \ncompliance; environmental inspections; and the \nelimination of hot spots.

As can be inferred, \nthe Contracting Parties have appropriate measures in \nplace to eliminate land-based sources of pollution as \nwell as institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks \nto address pollution, including an authorisation and \npermitting system for industrial installations. However, \nFigure 3.49 shows that almost two thirds of the countries \nare unable to enforce the adopted measures or monitor \nthe level of compliance by industrial installations.\n\nThe enforcement measures remain a major challenge. \nWeak institutional structures, a lack of competences \nand skilled enforcement officers, and a limited number \nof personnel are all considered to be among the main \nobstacles to the implementation of proper enforcement \nand sanctioning mechanisms. In addition, the lack \nof well-established infrastructure enabling public \naccess, and the poor management of records are also \nexacerbating this situation. This gap is flagged in the \nfindings of the SoED 2020 report (UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, \n2020) which recommends increasing efforts and capacity \nbuilding for the inclusion of systematic operational and \nenforcement instruments in environmental policies \n(UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020).\n\nElimination of hot spots\n\nThe elimination of hotspots is the third H2020 \nsub-indicator on compliance measures (IND 6.4.3). \nIt\u00a0refers to the number of eliminated hot spots reported \nin the updated NAPs (Decision IG.22/8; UNEP/MAP, 2015) \nrelative to the 2001 and 2015 baselines. The 2001 hot \nspots baseline is defined further to the first assessment \nundertaken in 1999 and updated in 2003, whereas a \ncomprehensive and multidisciplinary methodology was \nintroduced reflecting SAP-MED priorities and public \nhealth. The 2003 hot spots assessment yielded the \nidentification and prioritisation of 101 Mediterranean \nhot spots. Hotspots are defined either as 'point \nsources on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea \nwhich potentially affect human health, ecosystems, \nbiodiversity, sustainability or economy in a significant \nmanner', or 'defined coastal areas where the coastal \nmarine environment is subject to pollution from one \nor more point or diffused sources on the coast of the \nMediterranean which potentially affect human health \nin a significant manner, ecosystems, biodiversity, \nsustainability or economy'. In\u00a02014, the assessment \nmethodology for hot spots was further updated \naccording to criteria comprising three main steps: (1) \nscreening for the listing of potential pollution hot spots \n\nAlbania\n\nBosn\nia &\n\n H\nerze\n\ngo\nvin\n\na\n\nMontenegr\no\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nNumber of hot spots\n\n0\n\n9\n\nEgy\npt\n\nAlge\nria\n\nIsr\nael\n\nLe\nbanon\n\nJord\nan\n\nMoro\ncc\n\no\n\nPalesti\nne\n\nTunisi\na\n\nHot spots 2003 Hot spots 2015\n\nSource:  Barcelona Convention Reporting System, UNEP/MAP and InfoRac, 2020.\n\nFigure 3.50  Change in number of hot spots between 2003 and 2015\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n116 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nand sensitive areas; (2) assessing potential hot spots \nand sensitive areas based on updated criteria; and (3) \ntesting the implementation of the updated assessment \ncriteria on specific examples. Accordingly, the number \nof hot spots reported in the updated NAPs (UNEP/MAP, \n2015) dropped to 28. This number corresponds to the \nelimination of 73 hot spots from the 2001 baseline of \n101. Hence, IND 6.4.3 indicates 72\u00a0% for the number \nof eliminated hot spots reported in the updated \nNAPs (UNEP/MAP, 2015) relative to the 2001 baseline. \nFigure\u00a03.50 provides a graphical illustration of the \nreduction in the number of hot spots reported in 2003 \nin\u00a0comparison with 2015. As can be seen, the number \nof\u00a0hot spots declined in all Mediterranean countries \nwith\u00a0the exception of Lebanon. \n\n3.3.6 Regional data landscape of national and regional \ninformation systems\n\nData availability\n\nIn contrast with the MED EU countries, the inventory of \nindustrial emissions in the MED South countries must \nstill\u00a0be further developed and streamlined with E-PRTR \nat the national level. Data on pollutant releases and \nproduction activities from these industries in MED South \ncountries are not always available. The coverage of \nindustrial pollutants remains limited when considering \nthe number of existing sources identified by the countries \nin the NBB reports. The number of industries for \nwhich pollutant loads are quantified are based on best \navailable\u00a0data and the application of emission factors.\n\nMain data gaps and uncertainties\n\nThe main data gaps and uncertainties can be categorised \naccording to the EEA's MDIAK chain (see\u00a0Section B; \nFigure\u00a02.7).\n\nFurther to the 4th cycle of NBB reports submitted by the \ncountries in 2018, a detailed analysis of the information \nprovided was undertaken regarding difficulties and \n\nchallenges the countries faced. The challenges \nwere grouped under each aspect (monitoring, \ndata, indicators, assessment and knowledge). \nFunding-related issues were added in each step \nas\u00a0an\u00a0overarching challenge. \n\nAn analysis of the results revealed that these aspects \ncan be associated with each step of the MDIAK chain, \nas shown in Figure 3.51. As can be inferred, most \nchallenges and difficulties facing countries are related \nto monitoring processes and data collection, both \nof which account for more than 65\u00a0% of the total \ndifficulties reported. \n\nWith reference to the findings in Figure 3.51, it is \nimportant to invest in improving the monitoring and \ndata-collection infrastructure and related human \ncapacities, particularly for the MED South countries, \nas well as MED Balkans and Turkey. Technical and \nfinancial support is an important prerequisite to \nestablish and fortify the sustainability of producing \nknowledge for policymakers in the region.\n\nThe findings in Figure 3.51 further illustrate that most \nof the MED South countries are facing difficulties, for \nvarious reasons, in moving towards the assessment \nand knowledge production that can be used by \npolicymakers in an integrated way. A typical example \nof data gaps preventing the sound management of \nhazardous waste is illustrated in Box 3.12.\n\nRegional response to data reporting\n\nAn in-depth examination of the NBB reports \n(NBB,\u00a02003, 2008, 2013, 2018) provided by the MED \nSouth countries and of national reports submitted to \nthe Basel Convention reveals that national institutions \nare facing some difficulties in collecting monitoring data \nfrom industrial facilities on a regular basis, due in part \nto the lack of national legislation for regular reporting \nby industry. Another challenge is the lack of qualified \nhuman resources for processing and analysing \ncollected data in order to develop syntheses and \nproduce reports on the levels of pollutant discharges \nfrom industries. And even when data are available at \nthe enterprise level, they are not routinely collected for \ncentralisation, processing and exploitation at the local \nor regional environmental service level. \n\nTo address the above aspects, the EU funded the \n'SEIS South Support Mechanism' project which aimed \nto support the countries by enhancing their national \ninfrastructure and data systems and adjusting and \nextending, where appropriate, the regional data \ninfrastructure and management systems to cover data \nmanagement for assessing the agreed H2020 initiative \nindicators.

This aims \nto promote resource efficiency and curtail the use of \nhazardous chemicals by setting agreed standards (BATs) \nfor different industrial activities.\n\nTo better assess the situation in the Mediterranean \nconcerning industrial manufacturing processes in terms \nof sustainable industrialisation and the application of \ninnovative technologies, including resource and energy \nefficiency, data for three subregions were extracted and \nsegregated from the platform for SDG 9.4 (UNSTATS, \n2020). The definition of SDG 9.4, its target and indicator \nare presented in Box 3.13.\n\nSDG 9.4 measures the amount of CO2 emissions from \nfuel consumption produced by an economic activity per \n\nunit of economic output. When computed for the whole \neconomy, it indicates the combined effects of: (1) the \naverage carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to \nthe shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); (2) the \nstructure of an economy (linked to the relative weight \nof more- or less-energy-intensive sectors); and (3) the \naverage efficiency in the use of energy. This is shown in \nFigure 3.52 for data extracted from the SDG platform.\n\nFigure 3.52 indicates that CO2 emissions per unit of \nGDP are increasing for MED South countries, which \nreflects a carbon-intensive economy, in contrast to MED \nEU countries which show a declining trend. Bearing in \nmind the recent economic crises in the EU region, this \nimplies that MED EU countries' economies are moving \ntowards becoming less carbon-intensive.\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\n0 .35\n\n0.40\n\n0\n\n0.45\n\nKg of CO2 per constant 2010 USD\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey\n\nBox 3.13  SDG 9.4\n\n\u2022 SDG goal: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation.\n\n\u2022 SDG target: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased \nresource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial \nprocesses, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities.\n\n\u2022 SDG indicator: CO2 emission per unit of value added.\n\nFigure 3.52  SDG 9.4.1: CO2 emissions per unit of GDP between 2000 and 2016\n\nSource:  UNSTATS (2020).\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n119Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nWhen the SDG 9.4 indicator is computed for the \nmanufacturing sector, as illustrated in Figure 3.53 \n(CO2 emissions per unit of manufacturing added \nvalue (MVA)), it measures the combined effect of: (1) \nthe carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic \noutput (average carbon intensity of energy mix used); \n(2) the structure of the manufacturing sector (the \nenergy efficiency of production technologies in each \nsubsector); and (3) the economic value of the various \noutput. In general, manufacturing industries are \nimproving their emission intensity as countries move \nto higher and more efficient levels of industrialisation. \nBut emission intensities can also be reduced through \nstructural changes, the modernisation of industrial \nprocesses, improvements in emission control and \npollution abatement technologies, and product \ndiversification in manufacturing. Lower values of CO2 \nper unit of MVA could be interpreted as more efficient \nmanufacturing structures and less pollutants. \n\nFigure 3.53 further indicates that MED South countries \nhave a carbon-intensive manufacturing industry in \ncontrast to MED EU countries, taking into consideration \nthat the manufacturing sectors addressed by the SDG \n9.4 indicator are linked to NBB sectors and subsectors \n(presented in Annex D). \n\nIt may be concluded, based on Figure 3.52, that the \nmajor challenge facing industries in the MED South, \nand to a lesser extent in the MED Balkans and Turkey, \nis the need for investment in innovative and clean \ntechnologies and their continuous maintenance and \ncontrol by qualified staff. \n\nThis also requires an urgent need for large investments \nin research and development where, based on Figure \n3.54, the Mediterranean governments have allocated \nlimited resources amounting on average to less than \n1\u00a0% of GDP. The exceptions are France, Israel and \nSlovenia which allocate around 2\u00a0% and 4\u00a0% of national \nGDP, respectively, for research and development. \nTherefore, the region needs substantial support for \nindustry to upgrade the infrastructure and retrofit \nindustrial processes in line with BAT to make them \nsustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and \ngreater adoption of clean and environmentally sound \ntechnologies, in compliance with the SDGs. \n\nAccordingly, there is an urgent need for an assessment \nof pollution abatement within the industrial sector, \nand for more sustainable industrial processes in the \nMED South and MED Balkans and Turkey to identify \nthe support needed to attract the investment required \n\nSource:  UNSTATS (2020).\n\nFigure 3.53  SDG 9.4.1: Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of MVA\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n1.50\n\n2.00\n\n2.50\n\n0\n\n3.00\n\nAverage of CO2 emissions per unit of MVA in kg CO2 per constant 2010 USD\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nMED EU MED South MED Balkans and Turkey\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n120 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nSource:  UNSTATS (2020).\n\nFigure 3.54  Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP (%)\n\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n0 0,5 1 1,5 3 3,5 4,5\n\nMontenegro\n\nBosnia & Herzegovina\n\nAlbania\n\nSpain\n\nSlovenia\n\nMalta\n\nItaly\n\nGreece\n\nFrance\n\nCyprus\n\nCroatia\n\nM\nED\n\n E\nU\n\nTurkey\n\nSyria\n\nMorocco\n\nJordan\n\nIsrael\n\nEgypt\n\nAlgeria\n\nTunisia\n\n% of GDP\n\nM\nED\n\n S\nou\n\nth\nM\n\nED\n B\n\nal\nka\n\nns\nan\n\nd \nTu\n\nrk\ney\n\n52 2,5 4\n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n121Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nover the next 10 years (i.e. 2030) to attain SDG 9.4 (and \ncommitments in the Paris Agreement). For the MED EU, \nthe European Commission has initiated the European \nGreen Deal (EC, 2019a) which aims to achieve the EU's \nclimate and environmental goals by adopting a new \nindustrial policy based on the circular economy and \ninnovative technologies. These measures include an \ninitial roadmap of key policies including, among others, \ncutting emissions by investing in cutting-edge research \nand innovation to preserve the natural environment.\n\nLegal and institutional structures: All the Mediterranean \ncountries have developed measures to combat \nindustrial pollution, such as the promulgation of \nregulatory texts to set levels of releases to the \nenvironment (ELVs), and to specify methods of \nmanagement and treatment of industrial waste. \nHowever, in most cases, countries have limited, \ndecentralised infrastructure to monitor and implement \nthe adopted regulations. This poses a significant \nobstacle, particularly in the MED South and MED \nBalkans and Turkey for sustainable data management \nand for the development of an integrated knowledge \nbase which, in turn, hinders the ability of enforcement \nauthorities to implement the respective regulations. \n\nThe MED EU countries have adopted the Industrial \nEmissions Directive (2010/75/EU; EU, 2010) \nwhich sets authorisation conditions for industrial \ninstallations, including permits, monitoring and \nreporting requirements. Furthermore, in Turkey, the \nonline environmental permits system, which sets \nauthorisation conditions for industrial installations and \nenables facilities to apply for environmental permits \nand licences, has been in operation since 2014.\n\nIn terms of regulations, and even though this \nassessment report focuses on releases to water, the \ncontrol of liquid, solid and gaseous emissions require \nthe enforcement of regulations by developing detailed \nmethodologies to conduct measurements and analysis \nof all polluting forms at the site level of each type \nof industry using a standardised reporting format. \nReporting by industries on their production activities \nand polluting discharges must be also regulated to \nensure full coverage of sources in each country and \nto enable industry to mainstream environmental \nmanagement within the industrial facilities.\n\nAs regards inspections, work is also under way to \nconsolidate monitoring and reporting plans in Albania, \nBosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In other \ncountries, such as Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco \nand Tunisia, there is limited evidence of the systematic \nimplementation of monitoring and reporting systems. \nBased on the review of the NAPs (Decision\u00a0IG.22/8, \nUNEP/MAP, 2015) these countries conduct ad \n\nhoc monitoring campaigns which are limited \nin\u00a0geographical scope, the number of parameters, \nand/or frequency. As regards the implementation of \nBAT,\u00a0MED EU countries have set permitting conditions \nwhich include ELVs. These conditions are associated \nwith a corresponding monitoring and reporting system \n(UNEP/MAP, 2019d).\n\nCapacity building: From a technical point of view, \nreinforcing the capacities of relevant departments \ndealing with industrial emissions, particularly in South \nMED countries, with equipment for measuring and \nanalysing pollutants as well as training to conduct \ninspections for emission compliance is essential \nfor the effective implementation and monitoring of \nregulations. Enforcement authorities are working \nwith national reference laboratories which analyse \nsamples for compliance. Therefore, increasing the \ntechnical capacity of national reference laboratories \nby improving the capacity of enforcement authorities \nshould also be a primary concern at both the national \nand regional level.\n\nThe sustainability of competent human resources \nwithin the institutions in charge of environmental \nevaluation, monitoring and enforcement is critical for \nregulating industrial emission releases and achieving \nnational and regional targets. Therefore, continuous \nsupport for and capacity building of human resources \nis of the utmost importance.\n\n3.3.8 Overall assessment summary and key messages\n\nFurther to the information provided in this assessment \non the release of nutrients and toxic substances into \nthe Mediterranean marine environment, answers to \nthe questions posed at the beginning of this section are \naddressed below. \n\nMain pressures from the industrial sectors\n\nRegarding the release of nutrients:\n\n\u2022 The assessment indicates that UWWTPs are \nreleasing higher nutrient loads than the industrial \nsector, whereas industry is more dominant on the \nrelease of heavy metals; \n\n\u2022 The main sectors responsible for the highest loads \nof nutrient discharges to water at the Mediterranean \nlevel are the food-packing and beverages industry, \nfollowed by agriculture and animal farming in \nthe MED South countries. For MED Balkans and \nTurkey, the principal sector is the food-processing \nindustry, followed by the manufacturing of textiles \nand agriculture and the farming of animals. For the \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n122 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nMED EU, the main sectors are the chemical industry \nfollowed by paper and wood production. Aquaculture \nis also a growing sector and is expected to grow \nfurther in the region in the future.\n\n\u2022 Reported releases of BOD loads in 2018 for \ncountries in the MED South and the MED Balkans \nand Turkey vary on average between 1 000 and \n70 000 tonnes per year. For MED EU countries, \ndischarge of TOC ranged from 300 to almost \n7\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes in 2017. \n\n\u2022 In 2018, the reported releases of nitrogen loads \nin MED South countries varied widely from 200 to \n7\u00a0000 tonnes per year. For Montenegro and Turkey, \nnitrogen loads vary from 10 to 1 100 tonnes per \nyear, while for MED EU countries, nitrogen loads \nvary from 500 to 5 000 tonnes per year.\n\n\u2022 Reported releases of phosphorus loads for the \nMED South countries, in 2018, varied widely from \n10\u00a0to\u00a03 500 tonnes per year. For Albania and Turkey, \nphosphorus loads did not exceed 400 tonnes per \nyear. For MED EU countries, in 2017, phosphorus \nloads ranged from 30 to 540 tonnes per year.\n\nRegarding toxic substances:\n\n\u2022 The impact of industry is more prominent in the \nreleases of toxic substance, particularly heavy \nmetals. Data also indicates that some light \nindustries are transferring their loads of heavy \nmetal to UWWTPs;\n\n\u2022 The principal sector contributing to the release \nof heavy metals in MED South countries is the \nmanufacturing of refined petroleum products. \nFor the MED Balkans and Turkey, the main \ncontributing sectors are refining of petroleum \nproducts, the tanning and dressing of leather and \nthe manufacturing of cement. For the MED EU, \nthe\u00a0principal sector responsible for the release of \nheavy metals is energy production.\n\n\u2022 In 2018, the reported releases of heavy metals \nby MED South countries varied on average from \n1\u00a0000\u00a0to 100\u00a0000\u00a0kg/year. The same range is also \nreported for MED Balkans and Turkey. For MED EU \ncountries, heavy metal loads varied in 2017 from \n200 to 65\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes/year.\n\n\u2022 Direct releases of heavy metals to water (weighted \non ecotoxicity) are mainly attributed to UWWTPs \n(EEA, 2019e) for MED EU countries. E-PRTR confirms \nthat direct releases of heavy metals are transferred \nto UWWTPs by industrial installations.\n\n\u2022 PCDD and PCDF emitted by reporting countries \nin 2018 are lower than 5\u00a0kg per year for the MED \nSouth and MED Balkans and Turkey. For the MED \nEU, the highest toxic equivalency is in Greece.\n\n\u2022 PAH emissions to air in 2018 by the MED South \ncountries ranged on average from 50\u00a0kg to 500\u00a0kg \nper year. The same range was also found in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina as well as the reporting MED EU \ncountries.\n\n\u2022 In 2018, emissions of VOCs to air from the MED \nSouth countries varied on average from 1\u00a0000 to \n10\u00a0000 tonnes per year. The range was lower in \nAlbania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the MED \nEU countries, the range varied on average from \n6\u00a0000 to 30 000 tonnes per year.\n\nTrends in pollutants' emissions related to the prevailing \nindustrial sectors\n\n\u2022 As regards the trends in the discharge of nutrient \nand toxic substances, it is not possible to infer \nfrom the limited number of best available data for \nMED South countries, as well as Albania, Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, Montenegro and Turkey, the \nactual trends in emissions over time. Variations in \nemissions from previous years (NBB 2003, 2008, \n2013) may be partly due to reporting issues related \nto the methods used to estimate discharged loads. \nTherefore, no conclusive statements can be reached \nregarding trends in the discharge of pollutants at \nthe Mediterranean Basin level.\n\n\u2022 For MED EU countries, trends in the discharge of \nTOC loads show a general decline for France, Greece \nand Malta, whereas for Italy and Spain, a slight \nincrease is observed. There was a general increase \nin the discharge of nitrogen (except France\u00a0and \nItaly), and a general increase in the discharge of \nphosphorus (except France) to the Mediterranean \nSea.\n\n\u2022 For MED EU countries, trends in the release of \ntoxic substances indicate a general decrease in \nthe release of heavy metals to the Mediterranean \n(except Malta), and a general decline in the release \nof PCDD and PCDF, PAH and VOC (except Greece).\n\nRegional data landscape on the national and regional \ninformation systems\n\n\u2022 Data and its availability must be further developed \nand streamlined with E-PRTR/NBB systems at \nthe national and regional level. Data on pollutant \n\f\nSection C: Thematic Assessment\n\n123Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nreleases and production activities from these \nindustries are not always available.\n\n\u2022 Data gaps:\n\n \u2013 Most of the MED South countries are facing \nmany challenges and difficulties to move \ntowards the assessment and production of \nknowledge for policymakers;\n\n \u2013 Difficulties and challenges are related to lack of \nfinancing and capacity building. At the national \nlevel, the countries are still pinned down to \nmonitoring and data collection, which account \nfor more than 65\u00a0% of the total difficulties \nreported.\n\nRegional responses to preventing pollution from \nindustrial sectors\n\n\u2022 Investments are needed for the industrial sector \nin the MED South countries in order to retrofit \nindustrial production processes which would lead \nto\u00a0resource efficiency and sustainable production. \n\n\u2022 In the business-as-usual scenario, it is unlikely the \ncurrent state of industrial processes will not achieve \nSDG 9.4 in 2030. \n\n\u2022 There has been a small increase in CO2 emissions \nsince 2014 in the MED EU countries; this requires \nmore continuous policies to further increase the \nefficiency and to apply BATs in Mediterranean \nregion. Such policies are already on the horizon, \nsuch as the Green Deal (EC, 2019a).\n\n\u2022 On the legal and institutional side, all Mediterranean \ncountries have developed measures to combat \nindustrial pollution, such as the promulgation of \nregulatory texts to set levels of releases to the \nenvironment (ELVs), and to specify methods of \nmanaging and treating industrial waste. However, \nin most cases, countries have limited, decentralised \ninfrastructure to monitor and implement the \nadopted regulations. This poses a significant \nchallenge, particularly in eastern and MED South \ncountries for sustainable data management and \nthe development of an integrated knowledge base \nwhich, in turn, hinders the ability of enforcement \nauthorities to implement the respective regulations.\n\n\u2022 From a technical point of view, reinforcement of \nthe capacities of different departments with the \nequipment to measure and analyse pollutants, \nas well as strengthening the capacity of national \nreference laboratories, are essential for the effective \nimplementation of and compliance with regulations.\n\n\u2022 The major challenge facing industries in the MED \nSouth countries and, to a lesser extent, in the MED \nBalkans and Turkey, is the need for investment \nin wastewater treatment systems and their \ncontinuous maintenance and control by qualified \npersonnel. For MED EU countries, industries still \nrequire support from the EU (e.g. Green Deal) for \nthe implementation of BAT as well as for increasing \nresource efficiency and applying emerging \ninnovations. \n\f\nTechnical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean124\n\nSection D: main conclusions\n\nMain pollution pressures\n\nDetailed key messages for each H2020 thematic \narea have been presented in the previous section, \ndrawing on the indicator-based thematic assessment. \nIn general, in terms of pollution, clear progress has \nbeen made on pollution prevention. This is most \nnotably illustrated by efforts towards restricting \nsingle-use plastic bags, improved access to sanitation \nnarrowing the gap between urban and rural areas, \nand the application of BAT/BEP for reducing industrial \nemissions and eliminating hot spots. However, \nthese interventions are not sufficient to curb the \npressures. They cannot compensate for the increase \nin plastic-waste generation \u2014 in line with growing \npopulation, tourism and production-consumption \ndrivers \u2014 and to ensure that the provision of safely \nmanaged sanitation keeps up with rampant population \ngrowth. Pollution pressures remain persistent, \nparticularly in rural areas, suburbs and slums where \nwaste and wastewater-collection services are either \nlimited or non-existent, but also in the coastal areas \nalong the Mediterranean where urban and industrial \ncentres are located. A\u00a0further reduction in key \npressures, such as waste and\u00a0marine litter, wastewater \nand industrial emissions, is required to achieve a clean \nMediterranean and the GES of its sea. \n\nThe indicator-based thematic assessment relied \nprimarily on the harmonised datasets delivered \nthrough the established H2020 reporting mechanism. \nFor many indicators, data is scattered between \ndifferent national stakeholders and coverage remains \npoor \u2014\u00a0both spatially and temporally. Data for \nwaste indicators requires the adoption and use of \ninternational standards and adequate statistical \ncapacities; data on water is generally managed by \nwater-supply companies, whereas wastewater falls \nin-between the responsibility of the Ministries of \nEnvironment and Municipalities; data on industrial \nemissions is under the remit of MED POL as part of \nthe regional inventories on pollutant releases and \nproduction activities. The lack of time-series data \n(e.g.\u00a0marine litter) makes it difficult to determine \ntrends. Although the coastal area is the most \nappropriate geographical and analytical scale \nto assess progress in terms of pollution into the \n\nMediterranean Sea and to devise effective spatially and \necosystem-based measures accordingly, data is mainly \navailable at the national scale, with the exception of \nindustrial emissions data that only covers industries \nlocated in coastal areas. Substantial efforts have \nbeen made to set up the H2020 reporting process \non both the national and regional side. However, the \nregional H2020 database is still in the making. For \nthis reason, the data and information base for the \nassessment was supplemented by publicly available \ndata collected\u00a0from open databases (e.g. World Bank, \nUNSTAT/SDG, Eurostat, ESCWA, etc.) and recent \nnational, regional and global assessments, expert \njudgement and documentation of examples and \nother evidence of progress as case studies. In some \ncases, the use of global databases was disputed by \ncertain countries on the basis that the source of data \nfor international organisations is unknown and the \nmethodologies used differ from national ones. In other \ninstances, data inconsistencies were encountered \nbetween different national and international sources. \nIn the case of industrial emissions, data on pollutant \nreleases and production activities from industries in \nMED South countries have not always been available \nand industrial pollutants are under-reported. Overall, \ndata availability and quality have not improved \nmuch since the previous\u00a0H2020 reporting exercise \nin 2014 (EEA and\u00a0UNEP/MAP, 2014). The available \ndata and knowledge base are not sufficient to \nprovide an affirmative evidence-based response to \nthe policy question \u2014 What is the progress towards \na cleaner Mediterranean? Which, however, can be \nbetter explained by understanding the context and \nin\u00a0particular the drivers of change.\n\nDrivers of change\n\nThe assessment of progress on the main pollution \npressures was conducted against a backdrop of the \nkey drivers of change, such as population, coastal \nurbanisation, economic growth and related changes \nin consumption patterns, tourism and the general \naspiration for a better quality of life in the region \n(Diwan et al., 2017). Although the nature of the \ndrivers of change have not changed markedly in \nthe last 30 to 40 years, their persistence over time, \n\n4 Section D: main conclusions\n\f\nSection D: main conclusions\n\n125Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nintensity, acceleration and cumulative effects are what \ndrives change in the Mediterranean region. These \nsocietal drivers are compounded by the widespread \nand ubiquitous impacts of climate change which is \nexacerbating the pre-existing challenges in the region \n(UNEP/MAP-Plan Bleu, 2020).\n\nCoastal population and tourism, associated with \ntake-make-waste economic models, are the main \ndrivers of plastic-waste generation and marine litter \nin the Mediterranean. The periodic geopolitical \ninstabilities and conflicts trigger population \ndisplacements, leading to surges in migration, such \nas the refugee crisis in 2015. The influx of refugees \nexacerbates the need for, among others, access to \nsanitation services and waste management. Political \ntensions affect the performance of industrial activities, \nsometimes causing their relocation to conflict-free \nareas. In more general terms, political instabilities \ndisrupt the progress in tackling pollution through \ndiscontinuities in implementing actions and developing \nnational capacities, the high turnover of staff in the \nauthorities concerned, causing a lack of sustainability \nand ownership. Shock events, such as the 2020 sanitary \ncrisis and associated quarantine due to COVID-19, have \ncaused a sharp drop in pollution pressures, although \nthis is only expected to be short term.  \n\nMajor efforts and progress \n\nMajor efforts have been made over the past 15\u00a0years \ntowards a cleaner Mediterranean. Undeniably, \nclear progress has been achieved in terms of legal \ninstruments, the creation and strengthening of \ninstitutional capacities, direct actions, regional data \ninfrastructure and tools. \n\nSignificant achievements have been made possible \nthrough regional collaboration under the umbrella of \nthe Barcelona Convention and countries' commitment \nto the 2030 Agenda. In implementation of the H2020 \nInitiative, concrete synergies with the SDGs have been \nidentified, for example by aligning the H2020 indicators \nwith SDG indicators, and using SDG indicators to \nsupplement and strengthen the analytic components \nof\u00a0this assessment. \n\nThe region has moved towards more integrated \npolicies, such as the EcAp and ICZM, which link different \nareas of work by UNEP/MAP and provide a more \nholistic approach to management. In response, in \nrecent years, efforts have been made to strengthen \ninstitutional and technical capacities, not only to \nsustain and enhance staff skills but also to develop \ncompetences to address these new challenges. These \nefforts build on the sustainability of established \n\ncooperation and expert networks, both at the national \nand regional level. \n\nDirect actions, including investments to prevent \npollution at source, reduce pressures or remediation of \nhot spots, capacity building and awareness raising have \nalso contributed to the progress made. An analysis of \ninvestment measures put forward by countries in their \nNAPs shows the prevalence of pollution-prevention \nmeasures in all three subregions. Other investments \nhave been allocated to strengthening capacities \u2014 \namong others, statistical capacities in view of the higher \ndemand for data, statistics and knowledge and the \nkey role of national statistical offices in responding \nto the requirements of the 2030 Agenda. When it \ncomes to awareness raising among civil societies and \ncitizens' involvement, concrete evidence documenting \nthese activities and their effectiveness was difficult to \nretrieve.\n\nIn terms of regional data infrastructure, the \ndevelopment of the InfoMAP platform by Info/RAC for \nthe provision and sharing of data, information services \nand knowledge marked a key milestone. The InfoMAP \nplatform represents a unique access point to all the \nreporting modules at the regional level, including \nreporting under the seven mandatory Protocols of the \nBarcelona Convention, NBB, IMAP pilot platform as well \nas H2020. Cooperation between UNEP/MAP and the EEA \nwithin the framework of the ENI SEIS II South Support \nMechanism was instrumental in adjusting and extending \nthe regional data infrastructure and management \nsystems to include data management for reporting \non the H2020 Initiative, and to support the countries \nin further developing their national infrastructure and \ndata systems. Overall, national infrastructure and tools \nhave evolved significantly with countries putting in place \ndedicated information systems for monitoring and \nmanagement of, for example, municipal and hazardous \nwaste. A\u00a0summary of the progress on aspects related \nto data infrastructure in the MED South countries is \nprovided inTable 2.1.\n\nIntegrated management of pollution\n\nThe application of the EcAp, adapted to the \nsource-to-sea paradigm as a tool for organising the \nH2020 indicators, guided the development of a more \nintegrated assessment of pollution which takes into \naccount systemic approaches, cross-linkages between \nthematic areas (e.g. waste and water through marine \nlitter; water and industrial emissions; waste and \nindustrial emissions), and tools that support integrated \nenvironmental management and policies, such as \nthe E-PRTR. Despite advances in an integrated way of \nthinking, full operationalisation and implementation \n\f\nSection D: main conclusions\n\n126 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nhave proven difficult and present major challenges \non the ground. Management approaches to pollution, \nincluding data collection and analysis, policies and \nlegal instruments, remain predominantly sectorial in \nmost countries. More integrated legal instruments, \ninclusive institutional set-ups, and multi-stakeholder \ngovernance frameworks are required for a more \nholistic and transdisciplinary approach. It is a priority \nfor the region to close the gap between policy visions \nand implementation processes, both at the regional \nand national level.\n\nTransition to more preventive and circular approaches\n\nProgress has been achieved in the region in the \ndevelopment and uptake of tools and guidance for \nthe transition to a blue, green and circular economy, \nsupported by the MSSD, the MSESD and the SCP Action \nPlan. These regional efforts are yielding results across \nthe whole Mediterranean, albeit at different rates. \nIn most MED EU countries, improvements in waste \nprevention, reduction/reuse/recycle have been observed \nas a result of the EU polices on waste management and \nthe EU Circular Economy package. Waste recycling is still \nlimited in MED South countries, while waste recovery \nis uncommon. Most countries in the MED South and \nMED Balkans and Turkey have adopted waste policies, \nplans, or strategies for waste management, both at the \nnational and subnational level. However, they must \nbe embedded in a larger resource efficiency/circular \neconomy framework or strategy that can lead to waste \nprevention and bring economic benefits. When it comes \nto the reuse of wastewater, overall, an increasing trend \nin direct reuse is seen across the Mediterranean region \nas a whole, indicating a more efficient use of the limited \nwater resources. \n\nAdditional improvements required\n\nImproved availability of data, especially for \npolicy/decision-makers, including timely and \nreliable\u00a0policy-relevant statistics would ensure sound \nand information-based decision-making. At the same \ntime, greater availability and accessibility of information \nto other users/public institutions (collect once, use for \ndifferent purposes) would make data collection more \ncost-effective. Although the principles and benefits of \ndata sharing are well understood, implementation is \nlagging behind. However, data production is a long-term \nprocess which also needs to capture longer-term \nchanges and delays in what can be observed in the \nenvironment. For this reason, continuous investment \nin the data-information business is even more critical. \nThe data management policy document presented \nat COP21 was a key step in the right direction. This \n\nreference document details the main\u00a0elements and \nroadmap for the preparation of a\u00a0UNEP/MAP data \nmanagement policy, acknowledging the need for a \ncommon data policy in the region that addresses the \nenvironmental data and information collected, acquired, \nprocessed and disseminated by UNEP/MAP through the \nInfoMAP system (Decision IG.24/2; UNEP/MAP, 2019). \nThe EU-funded SEIS projects (ENPI SEIS I and ENI SEIS \nII South) have paved the way to the data management \npolicy by putting in place the SEIS principles in the region \n(access, share, use of data, etc., as detailed in Box 1.1). \nA data policy will ensure that data and environmental \ninformation are accessible to enable comparisons of \nthe environment at the appropriate geographical scale \nand are fully available to the general public and users to \nencourage citizen participation. \n\nThe maintenance and enhancement of technical \ncapacities on monitoring, data and statistics, especially \nin the MED South countries, is another area requiring \nattention. More regular and better data collection \nby national and provincial offices will greatly benefit \ntechnical and policy efforts to improve pollution \nmanagement. As regards industrial emissions, MED \nSouth countries need targeted capacity building \nrelated to industrial infrastructure not only to ensure \nthe modernisation, optimisation and maintenance \nof their industrial processes, but also to increase the \nlevel of control over pollutant releases and monitoring \nin an effective way. Boosting the technical capacity \nof national reference laboratories through better \ncapacity for the enforcement authorities should \nbe a primary concern at the national and regional \nlevel. Special attention should be paid to statistical \ncapacities, in particular environmental statistics, in \nrelation to the statistical authorities' coordination \nrole in monitoring SDGs. Financial support is essential \nfor sustaining institutional capacities, with dedicated \nresources\u00a0allocated to knowledge management, \nbased on data/information/indicators, and to \nstrengthening capacities for monitoring and enforcing \nthe implementation of environmental legislation. This \nsupport should be part of a long-term commitment \nthat is not subject to changing priorities in response \nto emergency issues, for example, refugee and \nsanitary crises. With specific reference to the COVID-19 \npandemic, a clear commitment to 'building back better', \nfocusing on the sound management of hazardous \nand chemical waste; strong and global stewardship \nof nature and biodiversity; renewable resources and \nfacilitating the transition to a carbon-neutral future, \nwill\u00a0be key to a resilient and sustainable future.\n\nLack of enforcement was highlighted several times \nas an issue that is hindering the progress and \neffectiveness of technical, legal and institutional \nmeasures. A case in point concerns industrial \n\f\nSection D: main conclusions\n\n127Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nemissions. Whereas all Mediterranean countries have \nadopted measures to combat industrial pollution, most \ncountries have a limited, decentralised infrastructure \nto monitor and implement the adopted regulations. \nFrom a technical point of view, capacities in the \nrelevant departments dealing with industrial emissions, \nequipment for measuring and analysing pollutants, \nand training in conducting compliance inspections, \nparticularly in MED South countries, must be enhanced. \nSimilar challenges apply for the area of waste, where \na low level of enforcement is limiting improvements to \nwaste-management systems.\n\nHigh-level political support is necessary for investments \nto advance and to ensure their continuity. Access to \nfunds should be facilitated, including access to new \nfinancial instruments for green start-ups. Investment \ncapacities should be strengthened, especially in \nMED South countries, to support the identification \nof bankable projects and preparedness for project \npreparation and implementation. \n\nOutlook\n\nAfter 40 years of investments, the region needs to take \nserious action towards the coherent development and \nreporting of data, to invest massively in structuring the \ninformation needed to evaluate progress and to better \nuse the knowledge gained through monitoring for \naction. To achieve real/tangible progress, the knowledge \nbase must be actively strengthened to provide the \nscientific evidence required for environmental targets \nand threshold values to determine a 'good' ecosystem \ncondition. To sustain progress, countries need to build \non what has been accomplished so far, by establishing \na regular reporting mechanism, national infrastructure \nand cooperation network. \n\nPromising new developments related to data \n(e.g.\u00a0earth observation, artificial intelligence, mobile \nphones, citizen monitoring, models and novel in \nsitu measurements) and innovative approaches \n(e.g.\u00a0nature-based solutions) should be further \n\nexplored. Despite recent advances, developing \ncountries still face important challenges underlined by \nlimited capacities due to limited resources and funding. \nTargeted initiatives and investments could help unlock \nthe potential of more innovative approaches.\n\nClosing the gap between policy visions and \nimplementation processes will require acting in a truly \ncoordinated manner via the establishment of stronger, \nintegrative and participatory processes, organised \naround measurable targets for progress within \na\u00a0realistic time frame. This is urgent to strengthen \ninclusive and institutional set-ups towards efficient \nmulti-stakeholder governance frameworks to break the \n'silo effect' created by thematic/sectoral approaches \nand to enhance integrated and more systemic \napproaches. It is critical to enable a more operational \napplication of EcAp, including terrestrial, coastal and \nmarine dimensions, and to move from visions and pilot \nactivities to actual implementation. The recent Naples \nMinisterial Declaration of the Contracting Parties to the \nBarcelona Convention, 2019, notably describes 2020 \nas a 'critical turning point for the conservation and \nsustainable management of the Mediterranean Sea \nand coast' and underscores the 'need for a systemic \nchange supported by forward-looking and innovative \nstrategies, policies, and behaviours'.\n\nThe Naples Ministerial Declaration also renewed a\u00a0set \nof ground-breaking commitments, in particular in \nfour priority areas for action: by effectively tackling \nmarine litter, strengthening and expanding the \nnetwork of marine protected areas, responding to \nthe challenges arising from climate change, and \nsupporting a sustainable blue economy and an \necological transition for the Mediterranean region. \nThis is most coherent with Europe's promise for \na\u00a0set of deeply transformative policies in response \nto calls for climate and environmental action, the EU \nGreen Deal. Underpinned by the 2030 Agenda as the \ncommon reference framework, these commitments \nare timely and encouraging as a regional transition to \na more sustainable and circular approach and effective \ngovernance set-up has never been so urgent. \n\f\nTechnical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean128\n\nList of acronyms\n\n5 List of acronyms\n\nANGED  National Agency of Waste Management\n\nANPE  National Agency for Environment Protection\n\nAQUASTAT FAO's Global Information System on Water and Agriculture\n\nAs  Arsenic\n\nAVAC  Automated vacuum collection\n\nBAT  Best available technique\n\nBCRS  Barcelona Convention Reporting System \n\nBEP  Best environmental practice\n\nBOD  Biological oxygen demand\n\nBREFs  Best available techniques reference documents\n\nCd  Cadmium\n\nCEDARE  Centre for Environment and Development for the Arab Regions and Europe \n\nChl a  Chlorophyll\n\nCMEMS  Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service \n\nCOD  Chemical oxygen demand \n\nCOP  Conference of the Parties\n\nCO2  Carbon dioxide\n\nCPs  Contracting Parties\n\nCr  Chromium\n\nCu  Copper\n\nDPSIR  Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Response\n\nEBM  Ecosystem-based management\n\nEBRD IPPF European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility\n\nEEA  European Environment Agency\n\f\nList of acronyms\n\n129Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nEcAp  Ecosystem approach\n\nEGP  Egyptian pounds\n\nEIB  European Investment Bank\n\nEIONET  The European Environment Information and Observation Network  \n\nELVs  Emission limit values\n\nENI  European Neighbourhood Instrument\n\nENPI  European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument\n\nEO  Ecological objective\n\nEPR  Extended producer responsibility\n\nE-PRTR  European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register\n\nEQS  Environmental quality standard\n\nETC/ICM  European Topic Centre /Inland, Coastal and Marine waters  \n\nGDP  Gross domestic product\n\nGEF  Global Environment Facility \n\nGEO  Global environment outlook\n\nGES  Good environmental status\n\nGHG  Greenhouse gases\n\nGIZ  German Corporation for International Cooperation GmbH\n\nHDPE  High-density polyethylene \n\nHg  Mercury\n\nH2020  Horizon 2020\n\nICM  Integrated coastal management\n\nIE  Industrial emissions\n\nIMAP  Integrated Monitoring and Assessment Programme\n\nIMF  Integrative Methodological Framework\n\nIND  Indicator\n\nInfoMAP  Information and Communication Mediterranean Action Programme\n\nInfoRAC  Information and communication Regional Activity Centre\n\nISS  Improved sanitation system\n\f\nList of acronyms\n\n130 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nIWRM  Integrated water resources management\n\nJICA  Japan International Cooperation Agency\n\nJRC  Joint Research Centre\n\nLAS  League of Arab States\n\nLBS  Land-based sources\n\nMAP  Mediterranean Action Plan\n\nMDG  Millennium Development Goal\n\nMDIAK  Monitoring- Data-Information-Assessment- Knowledge\n\nMED 5P  Public-Private Partnership Project Preparation in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean \n\nMED Balkans  \nand Turkey Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Turkey\n\nMED South South Mediterranean Countries\n\nMED EU  EU Mediterranean Countries\n\nMED POL Mediterranean Pollution Assessment and Control Programme of UNEP/MAP\n\nMeHSIP  Mediterranean Hot Spot Investment Programme\n\nMoLG  Ministry of Local Government\n\nMRF  Material Recovery Facility\n\nMSESD  Mediterranean Strategy on Education on Sustainable Development\n\nMSFD  Marine Strategy Framework Directive\n\nMSSD  Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development\n\nMSW  Municipal solid waste \n\nMVA  Manufacturing added value\n\nNAP  National action plan\n\nNBS  Nature-based solution\n\nNBB  National baseline budget\n\nNGO  Non-governmental organisation\n\nN  Nitrogen\n\nNi  Nickel\n\nNOx  Nitrogen oxides\n\f\nList of acronyms\n\n131Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nNSWMP  National Solid Waste Management Programme\n\nODA  Official Development Assistance\n\nOECD  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nP  Phosphorous\n\nPAH  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon \n\nPANACeA Protected Areas for Enhanced Natural Conservation and Protection\n\nPb  Lead\n\nPCBS  Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics\n\nPCDD  Dioxin\n\nPCDF  Furan\n\np.e.

This means smaller discharges are not included and hence \nactual loads are higher. \n\n*    MED South does not include data for Jordan. As this indicator considers loads from municipal wastewater originating from \nurban agglomerations \u2265 2000 p.e. situated in coastal hydrological basin and those agglomerations with direct access to the \nMediterranean, it is not applicable to Jordan due to lack of direct accessibility to the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless, after \nthe rehabilitation of the Khirbat Al-Samra WWTP in 2008, BOD5 and Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus are within limits \nbut these need to be monitored due to unplanned emission of effluents resulting from the presence of Syrian refugees \n(Jordan\u00a0NAP, 2016).\n\n**    In the case of Lebanon and Bosnia & Herzegovina, values refer to nutrient loads of the untreated wastewater. The same \nis assumed for Syria as WWTPs are currently not operating optimally. In Palestine, BOD loads refer to both treated and \nuntreated wastewater.\n\n***  Under E-PRTR reporting, TOC is reported instead of BOD.\n\f\nAnnexes\n\n151Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nD.

Supplementary information on \nInfoMAP regional infrastructure\n\nEstablished by the\u00a0Barcelona Convention, the mission \nof the Information and Communication Regional \nActivity Centre (INFO/RAC) is to provide adequate \ninformation and communication services and \ninfrastructure technologies on public participation of \nBarcelona Convention (Article 15) and on reporting \n(Article 26)\u00a0 related to the issue for the protection of the \nMediterranean marine and coastal environment. From \nJanuary 2010, the functions of INFO/RAC in ensured by \nthe\u00a0Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and \nResearch (ISPRA).\n\nINFO/RAC is responsible to manage dataflows related \nto the Barcelona Convention reporting obligations \n(BCRS, NBB, and IMAP), data policy, data exchange \nprotocols, online reporting tools, as well as further \n\ndeveloping the governance IT platform for common \nstandardisation and specification of data.\n\nINFO/RAC has designed the InfoMAP System that is \nthe UN Mediterranean knowledge platform conceived \nto provide and share data, information services and \nknowledge for the benefit of the Mediterranean Action \nPlan (MAP) components and Contracting Parties, based \non the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) \nprinciples. It is also able to support the Mediterranean \nQuality Status and the State of Environment Report. \nIts\u00a0main scope is to: \n\n\u2022 Provide access to reporting system;\n\n\u2022 Harmonise data structure and models;\n\n\u2022 Create a common catalogue of resources;\n\nInfoMAPSystem\n\nPlan Bleu\nData flow\n\nSCP/RAC\nData flow\n\nSPA/RAC\nData flow\n\nREMPEC\nData flow\n\nREPAP/RCA\nData flow\n\nDATA\nCENTRE\n\nInteroperability Layer\n\nMedPol\nSystem\n\nInfoM\nAP\n\nPlatform\n\nDATA\nINTEGRATION\n\nIMAP\nSystem\n\nBarcelona\nConvention\nReporting\n\nSystem\n\f\nAnnexes\n\n161Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n\u2022 Integrate data with interoperability layer;\n\n\u2022 Create a common platform to view, query and \nanalyse data;\n\n\u2022 Produce tools to support data & information \ndissemination.\n\nThe InfoMAP platform represents the unique access \npoint to the all the InfoMAP nodes and other data \nservices at regional level. The InfoMAP platform is \ncomposed of:\n\n\u2022 InfoMAPNode (Geoportal to orchestrate the Spatial \nData Infrastructure);\n\n\u2022 The Data Centre Reporting system;\n\n\u2022 The MEDPOL Info System;\n\n\u2022 The IMAP Pilot Platform.\n\nInfoMAPNode\n\nThe InfoMAPNode is the portal to manage and access \nto the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). Developed \nin the biennium 2018-2019, the InfoMAPNode is an \nopen source geoportal for sharing with different \nlevel of authentications, geospatial data, maps and \nrelated metadata of relevance for the Mediterranean \narea. It represents, also, the entry point to InfoMAP \nSpatial Data and Metadata catalogue based on open \nsource suite. It is composed by a set of technical and \nnon-technical components that facilitate the sharing of \ngeographic information. The main components are:\n\n\u2022 Spatial Data Management system to store, query \nand manage directly the data in the database;\n\n\u2022 A Catalogue system with a specific discovery \nservice to harvest, search and query metadata \nand with integrated Metadata editor. the system \nis implemented on the open software component \nGeoNetwork;\n\n\u2022 Network Service system based where data are \ndistributed and elaborated via Web Service (mainly \nfollowing OGC/INSPIRE Standard);\n\n\u2022 A portal within a client to search, view, query and \nanalyze the spatial data. It is based on the software \npackage GeoNode.\n\nThe main functionality of InfoMAPNode application \nare: upload, manage and share geospatial, non-spatial \ndata; create and modify metadata; create and share \n\ninteractive maps and collaborate and interact with \nother users or group of users.\n\nIn the framework of the EU funded 'ENI-SEIS II South \nSupport Mechanism' project, UNEP/MAP and EEA \ncollaborate to support the implementation of the \ninfrastructure and data management component of \nthe project. This implies specific support to ENI South \ncountries in enhancing their national infrastructure \nand data systems, as well as adjust and extend as \nappropriate the regional data infrastructure and \nmanagement systems to cover the data management \nneeds for assessing the agreed H2020 Initiative \nIndicators. The ENI SEIS II South project further builds \non the Decision IG.21/3, COP 18, Istanbul, regarding \ndata management in Mediterranean by developing \na Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) \nsupporting the regular production and sharing of \nquality assessed environmental data and indicators.\n\nThe InfoMAPNode is now available as final release \nversion 1.1 online at: http://infomapnode.info-rac.org/. \nAll the SDI components are realized within the INFO/\nRAC mandate and are already available and running \nin the Infrastructure. The platform provides users with \nvisualisation and interaction features with the most \nadvanced maps. Enabled users have the possibility \nto create maps by superimposing data loaded on the \nplatform together with visualization services provided \nby other servers.\n\nThe Data Centre\n\nAt the core of the InfoMAP System, the INFO/RAC Data \nCentre (IDC) aims at offering a reporting system that \nis officially used by the countries, based on common \nstandards and aligned with the EEA's reporting \nsystem Reportnet2. The IDC is like a bookshelf with \ndata reports on the environment as submitted \nto International clients. Each country either has a \ncollection for its deliveries or a referral to a different \npreferred repository. The data reports within each \ncountry collection are arranged under the relevant \nreporting obligations or agreements. The scope is to \nimprove the harmonisation and standardisation of the \nmanagement of data flows, from the detailed definition \nof the required data to the delivery of the final \ninformation products such as reports or environmental \nindicators. The services available through the IDC are \nthe following:\n\n\u2022 People directory: stores users credentials and \ninformation, allows to implement a single sign-in \nmechanism between InfoMAP services;\n\nhttp://infomapnode.info-rac.org/\f\nAnnexes\n\n162 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nFigure F.2  Schematic representation of the reporting system - Data integration in InfoMAP database\n\n\u2022 Groupware: web application that offers a set of \ntools useful to share documents; drafts, minutes, \netc. among the MAP Components of UNEP/MAP;\n\n\u2022 Data Dictionary:  component system able to manage \nthe different data flow, with defined  vocabularies/\ncode lists, quality control, etc;\n\n\u2022 Data Repository: share directory where each \ncountry can upload their data, following the \ndifferent data flow procedures;\n\n\u2022 Web form: web tool to compile the reporting \nobligation data flow.\n\nCurrently, the IDC manages two data flows to support \nthe obligation of Barcelona Convention (Barcelona \nConvention Reporting System (BCRS), National Baseline \nBudget Reporting (NBB)) as well as the Horizon 2020 \ndata flows. \n\nThe Barcelona Convention Reporting System (BCRS) \nis the InfoMAP module that allows Contracting Parties \nto report under article 26 of the amended Barcelona \nConvention and several articles of different Protocols \nof MAP. The main objective of the system is to collect, \nstore, manage and process compliance reporting data \n(textual and numerical) regarding the implementation \nof the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols. The \nMAP Secretariat has the legal responsibility of BCRS, \nwhereas INFO/RAC is responsible for its operation and \ndevelopment.\n\nThe BCRS data flow within the Data Center is \nsubdivided in seven mandatory protocols that \nContracting Parties have to report:\n\n\u2022 Dumping Protocol;\n\n\u2022 Land-Based Sources (LBS) Protocol;\n\n\u2022 SPA Protocol;\n\nIMAP Pilot Info\nsystem\n\nC.I.\n13, 14, 17, 21\n\nBCRS\nData flow\n\nhttps://idc.info-rac.org/bcrs\n\nH2020\nIndicators\n\nInfoMAPNode\nSpatial datasets\n\nNBB/PRTR\nData flow\n\nMEDPOL\nLegacy\n\ndatabase and\nreporting\n\nINFORAC\nData\n\nCentre\n(IDC)\n\nMigration\n\nPre-filling\n\nPre-filling\n\f\nAnnexes\n\n163Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\n\u2022 Prevention and Emergency Protocol;\n\n\u2022 Offshore Protocol;\n\n\u2022 Hazardous Wastes Protocol;\n\n\u2022 ICZM Protocol.\n\nThe National Baseline Budget (NBB) is an inventory \nof the pollutant's releases from all substantial Land \nBased Sources of pollution reported by the Contracting \nParties on yearly basis in order to monitor the \nimplementation of the Strategic Action Programme \n(SAP) and the National Action Plans (NAP) adopted by \nthe Contracting Parties in agreement with the Art. 5 of \nthe LBS protocol. MEDPOL Programme is in charge for \nthe follow up work related to the implementation of \nthe LBS and Hazardous Wastes Protocols. MEDPOL Unit \nassists Mediterranean countries in the formulation and \nimplementation of pollution monitoring programmes, \nincluding pollution control measures and the drafting \nof action plans aiming to eliminate pollution from \nland-based sources. INFO/RAC is responsible for the \noperation and development of the NBB data flow. NBB \ndata flow is integrated into the Data Centre since 2018.\n\nThe BCRS and NBB data flows are completely \noperational, and the data are provided by the \nContracting Parties through the web forms.\n\nThe Data Centre hosts also the Horizon 2020 data \nflows put in place with the support of the ENI SEIS II \nSouth project to enable ENI south countries to report \ndata needed for the production of the Horizon 2020 \nindicators. In the first step a specific repository for \nthe countries reporting on H2020 is set-up to provide \nindicators via excel file template, defined and prepared \nby INFO/RAC in a standard way.\n\nThe MEDPOL Info System\n\nThis system provides tools to collect, manage, share \nand store MEDPOL pollution monitoring data and \ninformation (including defined location of monitoring \nstations). MEDPOL has the legal responsibility of \nthe MEDPOl Information system, and INFO/RAC \nis responsible for its operation and development. \n\nThe IMAP Pilot Platform\n\nIn the framework of the Programme of Work and \nBudget for 2018\u20132019 of UN Environment/MAP \n(Decision IG.23/14), INFO/RAC is leading the work \non the development of the 'InfoMAP platform for the \nimplementation of IMAP fully operative and further \n\ndeveloped, connected to MAP components' information \nsystems and other relevant regional knowledge \nplatforms, to facilitate access to knowledge for \nmanagers and decision-makers, as well as stakeholders \nand the general public' (output 1.5.1).\n\nThe EU funded EcAp-MED II Project is supporting this \noutput by the development of a Pilot IMAP Compatible \nData and Information System (IMAP (Pilot) Info System), \nthat would enable the Contracting Parties to start \nreporting data as of mid-2019 for selected 11 IMAP \nCommon Indicators and laying down the basis for \nbuilding a fully operational IMAP Info System as \nprovided for by Decision IG.22/7.\n\nThe IMAP (Pilot) Info System has been developed \nby INFO/RAC in close consultations with \nUN Environment/MAP Components. The IMAP \n(Pilot) Info System receives and processes data \naccording to the agreed Data Standards (DSs) and \nData Dictionaries (DDs) that set the basic information \non data reporting within IMAP.\n\nINFO/RAC has also developed the Data Standards \nand Data Dictionaries for each of the 11 selected \ncommon indicators, covering all three clusters of \nIMAP (Biodiversity and non-indigenous species (NIS), \nPollution and Marine Litter, Coast and Hydrography). \n\nThe IMAP Pilot Info System is ready, fully operational \nand able to collect data from 1st July 2019. The IMAP \nPilot Info System website is accessible to the general \npublic.\n\nThe Horizon 2020 data flow\n\nThe Horizon 2020 data flow collects data for the \nset of indicators selected for the second phase \nof H2020 (2015-2020). National reporting is managed \nand coordinated by data focal points and data \nreporters nominated by each country. They have \ndifferent roles and tasks, which are the following:\n\n\u2022 Data Focal Point - an expert or group of experts \nnominated by the country and authorised to be \nthe main contact point for the data submission to \nINFO/RAC. The main role of Data Focal Point is to \ncoordinate the national network, review the data \nuploaded and validate the data submission.\n\n\u2022 Data Reporters - responsible for delivering national \ndata to the data repository. They receive upload \npermissions for specific folders only. The main role \nof data reporter is to collect data from the national \nteam in the standard format and upload them into \nthe information system.\n\f\nAnnexes\n\n164 Technical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\n\nThe data flow followed the agreed common reporting \nformat and detailed indicator factsheet developed \nfor each\u00a0H2020 indicator (57). All data flows are \nsubject to Quality Checks (QC), allowing to document \nmethodological aspects, such as definition, units, \ngeographical and temporal coverage, method for gap \nfilling and uncertainties. Horizon 2020 data flow and \nreporting from partner countries is monitored via \na dedicated\u00a0dashboard (58).\n\nData structure definition: The H2020 dataflow \nis based on templates 'spreadsheets' (59) (excel files \nprocessed by an automatic procedure) developed \nby thematic experts, distribution of 'geotemplates' \n(60) or shapefile (coastline, administrative units, \nhydrological basins, coastal cities, etc.).\n\nDeveloping webforms and data model for H2020 \nreporting: Webforms can offer users templates with \npre-filled data harvested from different databases \n(external databases or other reporting for example first \nphase of the Project ENPI SEIS). The logical structure \nof a database needs to be defined to determine \nin which way data can be stored, organized and \nmanipulated. For that reason, data model is the entry \npoint for webforms development.  \n\nConsidering the data delivery for the H2020 reporting \ncoincides with the finalisation of the webforms two \noptions were proposed to the countries:\n\n1. Access the webforms that have been prefilled in \norder to double check the consistency with the \nspreadsheets and to make the necessary changes \nbefore submitting. \n\n2. If there is no discrepancy between the spreadsheets \nand the webforms, country will upload the \nspreadsheets that will be transformed in xml to be \nprocessed for quality check procedures. \n\nCode lists: In order to store all the data in a \ndatabase code lists need to be adopted to model \nthe database and relate all the elements in the \ndifferent tables. Furthermore, standardized code lists \nensure integration with other reporting tools such as \nReportnet or international reporting. ISO standards \nare used to ensure internationally recognized codes \nthat designate every element (61), for instance countries \nusing two-letter codes (ISO alpha-2). \n\nPre-filled solutions: Pre-filling is already implemented \nin InfoMAP system for instance for the BCRS and NBB \nreporting, however it has not been deployed for the \nH2020 data flow. \n\nTowards integration of Mediterranean data flows: \nAs part of the development and maintenance of \nrelevant Mediterranean data flows, EEA and Info RAC \nexplored the possible integration of data flows from \ndifferent sources, e.g Horizon 2020 data flows are \nfully integrated and accessible both from the InfoRAC \nData Centre and from the recently launched\u00a0WISE \nMARINE\u00a0platform under the Regional Sea Convention \nSection. The long term objective of such development \nis to ensure integration of data flows from Barcelona \nConvention\u00a0Integrated Monitoring and Assessment \nProgramme\u00a0(IMAP) Information System developed \nby INFO/RAC with the EU\u00a0Marine Strategy Framework \nDirective (MSFD)\u00a0reporting contributing to a \ncoordinated assessment of Good Environmental Status \n(GES) of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n(57) Indicator factsheets: https://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/areas-of-work/indicators-and-assessment\n(58) Dashboard https://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/areas-of-work/data-and-statistics\n(59) Link to Data submission (spreadsheets): \n\nhttps://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/areas-of-work/data-management-and-infrastructure\n(60) Link to Geotemplates and geotemplates documentation: \n\nhttps://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/areas-of-work/data-management-and-infrastructure/spatial-data-collection-and-update-under-eni-seisii-south-project\n\n(61) Link to data dictionaries: https://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/areas-of-work/indicators-and-assessment/all-data-dictionaries/view\n\nhttps://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/south/areas-of-work/indicators-and-assessment\f\nEuropean Environment Agency\n\nTechnical assessment of progress towards a cleaner Mediterranean\nMonitoring and reporting results for Horizon 2020 regional initiative  \n\n2021 \u2014 164 pp. \u2014 21 x 29.7 cm\n\nISBN 978-92-9480-254-5\ndoi:10.2800/898759\n\nGetting in touch with the EU\n\nIn person\nAll over the European Union there are hundreds of Europe Direct information centres.

The proportion of households connected to treatment facilities varies across Europe, from 97% in western and central Europe, to around 70% in southern, south-eastern and eastern Europe. However, urban waste water treatment now needs to address challenges like climate change, changes in population and newly emerging pollutants.\nExtreme weather events linked to climate change are bringing heavier and more frequent rainfall in some areas, but water scarcity in others, affecting how well storm sewers and treatment plants operate. Excessive rainstorms can overwhelm and overload sewer systems and lead to overflows at treatment plants, while a lack of rainfall can lead to problems in collection and treatment of sewage.\nSuch challenges are added to those routinely addressed by local authorities and water utilities, including financing construction, maintenance, operation and upgrades, as well as sourcing and retaining suitably skilled staff to deliver the necessary improvements in waste water treatment.\nThe EEA briefing also notes that antibiotics and other excreted pharmaceuticals are increasingly being found in waste water. These chemicals are among those forming a cocktail mix of chemicals, which cannot be easily tackled by many treatment plants, as they require costly, more stringent and energy-intensive treatment techniques.\nThe briefing notes that energy costs and scarce resources are reasons to promote water efficiency. Furthermore, they provide an opportunity for treatment plants to contribute more to recycling and reusing water and recovering materials like phosphorus, which can be collected during the treatment cycle. The briefing cites some examples of investments already being taken across Europe to improve waste water treatment resilience, with the use of retention ponds and rainfall reservoirs to manage water flows from flash floods, or in reusing water that has been treated and cleaned.\nDynamic\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-challenges-facing-europe2019s-wastewater or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 08:17 PM\nFiled under: waste water management urban waste water climate change urban waste water treatment directive uwwt directive freshwater consumption\nFiled under: waste water management, urban waste water, climate change, urban waste water treatment directive, uwwt directive, freshwater consumption\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Monitoring and evaluation of national adaptation policies throughout the policy cycle\n\n\nFacts and figures: the EMTER report\n\f\f\nFacts and figures: the EMTER report\n\f\nLegal notice\nThe contents of this publication do not necessarily reflect the official opinions of the European Commission or other \ninstitutions of the European Union.

Over one third of this came from container ships.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 40% of the EU population lives within 50 kilometres of the sea, so air emissions from ships are a particular \nconcern for coastal communities. In common with other forms of transport, ships emit substances including sulphur oxides \n(SOX), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulate matter (PM), which can affect human health. In 2018, the maritime transport sector \nproduced 24% of all NOx emissions, 24% of all SOx emissions and 9% of all PM2.5 emissions, as a proportion of national EU \nemissions from all economic sectors. \n\n\u2022 Underwater noise caused by ships\u2019 engines and propellers can cause hearing loss and create behavioural changes in marine \nanimals. Estimates suggest that, between 2014\u20132019, the total accumulated underwater radiated noise more than doubled in \nEU waters. \n\n\u2022 Non-indigenous species can invade new habitats by clinging to the hulls of ships as they move from port to port, or via ship \nballast water, which is taken on in one port and released in the ship\u2019s destination. The maritime transport sector accounts for \nthe largest proportion of the introduction of non-indigenous species in seas around the EU (51 high-impact species; almost 50% \nof the total) since 1949. \n\n\u2022 Even though the amount of oil transported by sea has been steadily growing for the last 30 years, the total amount of accidental \noil spills has been constantly declining. During 2010-2019, out of 44 medium size oil spills across the world, only five were \nlocated in European seas. Out of a total of 18 large oil spills across the world, only three happened in the EU.\n\n\u2022 Lost containers are a source of marine litter. Depending on the sea conditions at the time they were lost, they can remain intact \nin the water, or release part \u2013 or all \u2013 of their content. The percentage of total waste released through lost containers at sea is \nlow and considered negligible in the EU, with an average of 268 containers lost per year out of 226 million containers shipped \nworldwide.\n\n\u2022 The EU has a comprehensive package of rules addressing the environmental aspects of maritime transport, many of which \ngo beyond agreed international standards. However, future challenges for policymakers include a projected increase in global \nshipping, as well as climate change, which could see ports vulnerable to rising sea levels, and new permanent shipping lanes in  \nareas where they are currently not open all year round.\n\nIn brief\n\f\n \n\n4 Facts and figures: the EMTER report\n\nThe EU fleet\n\nIn 2019, ships registered to EU Member State flags \n(approximately 18 000 ships) made up almost one fifth of the \ntotal world fleet in dead weight tonnage (DWT), a measure for \ncargo carrying capacity. More than 80% of these ships are bulk \ncarriers, oil tankers, and container ships.\n\nThe EU Member State-registered fleet is relatively modern; \nhalf of all ships registered to EU Member State flags are less \nthan 15 years old, and therefore more likely to meet higher \nenvironmental standards. \n\nIn 2019, almost half of maritime traffic (ship calls) in the EU \ncame from vessels engaged exclusively in domestic routes and \nvoyages, mainly due to the frequent crossings made by roll-on \nroll-off passenger ships and ferries. EU ports handled close to \nfour billion tonnes of goods, accounting for around half of all \ngoods by weight traded between the EU-27 and the rest of the \nworld.\n\nEU and international environmental standards for maritime \ntransport:\n\nSince the late 1990s, the EU has adopted an increasingly \ncomprehensive body of rules which applies to ships trading in \nEU waters or sailing to or from EU ports. These laws, among \nothers, address environmental aspects like air emissions, such \nas the  Regulation on the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification \nof CO2  or the Sulphur Directive, and water pollution aspects \nsuch as  the Ship Source Pollution Directive and the Port \nReception Facilities Directive. In addition, the Marine Strategy \nFramework Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the \nHabitats Directive, protect the marine environment, aiming to \nuphold good environmental status standards and to reduce air \nand other pollution in coastal communities and ports.\n\nThese EU laws are coherent with the international framework, \nand some go beyond the environmental standards set by the \nInternational Maritime Organization.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO), has, since \nits foundation, adopted more than 50 international treaties \nregulating international shipping, of which 40% focus on \nenvironmental protection.\n\nGreenhouse gases: \n\nThe EU has proposed an EU-wide net greenhouse gas emissions \n(GHG) reduction target by 2030 of at least 55% (compared to \n1990) that will set the Union onto the path to climate neutrality.\n\nIn 2018, the maritime transport and inland navigation sector \ncontributed 13.5% of the EU\u2019s total transport greenhouse gas \nemissions; well behind road transport and slightly behind \naviation. \n\nBy far the largest type of greenhouse gas emissions created \nby the maritime transport sector was carbon dioxide (CO2 ) \nfrom the burning of fuel. In total, ships calling at EU and EEA \nports generated 140 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018 \n(approximately 18% of all CO2 emissions generated by maritime \ntransport worldwide that year). \n\nOf the total CO2 emissions, around 40% arise from ships \ntravelling between ports of EU Member States and ships at \nberth in ports. The remaining 60% is produced during voyages \ninto and out of the EU. Container ships alone account for \naround one third of the fleet CO2 emissions in the EU.\n\nRailways*\n0.5 %\n\nOther\n0.5 %\n\nMaritime and \ninland navigation\n\n13.5 %\n\nCivil aviation\n14.4 %\n\nRoad transport*\n71.0 %\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions all transport sectors\n\nNote: *excluding indirect emissions from electronic consumption.\n\nSource: 'EEA greenhouse gas \u2014 data viewer', European Environment \nAgency (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-andmaps/data/\ndata-viewers/greenhouse-gases-viewer)\n\f\n \n\n5Facts and figures: the EMTER report\n\nAir pollution:\n\nApproximately 40% of the EU population lives within 50 \nkilometres of the sea, so air emissions from ships are a \nparticular concern for coastal communities. Ships emit \nsubstances, including sulphur oxides (SOX), nitrogen oxides \n(NOX) and particulate matter (PM), which can affect human \nhealth. These emissions can be significant in areas of heavy \nmaritime traffic.\n\nIn 2018, the maritime transport sector produced 24% of all \nNOx emissions, 24% of all SOx emissions and 9% of all PM2.5 \nemissions (particle matter emissions with a diameter of less \nthan 2.5\u00b5m), as a proportion of national EU emissions from all \neconomic sectors:\n\n \nThe main sulphur oxides emissions from ships are sulphur \ndioxides (SO2). These emissions are generated by the use \nof marine fuels in engines on board vessels, but also by \nother combustion machinery, like oil-fired boilers. In 2019, \nSO2 emissions from ships calling in EU/European Economic \nArea (EEA) ports amounted to around 1.63 million tonnes; \napproximately 16% of the global SO2 emissions from \ninternational shipping. \n\nTo reduce SO2 emissions from ships, the sulphur content of \nmarine fuels has been regulated in the EU since 1999, and \ncontinuously reduced since then, with the EU Sulphur Directive \nleading to reductions in SOx concentrations in European seas. \nIn addition, in 2015, sulphur emission control areas (SECAs) \nwere introduced in the North and Baltic Seas, requiring ships \nto use fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 0.10% m/m in \nthese areas. The SECAs have proven to effectively contribute \nto a significant reduction in SO2 concentrations, reaching \nattenuations of up to 60%.\n\nAs of January 2021, NOx Emission Control Areas have been \napplied in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, although effective \nreductions are expected to materialise at a slow pace as the \nrequirements only apply to new ships.\n\nUnderwater noise:\n\nShips create noise as they pass through the water, from their \npropellers, machinery (including their engines) and from the \nmovement of their hulls. This noise can affect marine species \nin different ways; loss of hearing, reduction in communication, \na potential increase in stress levels, and various behavioural \nchanges are just some adverse effects on marine life caused by \nunderwater noise. Cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises and whales) \nare thought to be particularly affected, as they use sound to \ncommunicate between each other.\n\nIt is estimated that between 2014 and 2019, the total \naccumulated underwater radiated noise more than doubled \nin EU waters. Container ships, passenger ships, and tankers \ngenerate the highest noise emissions from propeller use.\n\nCurrently, underwater noise thresholds are being developed for \nthe EU under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.\n\nNon-indigenous species:\n\nNon-indigenous species are aquatic pathogens, which can \nbe transported from one habitat to another by ships either \nexternally (by clinging to the hulls of vessels, otherwise \nknown as hull fouling) or through ships\u2019 ballast water, which \nis fresh or salt water held in tanks to stabilize vessels and \nincrease manoeuvrability. If these species adapt to their new \nenvironment, they can create a threat to local biodiversity, \nhuman health and severely damage local economies.\n\nOverall, since 1949, the maritime transport sector has \naccounted for the largest proportion of non-indigenous species \nintroduced into seas around the EU \u2013 close to 50% of all species, \nwith the largest number found in the Mediterranean. 51 species \nare all classified as high impact, meaning that they can affect \necosystems and native species.\n\nHowever, the rate of new introductions has slowed down since \n2005, due to a combination of factors including increased \nawareness, the decreasing pool of potential non-indigenous \nspecies, effective policies, and new legislation.\n\nShipping Other Sources\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nNOx\n\nPM2.5\n\nSO2\n\nPercentage\n\nNote: SO2, sulphur dioxide.\n\nSource: 'Air pollutant emissions data viewer (Gothenbur Protocol, \nLRTAP Convention) 1990-2018', European Environment \nAgency (https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-andmaps/\ndashboards/air-pollutant-emissions-data-viewer-3).\n\f\n \n\n6 Facts and figures: the EMTER report\n\nOil pollution:\n\nOver the past 30 years, the amount of oil transported at sea has \nbeen steadily growing. However, the number of oil spills has \nbeen in decline. Between 2010 and 2019, out of 44 mediumsized oil spills (defined as spills of between 7-700 tonnes of \noil), only five were located in European seas. During the same \nperiod, only three large oil spills (involving more than 700 \ntonnes of oil) out of a total of 18 such spills, were located in the \nEU.\n\nThe trend is the same for smaller oil spills of less than 7 tonnes. \nIn 2019, a total of 7 939 possible such spills were identified \nvia satellite monitoring in EU waters, with 42% confirmed as \ndischarges of various sizes. However, despite an increase in the \narea covered by satellites, the average number of detections \nper million km2 has decreased, confirming a positive declining \ntrend in discharges.\n\nMarine litter:\n\nMarine litter can endanger fish and animals living in the oceans. \nIt can also damage ships and cause accidents at sea, and \nimpacts coastal communities when it washes up on shore.  \n\nOne of the ways in which litter reaches the marine ecosystem \nis through lost containers at sea, which can either split open, \ndischarging their contents, or can remain intact, causing a \nhazard for other ships. However, estimates suggest that the \npercentage of total waste released through lost containers at \nsea is negligible in the EU, with an average of 268 containers \nlost per year (i.e. one thousandth of 1% of 226 million packed \nand empty containers worldwide shipped on average annually).\n\nAnother way in which litter enters the oceans is through waste \ngenerated on-board ships. When vessels arrive at port, they \nunload the waste they produce at sea, in what are termed port \nreception facilities.  In 2018, a comparison between the amount \nof expected ship-generated waste and the waste that was \nactually delivered in port reception facilities in the EU provided \nan estimate of the amount of potential ship generated waste \nwhich could be illegally discharged at sea. This estimate ranged \nfrom around 2.5% for oily waste, 10% for sewage and 7\u201334% for \nrefuse (excluding plastic waste). \n\nTo tackle this discrepancy, the Directive regulating the \navailability of Port Reception Facilities and the delivery of \nwaste to those facilities was revised in 2019, with the aim of \nsubstantially reducing discharges of ship-generated waste and \ncargo residues into the sea.\n\nNavigating towards sustainability:\n\nEfforts have also focused on increasing energy efficiency, with \ndata revealing that most ships calling in the EU have reduced \ntheir speed up to approximately 20% compared to 2008, \nthereby also reducing emissions. In addition, non-traditional \nfuels and energy sources, such as biofuels, batteries, hydrogen \nor ammonia are emerging as possible alternatives for shipping, \nwith the potential to decarbonise the sector and lead to zero \nemissions.\n\nThe use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as ship fuel can \nsubstantially reduce the release of air pollutants like sulphur \noxide (SOx; a reduction of up to 90%), particulate matter (PM; a \nreduction of up to 90%) and nitrogen oxides (NOx; a reduction \nof up to 80%) compared to traditional fossil fuels. In 2020, a \n\f\n \n\n7Facts and figures: the EMTER report\n\nare expected to increase, which, combined with a projected \ndecrease in land-based source emissions, means that maritime \nnitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions will exceed land-based \nemissions after 2030. \n\nClimate change will have a major impact on the maritime \ntransport sector. Port infrastructure will need to adjust to \nexpected sea level rises due to climate change, and the melting \nof the earth\u2019s ice cap could fully open new routes, including the \nNorthern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage.\n\nWith nearly a fifth of the total world fleet, the EU faces a \ncrucial decade in which it needs to lead the transition to a \nmore economically, socially and environmentally sustainable \nmaritime transport sector. The implementation of the \nEuropean Green Deal\u2019s objectives, together with those of the \n2030 Biodiversity Strategy, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility \nStrategy, the proposed European Climate Law, the Farm to Fork \nStrategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan, will inevitably move \ntowards a reduction in the consumption of petroleum as well as \na reduction in the waste shipped out of the EU.\n\ntotal of 59 ports in the EU had LNG installations, totalling 71 \nfacilities. \n\nShips can also avail of onshore power supplies (OPS), which \nprovide a clean source of energy, in maritime and inland \nnavigation ports, where air quality is poor, or noise levels are \nhigh. In the EU, 9.60% of container ships, 15% of cruise ships \nand 10% of Ro-pax ships calling at ports are equipped with highvoltage OPS. 31 ports from 12 EU Member States have already \nimplemented high-voltage shore connection (36 shore-to-ship \npower supply facilities in total in the EU). \n\nImproved ship design and operation can contribute to reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions from ships. In 2018, the technical \nenergy efficiency of ships calling in EU/European Economic \nArea ports was generally comparable to that of the world fleet \n(except for small container ships). Most ships built after 2015 \nalready comply with energy efficiency standards applicable over \nthe period 2020-2025S\n\nFuture trends:\n\nOver the coming decades, international shipping is expected \nto grow. Transport volume for all ship categories is expected to \nincrease by 24% by 2050, and world trade is predicted to grow \nby 9% between 2030 and 2050.\n\nIn addition, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has \nestimated that the maritime sector\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \nwill increase to about 90-130% of 2008 emissions by 2050 for a \nrange of plausible long-term economic and energy scenarios.\n\nSulphur oxides (SOX) and particulate matter (PM) emissions \nfrom shipping are projected to drop substantially up to 2050. \nNevertheless, sea-based source nitrogen oxides emissions \n\f\f\nEuropean Environment Agency\n\nFacts and figures: the EMTER report\n2021 \u2014 7 pp. \u2014 21 x 29.7 cm\n\nGetting in touch with the EU\n\nIn person\nAll over the European Union there are hundreds of Europe Direct information centres.

water use in the Eastern Partnership countries8\n\nKey messages\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 Renewable freshwater resources are unevenly distributed throughout the six Eastern Partnership (EaP) \ncountries due to natural conditions. In 2017, Georgia (12 000 m3/capita) and Belarus (6 000 m3/capita) \nwere regarded as water-abundant countries, whereas Armenia (3 000 m3/capita) held sufficient renewable \nwater resources. The Republic of Moldova (1 800 m3/capita) and Azerbaijan (1 730 m3/capita) are prone to \nwater scarcity over the period 2000-2017. \n\n\u2022 In 2017, Armenia and Azerbaijan overexploited renewable freshwater resources for agriculture and public \nwater supply; the estimated water exploitation index was 61 % and 72 %, respectively. Due to ineffective \nwater demand management, both countries have experienced water scarcity for a long time. \n\n\u2022 Water pollution is not a new issue in the region, but will be exacerbated in future by intensified agriculture \nand industrialisation and urbanisation, particularly if these developments are not supported by improved \nwastewater treatment. The lack of financial resources or insufficient management of water resources will \nexacerbate the problem. \n\n\u2022 The main problem in rivers related to high concentrations of ammonium (NH4) and phosphate caused by \ndischarges of untreated or insufficiently treated wastewater and by agriculture. At two thirds of the river \nsites reported in the EaP countries the current concentration of ammonium is above the recommended \nlevels for cyprinid fish in the European Union (EU) Fish Directive. Phosphate concentrations have increased \nsince 2008. At present, almost half of the EaP river sites have phosphate concentrations which are high \nenough to cause eutrophication. \n\n\u2022 The pollution of surface waters has direct impact on the volume of groundwater abstracted by increasing \ndemand on groundwater resources, particularly in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. Overall, between \n2000-2017, the water abstraction from surface and groundwater increased by 32 % in Armenia and \n10 % in Azerbaijan. Water abstraction in Georgia has also increased by 20 % since 2005. In other EaP \ncountries, the water abstraction has relatively decreased due to decline of some economic sectors \n(e.g. agriculture in Moldova) or water-use efficiency (e.g. in Belarus). \n\n\u2022 Aged water-conveyance systems cause high water losses and spillover effects on increasing water \nabstraction for public water supplies. In 2017, the water-conveyance system in Armenia caused 79 % water \nloss in the public water supply. Similarly, 63 % of water was lost in the Georgian water-conveyance system, \n49 % in Moldova, and 48 % in Azerbaijan, whereas Belarus, with only 18 % of water losses, registers the \nhighest conveyance efficiency among the EaP countries.\n\n\u2022 The EaP countries have improved their economy by generating gross domestic products between two to \nfour times higher since 2000. However, only Belarus achieved absolute decoupling between water use \nand increase in gross domestic product. In 2017, Belarus used 8 m3 of water to produce one unit of gross \ndomestic product whereas Armenia used 79 m3, Azerbaijan 58 m3, Moldova 43 m3 and Georgia 39 m3 for \nthe same unit of product. \n\n\u2022 Knowledge-based policymaking still remains a key objective for the EaP countries, at least in the water \nsector, which should be supported by improving monitoring programmes and development of systematic \ncapacity building in using available data and information for the national experts. This may also stimulate \nthe effectiveness of cooperation and collaboration in the context of transboundary large river basins. \n\f\nKey messages\n\n9Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\n\u2022 Within the framework of the European Neighourhood Policy (ENP) , all partners have committed to achieve \ntangible benefits to the livelihood of the citizens across the region by focusing on achieving 20 deliverables \nfor 2020, including in the field of the environment. Furthermore, the Association Agreements between \nthe EU and Georgia, Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, as well as the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and \nEnhanced Partnership Agreement support, among others, the alignment of national water legislation \nwith the EU and international standards. When achieved, significant progress will be registered in the \nprotection and integrated management of water resources in the region. \n\n\u2022 Countries are still facing several important institutional and managerial challenges. Specifically, attention \nshould be paid to the establishment and functioning of river basin councils, the development of \nstakeholder models and practices and public involvement, the development of a sustainable funding \nmechanism for implementing the River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) and the production of robust and \nreliable data. At the regional level, bilateral and multilateral cooperation on transboundary basins should \nbe strengthened both within the region and with EU Member States and other countries.\n\nhttps://eeas.europa.eu/diplomatic-network/european-neighbourhood-policy-enp_en\f\nWater availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries10\n\nExecutive summary\n\nAction on environment and climate goals has received \nsignificant attention within the Eastern Partnership \n(EaP) initiative. As a specific regional dimension of \nthe European Neighbourhood Policy, the EaP aims \nto strengthen and deepen the political and economic \nrelations between the EU, its Member States and the \nsix partner countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, \nGeorgia; the Republic of Moldova (herein after \nreferred to as Moldova), and Ukraine. The EaP is also \ngeared towards delivering on global commitments, \nincluding the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and \nthe UN (UN SDGs) 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\n\nLong-lasting efforts have been made within the \nEaP framework to improve the evidence base for \nenvironmental decision-making in line with the European \nCommission's\tCommunication\t'Towards\ta\u00a0Shared\t\nEnvironmental\tInformation\tSystem\t(SEIS)'.\tIn\u00a02011,\tthe\t\nEU initiated a project on SEIS implementation in EaP \ncountries, which has seen two phases up to 2020. This \ndemand-based project, implemented by the European \nEnvironment Agency (EEA), has supported EaP countries \nin accessing EU and European Environment Information \nand Observation Network (Eionet) knowledge and \nexperience. Water was one of the priority thematic areas \nof cooperation. \n\nThis report is one of the results of the implementation \nof Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) \nprinciples\tin\tEaP\tcountries.\tIt\tpresents\ta\u00a0regional\t\nassessment of freshwater availability and wateruse efficiency based on seven selected United \nNations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) \nwater indicators chosen in agreement with the EaP \ncountries. The selection of the indicators was mainly \ndriven by data availability across all EaP countries. \nSince the selected indicators are only capable of \naddressing limited issues concerning the protection \nof water resources and sustainable and integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM) by the EaP \ncountries at the regional level, this report does not \naddress all environmental impacts of pressures and \nthe effectiveness of policy responses (measures) \nin\tthe\u00a0water\tarea.\tPrimarily,\tat\tthe\tregional\tlevel,\t\nit quantifies trends and current renewable water \nresources, water use by economic sector, economic \n\nwater use efficiency, efficiency of the water-supply \nindustry and the pollution of surface water.  \n\nFrom the hydrological perspective, all large rivers \nin\tthe\u00a0EaP\tcountries,\tfor\texample,\tVistula,\tNeman,\t\nDaugava, Danube, Dnieper, Dniester, Prut, Aras and \nKura, are either transboundary or share a basin, \nincluding with EU Member States. Three indicators have \nbeen used for the regional assessment of renewable \nfreshwater resources (RWR) over the years: RWR per \ncapita; dependency ratio; and water stress. Georgia \nholds the highest RWR per capita on average with \n13\u00a0500\u00a0m3/capita/year, whereas Moldova has the \nlowest\tat\t1\u00a0800\tm3/capita/year.

Azerbaijan's dependency ratio is greater than \n70\u00a0%.\tIn\tBelarus,\tit\tis\taround\t38\u00a0%.\tThere\tis\tinsufficient\t\ninformation available for estimating the recharge, \nstorage and discharge of groundwater in aquifers that \nare lying between countries. \n\nEven though the annual RWR per capita in the region \nindicates there is no water stress, Armenia and \nAzerbaijan are facing severe water-scarcity conditions \ndue to over-abstraction of freshwater for agriculture \nand a high rate of water losses in water.

Three quarters of the river-monitoring sites \nanalysed have very high ammonium concentrations, \nand biological oxygen demand (BOD) is very high \nat one quarter of these sites. The average BOD \nhas\tonly\u00a0decreased\tslightly\tsince\t2008\tand\twas\t\nat\t2.7\u00a0mg\tO2/l in 2017.

Average river phosphate \nconcentrations have also increased slightly since 2008. \n\nWhere indicated, there is usually a significant difference \nbetween river water quality up and downstream \nof cities and towns, with higher concentrations \ndownstream of cities. Increasing concentrations were \nalso observed, to a larger extent, for sites downstream \nof settlements. \n\nPoor surface water quality in many EaP countries is an \nindication that groundwater resources are at a high risk \nof being more polluted and more exploited. Since 2000, \nthis trend has already caused a fourfold increase in \nwater abstraction from groundwater in Azerbaijan and \nthreefold in Armenia. \n\n(1)  An international dollar would buy a comparable amount of goods and services in the cited country as a US dollar would buy in the United \nStates. This term is often used in conjunction with PPP data (World Bank, 2017b).\n\f\nExecutive summary\n\n12 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nThere is still a problem with data availability in many of \nthe countries. For example, we could not determine the \nstate of groundwater quality in most of the countries \nbecause data on the measured quality parameters \nare not freely available or are not collected in uniform \nnational information databases. There is also a poor \nunderstanding of the importance of comprehensive \nassessments of water quality state, pressures and \nimpacts. When data are available for selected water \nlocations, they are not interpreted or integrated into \nregular water management purposes. \n\nWith EU support, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia \nhave developed water information systems as a pilot \nactivity by replicating the overall approach of the Water \nInformation System for Europe (WISE). This will ensure \nthe effective sharing of data and information among \n\nwater agencies, while improving the capacities of these \ncountries to respond to regional and international \nreporting commitments. In this context, sustainability \nand further improvements within the existing \ninformation systems are vital. \n\nIn future, the sharing of available data and information \namong\tnational\twater\tagencies,\tas\u00a0well\u00a0as\twith\t\nexternal stakeholders, will be key, along with \nintegrating all data relevant to managing water \nresources. Enhancing countries' monitoring capacities \nis\tequally\timportant.\tThis\twill\tprovide\ta\u00a0robust\tbaseline\t\nfor developing and implementing water-focused \nenvironmental policies, not only at the national level \nbut\talso\tat\tthe\tregional\tlevel\t\u2014\u00a0an\u00a0essential\tprocess\t\nin improving cooperation among transboundary river \nbasins. \n\f\n13\n\nContext, scope and methodology\n\nWater availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nThe EaP sets out a path for the EU to follow to deepen \nits relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, \nGeorgia, Moldova and Ukraine through bilateral and \nmultilateral cooperation. Since its establishment in \n2009, cooperation between the EU and EaP countries \nhas resulted in significant achievements. For example, \nEU support has enabled modern water policy at basin \nlevel\tconcerning\tmore\tthan\t30\u00a0million\tpeople\tacross\t\nthe six partner countries. Since 2017, four river basins \nplans have been adopted in line with EU benchmarks. \nAll the countries have received modern equipment to \nbetter monitor and reduce their populations' exposure \nto water pollutants.\n\nEnvironment and climate action is gaining prominence \nwithin the EaP. The recent Communication on the \nEaP 'Reinforcing Resilience \u2013 an Eastern Partnership \nthat delivers for all' lists environmental and climate \nresilience among its five priorities. The proposed \nagenda aims to: (1) scale up action in areas that are \ncritical for people's health and well-being; (2) increase \neconomies' resource efficiency; (3) develop new green \njobs and economic opportunities linked to the green \ntransition; (4) develop local and renewable sources of \nenergy; and (5) manage natural assets to maximise \nsustainability. The EaP also aims to support progress \non the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and \nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change (EC,, 2020a). \n\nThe Eastern Partnership Ministerial Meetings on \nEnvironment and Climate Change provide a policy \nplatform where the EaP countries and the EU jointly \nreview\tprogress\ton\tthe\u00a0goals\tand\tpriorities\tin\tvarious\t\nenvironmental domains. \n\nAs a specific Eastern dimension of the European \nNeighourhood Policy, the EaP combines bilateral \nand multilateral tracks. The overall framework \nguiding relations between the EU and its six Eastern \nPartners is provided by relevant bilateral agreements, \nsuch as the Association Agreements, as well as the \nAssociation Agendas, the Partnership Priorities, \nand\tthe\tEaP\t20\u00a0Deliverables\tfor\t2020\taligned\tacross\t\nfour key priority areas: (1) stronger economy; (2) \nstronger governance; (3) stronger connectivity, \nenergy efficiency, environment and climate action; \nand (4) stronger society, together with targets for the \ncross-cutting issues of gender, civil society and strategic \ncommunication.\n\nThe Association Agreements between the EU and \nGeorgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the EU-Armenia \nComprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement \n(European Commission, 2020a) accelerate a gradual \nimprovement in national water legislation, including \nalignment with the EU's water law, where relevant. \nNegotiations between the EU and Azerbaijan on \n\n1 Context, scope and methodology\n\nKey messages\n\nThis report was developed in the context of the EEA cooperation with the Eastern partnership region.  \n\nThe report primarily aims to present regional information and assessment from the aggregated results of \nenvironmental indicators for the water sector with the aim of supporting knowledge-based policymaking at \nthe regional level. Problems arising on the quality and quantity of water resources have already become more \nacute in almost all EaP countries' transboundary river basins, calling for joint actions among the countries.\n\nThe methodology used to develop the indicators is built on key elements from the EEA's work with its Eionet \npartner network, in full recognition of the different set-ups concerning interactions with partner countries in \nthe EaP region.\n\nBy its very nature, the report is indicator based and its content is confined only by the selected indicators \nagreed with the EaP countries.

As the State \nStatistics Service of Ukraine does not have a mandate \nfor collecting water quantity data, Ukraine's freshwaters \nare not covered by water quantity assessments. \nHowever, this report addresses water quantity in \nUkraine to a limited extent, based on data available \nonline in different national or international domains \nto\u00a0ensure\ta\tproper\tregionally\thorizontal\tassessment.\t\n\n1.2 Methodological approach\n\nAn indicator is a measure, generally quantitative, that \ncan be used to illustrate and communicate complex \nphenomena simply, including trends and progress \nover time (EEA, 2005). The EEA designs, develops and \nupdates a number of water indicators as part of a core \nset of indicators to inform EU and national institution \npolicymakers (4). \n\nThe establishment and development of the EEA \ncore\tset\u00a0of\tindicators\tfollow\ta\tcertain\tstructure\tand\t\ntemplate to ensure transparency from monitoring \nto data collection and knowledge creation. As this \nset of indicators can also be positioned with the \nso-called DPSIR framework (5), the indicators selected \nwithin the scope of this report were also designed \naround\tthe\tkey\u00a0elements\tof\tthe\tEEA\tDPSIR\tframework\t\n(Figure\u00a01.2).\u00a0They\twere\tdeveloped\tjointly\twith\tnational\t\n\nwater experts from the EaP countries, and EaP \ncountries and partners of the European Union Water \nInitiative Plus (EUWI+) consortium (6) were consulted \non\u00a0all\tindicators\tbefore\tthey\twere\tpublished\t(7). \n\nHowever, the selected indicators are capable of \naddressing limited issues concerning the protection \nof water resources and sustainable, integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) in EaP countries at the \nregional level. EaP countries face various challenges, \nsuch as political, administrative, financial, technical \nand human capacities in protecting and managing the \nwater resources, which are not fully addressed in this \nreport. The added value of this report is primarily to \nquantify the magnitude of and trends in the pollution \nof surface water, renewable freshwater resources, and \nwater use by economic sectors. The report presents a \nregional overview with up-to-date data and information \nmainly provided by the EaP countries. Nevertheless, \naddressing all the environmental impacts of pressures \nand the effectiveness of the policy responses \n(measures) remain out of the scope of this report \nbecause of its inherent structure. \n\nWater quality is more or less a common issue across \nEaP countries due to high emissions from agriculture \nand the discharge of untreated wastewater into \nthe environment. Within the scope of this report, \nBOD5 and ammonium concentration in rivers and \nnutrients in freshwater are two indicators selected \n\n(4)  See all EEA core set and thematic indicators at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/#c0=30&c12-operator=or&b_start=0\n(5)  DPSIR stands for 'Drivers \u2013 Pressures \u2013 State \u2013 Impact \u2013 Response, which has been used by the EEA as a conceptual framework for data flow \n\nand undertaking the assessment.\n(6)  EUWI+ is the largest EU-funded project running in the EaP countries to help Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine \n\nbring their legislation closer to EU policy in the field of water management, development and implementation of pilot RBMPs, building on the \nimproved policy framework and ensuring the strong participation of local stakeholders: https://euwipluseast.eu/en/\n\n(7)  The full set of indicators can be seen at: https://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/east/countries/\n\nhttps://eni-seis.eionet.europa.eu/east/indicators\f\nContext, scope and methodology\n\n17Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nFigure 1.2  Thematic coverage of the selected indicators in line with the DPSIR framework\n\nNote:  Light-blue boxes indicate those areas covered by the selected indicators in the report.\n\nSource:  Slightly\tmodified\tfrom\t(Collins\tet\tal.,\t2009).\n\nClimate \nchange \n\nN\naturalfactors\n\nPrecipitation\n\nEvapotranspiration\n\nTemperature\n\nHydro-climate cycle\n\nNatural\nwater\n\nbalance\n\nDrought-net\nprecipitation\n\ndeficit\n\nWater exploitation index\n\nThe Environment Mitigation measures\n\nClimate change mitigation\n- Decreasing GHG  emmissions\n- Increasing GHG removals etc.(e.g. \nin line with IPCC and Paris agreement) \n\nDemand management\n- Water saving\n- Increasing efficiency \n- Water pricing\n- Information campaigns\n- Water restrictions\n- Reducing leakage\n\nSupply management\n- Increasing storage (reservoirs,\ngroundwater recharge)\n- Water reuse\n- Desalination\n- Water transfers\n\nIntegrated water management\n- River basin management plans \n(e.g. the EU WFD RBMPs)\n- Food risk management plans\n- Drought risk management plans\n\nResponseImpactStatePressureDriving force\n\nEconomy Adaptation  measures\n\nN\naturalfactors\n\nAgriculture\n\nHouseholds\n\nIndustrial production\n\nPower plants\n\nOthers\n\nW\nater abstraction for\n\nAgriculture Over abstraction\n\nSalt water intrusion\n\nLow river flows\n\nLow reservoir levels\n\nLoss of wetlands\n\nWater pollution\n\nDecreasing \ngroundwater levels\n\nAdverse ecological \neffects\n\nPublic water supply\n\nIndustry\n\nEnergy\n\nOthers\n\nto address water-quality issues in both surface water \nand groundwater.

Surface and \ngroundwater resources are strategic natural resources \nfor\tsupplying\twater\tto\t70\u00a0million\tpeople\tand\tkey\tto\t\nmaintaining the countries' major economic sectors, \nsuch as agriculture, energy and manufacturing \nindustries.\n\nHowever, in some countries, renewable water \nresources are either overexploited by economic sectors \n(e.g. in Armenia and Azerbaijan) or polluted by highlevel nitrate and phosphorus (P) emissions (excluding \nBelarus), mainly from agriculture and the direct \ndischarge of wastewater. One third of the population at \nthe regional level do not have access to a public water \nsupply. In some countries, almost half of the population \nrely on self-supply. In addition, direct discharge or \ninsufficiently treated wastewater exacerbates the \npollution of surface and groundwater resources. These \nproblems, either partly or entirely, are common in \nall EaP countries and have already been addressed \nin several publications (EEA, 2011; OECD and UNECE, \n2014; UNECE, 2007c; UNENGO, 2015). \n\n2 Policy context of water resources \nmanagement in Eastern Partnership \ncountries\n\nIn 2014, by signing agreements with the EU and its \nMember States, Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine started \nthe gradual adjustment of their national legislation \nto European environmental standards and principles, \nwhile some other countries, for example, Belarus, have \nvoluntarily aimed to harmonise their water legislation \nwith the EU water acquis.\n\nMany of the existing national water laws are adopting \nprinciples similar to the EU water acquis, particularly \nthe EU Water Framework Directive and its daughter \nDirectives. For example, Water Law no. 272/2011 in \nMoldova has partly harmonised its water legislation \nwith the EU water acquis (Republic of Moldova, 2011) on \nthe protection of water against nitrate pollution from \nagricultural sources, bathing waters, environmental \nquality standards in the field of water policy, and on \nurban wastewater treatment. In Ukraine, the process \nof implementing European water policy started with \nthe new legislation, namely, the Water Code of Ukraine \n(amended on 4 October 2016). The Code sets the \nbasis for implementation of extended water-quality \nmonitoring programmes, for example to support the \nassessment of the ecological status of surface-water \nbodies. Georgia adopted new water legislation in 1997, \nand is currently reforming its national environmental \nlegislation and water protection sector to adapt to the \nEU water acquis (Vystavna et al., 2018). Meanwhile, \nsome countries are renewing their water legislation and \nwater strategy, with EU support, such as Azerbaijan. \n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan also participate in the \nEuropean Nieghbourhood Policy. Political cooperation \nbetween the EU and Armenia is based on the \n\nKey messages\n\nBilateral cooperation is already taking place for integrated water resources management in the transboundary \nriver basins, such as the Dniester Treaty between Moldova and Ukraine, and the bilateral agreement between \nBelarus and Ukraine.\n\nAll EaP countries have governmental organisations to manage water resources. However, frequent \nreorganisation among the respective agencies and ministries and staff turnover create risks as regards \ndeveloping expert knowledge and the operational capacity of water institutions.\n\f\nPolicy context of water resources management in Eastern Partnership countries\n\n19Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nComprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement \n(CEPA)\twhich\twas\tsigned\ton\t24\u00a0November\t2017.\tWith\t\nthis agreement, the EU started to support Armenia in \nadopting EU environmental standards and updating the \nWater Code of Armenia as part of the implementation \nof EUWI+ activities. Political cooperation between the \nEU and Azerbaijan began in 1999 with signature of the \nPartnership and Cooperation Agreement (EC, 1999).\n\nThe EU provides financial and technical support for \na\u00a0number\tof\tinternational\tprojects\tin\tthe\tregion,\taiming\t\nto strengthen the capacities of the governmental and \npublic administration bodies in monitoring, water \ninformation systems, water supply, sanitation, river \nbasin management, the protection of freshwater \necosystems, and public participation. For instance, the \nEUWI+ and SEIS II East are projects funded through \nthe European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), and \n\nare active in all six countries. The EUWEI+ focuses on \nthe consolidation of monitoring systems and supports \nfurther reforms of water policies and the development \nof RBMPs in all six countries with the involvement of \nstakeholders and the wider public. The ENI SEIS II East \nproject supports capacity building for an integrated \nassessment of the state of environment and data \nreporting to international bodies.\n\n2.1 Cooperation in transboundary \nbasins and EU water diplomacy \n\nCooperation in transboundary river basins plays a \nsignificant role in ensuring the sustainable use of \nwater resources by EaP countries.

It provides internationally recognised norms for measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of \nsustainable development. The status of ratification of the Water Convention by the EaP countries is given in Table 2.1: \n\nArmenia and Georgia have not yet acceded to the Water Convention. Despite some legacy bilateral agreements existing \namong the Caucasus countries in the Soviet era before 1991, it is not clear how relevant they are now in practice \n(Yildiz, 2017).

However, financial constraints, the \nreluctance among national water agencies to facilitate \ndata and information exchange and, in some cases, \nthe loss of institutional memory due to the frequent \nreorganisation of the water agencies, staff turnover \nand repeatedly changing governments with varying \npolitical priorities, present limitations for underpinning \nknowledge-based policymaking in the water domain. \nAll these acute problems require the commitment from \nand participation of all riparian and upstream countries. \n\nGiven\tthat\ttransboundary\tbasins\tcover\taround\t60\u00a0%\t\nof the EU's territory (EC, 2019a), Member States have \na vast experience of cooperation in such basins. EU \nwater diplomacy calls for enhancing EU diplomatic \nengagement on water and facilitating the prevention, \ncontainment and resolution of conflicts, contributing to \nthe equitable, sustainable and integrated management \nof water resources, as well as promoting resilience to \n\nclimate change impacts on water (EC, 2018). In this \ncontext, the EU reiterates the need for full compliance \nwith international environmental safety standards \nwhile developing projects in EU neighbouring countries \nwhich impact on transboundary water resources.\n\n2.2 United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Agenda 2030 \n\nAll countries have taken action to affirm their \ncommitment to attaining the United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and are \ntherefore actively involved in international policies \nfor environmental protection and sustainable \ndevelopment. The main UN platform for joint and \nharmonised international actions for UN SDGs at the \nglobal level is the United Nations High-level Political \nForum on Sustainable Development (UNHLPF, 2020). \nSince 2015, all six countries have actively worked with \nthe HLPF and are creating the necessary national \ninfrastructure for implementation of the UN SDGs, also \nin the area of water. Two political goals most frequently \nreferred to in the region concern drinking water supply \nand sustainable water use.\n\nWithin the EU Water Diplomacy initiative, the EU \npromote accession to and implementation of \ninternational agreements on water cooperation: in \nparticular, UNECE Convention on the Protection and \nUse of Transboundary Watercourses and International \n\f\nPolicy context of water resources management in Eastern Partnership countries\n\n22 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nLakes (Helsinki Water Convention 1992), the United \nNations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational \nUses of International Watercourses (UN, 1997), and \nother relevant international agreements (EC, 2018). \n\nEaP countries also implement joint activities with \nbilateral and multiparty agreements (UNECE, 2007c; \nFAO,\t2009;\tY\u0131ld\u0131z,\t2017).\tSome\thave\talready\tdeveloped\t\njoint monitoring systems, exchange information, and \nimplement activities on water pollution prevention \nand control, and water flow regulation in international \nriver basins.

There is also a bilateral \nagreement between Belarus and Ukraine on the joint \nuse and protection of transboundary waters, which \nentered into force on 13 June 2002. \n\nArmenia and Georgia, and Azerbaijan and Georgia \nalso engage in bilateral dialogue towards achieving \nan agreement for managing water resources in the \ninternational basins of the River Kura (FAO, 2009; \nY\u0131ld\u0131z,\u00a02017;\tYu\tet\tal.,\t2014).\t\n\nRecently, Azerbaijan and Georgia have been working \non developing a bilateral agreement on transboundary \nwater cooperation (UNECE, 2015) with a special focus \non flood prevention and wastewater management. \n\nBox 2.2  Dniester Treaty \n\nA bilateral treaty on 'Cooperation in the Field of Protection and Sustainable Development of the Dniester River Basin', \nby\u00a0the\tMinistry\tof\tEnvironment\tof\tMoldova\tand\tthe\tMinistry\tof\tEcology\tand\tNatural\tResources\tof\tUkraine,\twas\tsigned\t\nin\u00a0the\u00a0Italian\tParliament\ton\t29\tNovember\t2012\tin\tthe\tframework\tof\tthe\tHigh-level\tSegment\tof\tthe\tsixth\tsession\tof\tthe\t\nMeeting of the Parties to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on the Protection and \nUse\u00a0of\u00a0Transboundary\tWatercourses\tand\tInternational\tLakes\t(Water\tConvention).\t\n\nUnder the Treaty, the Dniester Commission was established with the main goal of implementing measures to achieve the \nrational and environmentally sound use and protection of water and other natural resources and ecosystems of the river \nbasin.

In this context, water \ngovernance at all levels is essential for long-term \nstability. It requires appropriate institutions, reliable \ndata, capacity building, awareness raising and funding. \nIt should foster sustainable, durable, climate-resilient \nwater management as well as consideration of the \ninterlinkages between water, energy, food security and \necosystems (EC, 2018). \n\nThere are governmental authorities responsible for \nwater management and environmental protection in \nall EaP countries. Overall, ministries of environment \nare the main governmental bodies responsible for \ndeveloping water management policy and legislation. \nWithin these ministries are dedicated institutions \nfor monitoring, analysing and disseminating data \nand information on water quality and quantity. \nIn\u00a0most\tcountries,\tthese\tare\thydrometeorological\t\nand geological services. Some countries have also \nestablished special information centres engaged in \n\nhttps://www.unece.org/env/water/mop6/dniester.html\f\n \n\n23Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nenvironmental protection and/or natural resources \nmanagement that can be sponsored by international \nprogrammes. Their overall function is to disseminate \ninformation to the public at large. They are typically \ninvolved in projects as the operators of information \nsystems or web portals suitable for publishing \nindicators. \n\nIn all EaP countries, there are additional agencies \nthat manage water supply and use, some of which \nare oriented towards implementing monitoring \nprogrammes of hydrometeorological and geological \n\nservices. In some countries, they are organised as \njoint-stock companies. The ministries of environment \nare supported by other ministries, for example: \nMinistry of Emergency Situations; Ministry of Health; \nMinistry of Regional Development; Ministry of Housing \nand Utility Services; and Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nNevertheless, frequent reorganisation within the \nrespective national agencies and ministries and staff \nturnover create risks for the sustainability of expert \nknowledge and operational capacity of the water \ninstitutions. \n\f\nWater availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries24\n\nRenewable water resources under the changing climate\n\nWater is a cross-cutting area in the context of climate \nchange impacts. There is growing evidence that climatic \nchanges in recent decades have already affected the \nglobal hydrological cycle, for example, through changes \nin seasonal river flows (EEA, 2017). In addition, human \nand economic activities exacerbate the impacts of \nclimate change, and climate change poses an additional \nthreat to the flow regime of water ecosystems \n(EEA,\u00a02012a).\tAccording\tto\tprojections,\tannual\taverage\t\nland temperature across Europe will rise in the \nrange\tof\t1.0\u00a0\u00b0C\tto\t4.5\u00a0\u00b0C\tby\tthe\tend\tof\tthis\tcentury\t\n(2071-2100\u00a0compared\tto\t1971-2000)\t(EEA,\t2019).\t\nProjections indicate that water availability will continue \nto decline, particularly in southern Europe, under \nthe\tscenario\tof\t1.5-2\u00a0oC\tglobal\twarming\taccording\tto\t\npre-industrial levels (Bisselink et al., 2020). \n\nAccording to recent assessments, the soil-moisture \nconditions in the Dinester Basin might change because \nof rising temperatures, especially in the winter months. \nThis trend would be associated with increasing \ntemporal variations of drought and heavy precipitation \nat the seasonal scale (Krakovskaya et al., 2012). \n\nAvailable studies indicate rising precipitation and \nhumidity in the highlands of the Caucasus, whereas \nthe frequency and magnitude of drought and warmer \n\n3 Renewable water resources under \nthe\u00a0changing climate\n\nsummers in the lowlands, such as southern Armenia, \ncentral Azerbaijan and eastern Georgia, are increasing \n(Rucevska, 2017; Elizbarashvili et al., 2017; Toropov \net al., 2019). This trend will be exacerbated by the \ndrastic melting of glaciers in the Caucasus due to rising \ntemperatures, thereby causing a reduction in the area of \nglaciation\tof\tup\tto\t0.69\u00a0%\tper\tyear\t(Toropov\tet\tal.,\t2019).\t\n\nThe EU's recent policy initiative, the European Green \nDeal, addresses climate change and water stress in the \ncontext of moving to a circular economy and becoming \nclimate neutral (EC, 2019b). It should be underlined that \nthe EU Water Diplomacy initiative promotes sustainable \nand IWRM as a response to climate change adaptation \nand resilience of the environment (EC, 2018). \n\nRenewable water resources are generated and \nreplenished by precipitation and the inflow of surface \nand groundwater from neighbouring countries \nthroughout the hydrological year. Net precipitation \n(internal flow as the difference between precipitation \nand actual evapotranspiration) replenishes surface \nrun-off to rivers, lakes and recharge groundwater \naquifers. Surface waters and groundwater flowing from \nneighbouring countries (external inflow or inflow from \nupstream countries) is an important part of renewable \nwater resources (UNECE, 2020a). \n\nKey messages\n\nOverall,\tannual\trenewable\tfreshwater\tresources\tper\tcapita\tis\tabove\t1\t700\u00a0m3 in EaP countries (no data \navailable for Ukraine) indicating no actual water stress.

In some \ncountries, water is considered to be abundant, while \nothers face severe water shortages throughout the \nyear. Similarly, there are also regional variations in \nRWR within each individual country. Three relevant \nindicators are used in this analysis to address RWR in \nEaP countries: water availability per capita; water stress \nlevel; and dependency ratio. \n\n3.1 Water availability per capita \n\nThe Falkenmark indicator (Falkenmark et al., 1989; \nBrown and Matlock, 2011)ie countries for which there \nare fluctuations between a dry season and a season \nwhen rain occurs. The paper discusses the general \nvulnerability of the semi-arid zone in terms of four \ndifferent types of water scarcity, the effects of which \nare being superimposed on each other: two are natural \n(type A, arid climate, type B, intermittent drought years \nsets\t1\u00a0700\tm3/per capita/year of water availability as the \nthreshold for water stress. Those countries with above \n1\u00a0700\tm3/per capita/year of RWR are regarded as not \nbeing under water stress. In that context, in 2017, none \nof the EaP countries, excluding Ukraine where no data \n\nis available for assessment, were considered as water \nstress countries (Figure 3.1). \n\nOn average, Georgia holds the highest RWR per capita \nwith\t13\u00a0500\u00a0m3/capita/year, whereas Moldova has \nthe\tlowest\tat\t1\u00a0800\u00a0m3/capita \u2013 only slightly above the \nFalkenmark indicator threshold of water stress. However, \nthis\tassessment\tneeds\tto\tbe\tinterpreted\twith\u00a0caution\tdue\t\nto uncertainty over the data on Moldova's RWR. \n\nEach country presents different internal and external \ndynamics of RWR over the years. As the indicator is \naffected by changes in total population and climate \nconditions both inside and outside the countries' \nterritories,\tthe\ttrend\tof\tthis\tindicator\tprovides\ta\u00a0very\t\nmixed overview across the countries. With the exception \nof Azerbaijan, there is a declining or stable trend in total \npopulation in all countries. \n\nThe\tArmenian\tpopulation\tdeclined\tby\t8\u00a0%\tbetween\t\n2000-2018 which, coupled with higher precipitation, \nincreased\tRWR\tper\tcapita\tfrom\t1\u00a0000\u00a0m3/capita/year \nin\u00a0the\tearly\t2000s\tto\t2\u00a0211\u00a0m3/capita/year in 2018. \n\nAzerbaijan presents a very dynamic population trend, \nwith\ta\tremarkable\tincrease\tof\t22\u00a0%\tbetween\t2000-2017.\t\nOver the same period, internal flow and inflow of water \n\nNote:  Data provided under the ENI SEIS II East project.

As a result, RWR per \ncapita\tdramatically\tdecreased\tby\t40\u00a0%\tin\tthe\tcountry\t\nbetween 2000-2017. \n\nThe population dynamics in Georgia have remained \nstable over the last decade (2008-2017). Whilst Georgia \nhas the highest RWR per capita in the region, it seems \nthat climate conditions are impacting this, showing \na\u00a06\u00a0%\tfall\tper\tcapita\tbetween\t2008-2017.\t\n\nBelarus also shows a strong correlation between \npopulation decrease and RWR increase per capita: \nbetween 2000-2017, the population decreased \nby\u00a07\u00a0%\u00a0and\tRWR\tper\tcapita\tincreased\tby\t8\u00a0%.\n\nSince 2000, there has been no significant change either \nin the total population of Moldova or in RWR per capita. \nTotal\tpopulation\tin\tthe\tcountry\thas\tfallen\tby\t1.4\u00a0%\t\nwhile\tRWR\tper\tcapita\tincreased\taround\t1.3\u00a0%\tbetween\t\n2000-2017. \n\nTaking into account both natural and man-made factors \ninfluencing RWR in the EaP countries, a declining trend \nin RWR might be expected in the near future, which \nwould exacerbate shortages in both seasonal and \nannual water supplies. \n\n3.2 Water stress conditions in EaP \ncountries \n\nComparing water availability against demand is another \nstrong indicator used to identify the level of water \nstress caused by man-made factors such as agriculture, \nindustry, households, energy, etc. Overall, water stress \noccurs when demand for water exceeds a certain level \nof\twater\tavailability:\tabove\t20\u00a0%\tindicates\tmoderate\t\nwater\tstress\twhereas\t40\u00a0%\tand\tmore\tindicates\tsevere\t\nwater scarcity conditions and unsustainable water \nresources management (Raskin et al., 1997). Changes in \nnatural conditions, such as decreasing precipitation or \nincreasing evapotranspiration may negatively influence \nthe availability of RWR. Similarly, man-made factors, \nsuch as changing land cover/land use or increasing \nwater demand, might also increase the water stress \nlevel. The Water Exploitation Index (WEI) is applied \nas a strong measure of the level of water stress. The \nWEI, or withdrawal ratio, is defined as the annual \ntotal abstraction of freshwater divided by the annual \nfreshwater resources. \n\nApplication of the WEI indicates that Armenia \nand Azerbaijan have been experiencing severe \nwater-scarcity conditions (Map 3.1). \n\nThe estimated WEI for Armenia and Azerbaijan \nindicate 'unsustainable' levels of water stress. \nIn\u00a0fact,\talthough\tArmenia\thas\tsufficient\trenewable\t\nwater resources per capita, the over-abstraction of \nfreshwater for agriculture, for example, fish farming \nfrom groundwater resources and the high rate of water \nlosses\tin\ttransport,\thave\traised\tthe\twater\tstress\u00a0level.\t\nBetween 2000-2017, the annual renewable freshwater \nresource\tin\tthe\tcountry\twas\u00a0around\t6\u00a0670\u00a0million\u00a0m3, \ncorresponding\tto\t2\u00a0189\u00a0m3/capita/year. However, \ndue to poor water management practices (e.g. high \nwater losses and leakages), it has been facing severe \nwater stress conditions for a long time. The average \nannual\tWEI\u00a0has\tconstantly\tbeen\tabove\t40\u00a0%,\twhen\tin\t\n2017\tit\twas\t61.4\u00a0%.\tThat\tmeans\tthat\talmost\ttwo\tthirds\t\nof all RWR in Armenia were abstracted to meet the \ncountry's water demands. Despite the total population \nof\tArmenia\tdeclining\taround\t8\u00a0%\tbetween\t2000-2017,\t\nwater\tdemand\tincreased\tby\t4.5\u00a0%\tover\tthe\tsame\t\nperiod. Ageing and inefficiency in the water distribution \nsystem has put tremendous pressure on the country's \nwater resources. For example, in 2000, 79 % of the \ntotal water supplied by the water-supply industry was \nlost through leakages. In recent years, Armenia has \ninvested in improving the public water-supply network \nand restructuring its drinking-water-supply sector, \nparticularly to rural areas (World Bank, 2017a), and \nwater losses are slowly being reduced. \n\nArmenia\tmeets\tabout\t65\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\twater\tdemand\t\nfrom surface-water resources. In particular, Lake \nSevan plays an important role in meeting the country's \nwater demand, which creates pressures on both the \necological and hydrological conditions of the lake. In \nparallel, water abstraction from groundwater resources \nhas also more than doubled since 2000. Groundwater \nis mainly used for drinking purposes and agriculture, \nparticularly for fish farming (UNECE, 2000c). \n\nAzerbaijan is another country in the region facing \nsevere water stress conditions, and where the annual \naverage\twater\texploitation\tindex\tis\tabove\t40\u00a0%.\t\n(e.g.72.3 % in 2017) (8). As a result of climate conditions, \nonly\ta\tquarter\u00a0of\tthe\ttotal\tprecipitation\tcontributes\tto\t\ninternal flow in the country's water resources. Annual \naverage RWR are declining.

There are also international \nriver basins where EU Member States and some \nEaP countries share hydrological basins or they are \nriparian\u00a0(9). For instance, the Danube (Romania, \nHungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Ukraine), Vistula \n(Poland, Ukraine and Belarus), Neman (Lithuania and \nBelarus) and Daugava (Latvia and Belarus) are some \nof the river basins hydrologically linking the countries \n(EEA, 2012b). \n\nThe EU Water Framework Directive underlines the \nimportance of coordination with those non-member \nstates where the river basins extend beyond the \nboundaries of the EU with reference to the UN Water \nConvention (EU, 2000). \n\nWater inflow from neighbouring countries is an \nindispensable part of generating the RWR in the \ndownstream countries. Therefore, coordination and \ncooperation among the respective countries are \nvital to sustain freshwater ecosystems and meet \nsocio-economic water demand in line with international \nnorms, such as the UNECE Water Convention, which \nis a long-term UN endeavour. In many cases, a large \nproportion of RWR are generated in the upstream \nor riparian catchments of the international basins. \nThe measure of the proportion of RWR flowing from \nupstream/neighbouring countries to downstream \ncountries is called the dependency ratio. \n\nBecause all large rivers flow through the countries, \nwater inflowing from neighbouring countries also has \npolitical impacts among the EaP countries. Aras and \nKura start from Turkey and flow through Armenia, \nIran and Azerbaijan and Georgia and Azerbaijan to \nthe Caspian Sea. Overall, Azerbaijan is most heavily \ndependent on the inflow of surface water and \ngroundwater from neighbouring countries, followed \nby Belarus (Figure 3.2).

The target \nfor transboundary cooperation is measured by \nindicator 6.5.2: the proportion of transboundary \nbasin area with an operational arrangement for \nwater\u00a0cooperation.\tAccording\tto\tthe\tUN\tindicator\t\ndatabase, Moldova performs the best, followed by \nUkraine, while other countries in the region vary \ngreatly (UN, 2018). \n\nOverall, the EU Water Initiative and the EU Water \nDiplomacy initiative promote accession to international \n\nagreements, such as UNECE Convention on the \nProtection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses \nand International Lakes and policy dialogue at the \nnational and regional level (EC, 2018). \n\nEventually, changing natural hydrological conditions \nassociated with increasing socio-economic demand \nfor water may exacerbate competition and tensions \nbetween upstream and downstream water users in \nthe region. This may be overcome by implementing \nthe principles of IWRM based on improved monitoring \nprogrammes, harmonised regional data, and the free \nexchange of data and information at the regional \nlevel. Further measures for increasing efficiency in \nwater use, and coherent development pathways in \nall economic sectors, which respect the limitations of \nthe hydrological conditions, need to be implemented \n(see\u00a0also\t(Strosser\tet\tal.,\t2017)).\t\n\nBox\t3.1\t\t Azerbaijan-Georgia\tbilateral\tcooperation\tfor\tthe\tKura\tRiver\tBasin\t\n\nAzerbaijan Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and Georgia's \nMinistry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection are \ncooperating in the sustainable management of water resources in the \nKura river.

Agriculture, public \nwater supply and industry are the major sectors \nrequiring water in the EaP countries. Low efficiency \nof water use, particularly in agriculture and public \nwater supply, is exposing high water-abstraction \ndemands and increasing pressures on water resources \nin Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova. This \nchapter deals with the pressures currently exerted \nby the economic sectors on water resources, and \ntrends in water abstraction and water use across \nthe\tcountries\u00a0(see\u00a0Box\u00a04.1\tfor\tclarification\tof\twater\t\nabstraction and use). \n\n4.1 Water abstraction by source\n\nOverall, water abstraction in Belarus, Moldova and \nUkraine has substantially decreased for various \nsector-based drivers. Despite continuous severe \nwater-scarcity conditions, water abstraction in \nArmenia\u00a0and\tAzerbaijan\thave\tshown\ta\tsteady\tincrease,\t\nwhereas a substantial increase has been observed in \nGeorgia, since 2005 (Figure 4.1). \n\nIn general, surface waters meet the largest proportion \nof water demand in the EaP countries, while \ngroundwater resources are the main source of water \n\n4 Water abstraction and water use\n\nKey messages\n\nBetween 2000-2017, the annual total water abstraction in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine declined substantially \nbut\tincreased\u00a0in\tArmenia\t(32\u00a0%),\tGeorgia\t(22\u00a0%)\tand\tAzerbaijan\t(10\u00a0%).\t\n\nOverall, surface waters meet the largest proportion of water demand in the EaP countries, while groundwater \nresources are the main source of water in Belarus. Since 2000, water abstraction from groundwater resources \nhas increased by a quarter in Georgia, doubled in Armenia and almost quadrupled in Azerbaijan. Water \nabstraction\tfrom\tgroundwater\thas\tdecreased\tby\t25\u00a0%\tin\tBelarus\tand\tby\t24\u00a0%\tin\tMoldova.\t\n\nAgriculture and public water supply are the major water-use sectors in almost all EaP countries, placing \nsignificant\twater\tdemand\ton\trenewable\tfreshwater\tresources.\tAgriculture\taccounts\tfor\tmore\tthan\t70\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\t\nwater use at the regional level in the EaP. Irrigation and aquaculture (fish farming) are two major subsectors of \nagricultural\tactivities\tdemanding\tlarge\u00a0volumes\tof\twater\tabstraction\tand\twater\tuse.\n\nPublic water supply is the second largest water-use sector in the EaP countries. Ageing conveyance systems \nand the great distance they have to cover have caused substantial water losses in the public water supply. In \n2017,\twater\tloss\treached\t79\u00a0%\tin\tArmenia,\t63\u00a0%\tin\tGeorgia,\t49\u00a0%\tin\tMoldova\tand\t48\u00a0%\tin\tAzerbaijan.\t\n\nArmenia and Belarus have progressed significantly in connecting the population to the public water supply, \nreaching\tover\t95\u00a0%,\twhereas\taround\t66\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tGeorgian\tpopulation\twere\tconnected\tto\tthe\tpublic\twater\t\nsupply system in 2017. Almost half of the population in Azerbaijan and Moldova rely on self-supply. \n\nFurther progress is needed to ensure access for all to sanitation services and hygiene in Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia and Moldova, with a particular focus on the rural population. \n\nAlthough the EaP countries registered an increase in GDP between 2000-2017, it seems that this was at the \ncost of the overexploitation of water resources, with the exception of Belarus. \n\f\nWater abstraction and water use\n\n33Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nBox 4.1 Terms for water abstraction and water use\n\nIn many cases, the terms water abstraction and water use are used interchangeably. However, using both these terms \nin the same context is often confusing for local lay readers. As the EaP countries provided data on both these variables \nin accordance with the description in the UNECE environmental indicators (UNECE, 2020a), both variables are defined as \nfollows: water abstraction is the total freshwater abstracted annually from surface and groundwater, whereas water use \nis the net freshwater supply after subtraction of water losses in transport. In this context, the difference between water \nabstraction and water use is also an indication on the conveyance efficiency. \n\nThe EEA uses water abstraction as an indication of economic pressures on water resources, for example, surface and \ngroundwater. Therefore, water abstraction is mainly assessed in the water resources context, while water use is mainly \ntaken into account as sectoral efficiency in water use (EEA, 2019d). \n\nSimilar confusion may also occur between the water-supply industry (public water supply) and water use by households. \nIn practice, water is supplied either by public water supply or self-supply. Water use by households refers to the volume of \nwater used to meet the water needs of households and the related utilities; water may be supplied either by public water \nsupply or self-supply. \n\nNote:  Data made available to the EEA under the ENI SEIS II East project.\n\nData source:  Armenia: ArmStatBank (Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia); Azerbaijan: Az STAT (State Statistical Committee \nof the Republic of Azerbaijan); Belarus: Belstat (National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus), Water Cadastre \nInformation System of the Republic of Belarus; Georgia: Water Division of the Department of Environment and Climate \nChange and the Integrated Management Division of the Department of Environmental Assessment - Ministry of Environmental \nProtection\tand\u00a0Agriculture;\tMoldova:\tStatistica\tMoldovei\t(Statistical\tDatabank\tof\tthe\tNational\tBureau\tof\tStatistics\tof\tthe\tRepublic\t\nof\tMoldova)\u00a0and\tAgency\tApele\tMoldovei;\tUkraine:\tData\thas\tbeen\tobtained\tfrom\tthe\twebsite\tof\tthe\tState\tStatistics\tService\tof\t\nUkraine:\u00a0(http://ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2006/ns_rik/ns_e/opvvr_rik_e2005.htm)\t\n\nFigure\t4.1\t\t Annual\ttotal\tfreshwater\tabstraction\t(2000-2017)\t\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1 000\n\n1 500\n\n2 000\n\n2 500\n\n3 000\n\n3 500\n\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2017\n\nMillion m3\n\nArmenia\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1 200\n\n1 600\n\nMillion m3\n\n0\n\n2 000\n\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2017\n\nBelarus\n\n10 500\n\n11 000\n\n11 500\n\n12 000\n\nMillion m3\n\n0\n\n10 000\n\n12 500\n\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2017\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nGeorgia\n\nMillion m3\n\n0\n\n2 500\n\n2000 2005 2010 2015\n\n500\n\n1 000\n\n1 500\n\n2 000\n\nUkranie\n\nMillion m3\n\n0\n\n2 000\n\n2000 2005 2010 2015\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1 200\n\n1 600\n\nMoldova\n\nMillion m3\n\n0\n\n800\n\n940\n\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2017\n\n820\n\n840\n\n860\n\n880\n\n900\n\n920\n\nhttp://ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2006/ns_rik/ns_e/opvvr_rik_e2005.htm\f\nWater abstraction and water use\n\n34 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nNote:  Data made available to the EEA under the ENI SEIS II East project.

Due to its rich groundwater \nresources, the valley is the largest agriculture zone in Armenia and is of \nstrategic importance to the country's economy. Since 2000, a large number of \nfish farms have been established here. In 2013, groundwater use by fish farms \nalone exceeded the sustainable level (World Bank, 2017a). As a result, artesian \ngroundwater resources have sharply declined. Increased groundwater \nwithdrawals adversely affected spring flow, reduced well discharges, resulted \nin falling water levels, and reduced the number of artesian wells flowing in \nthe southern part of Armenia's Ararat Basin (Valder et al., 2018). This has \ncaused conflicts with other artesian groundwater users, irrigation, domestic, \nindustrial, and cooling waters. For example, due to reduced discharge from \nthe Aknalich springs (located upstream on the left bank of the River Sevjur), \nArmenia's nuclear power plant, Metsamor, can take only half of its water \nrequirements (Mendez England and Associates, 2016). \n\nSevan Lake, Armenia \u00a9 Ani Hambardzumyan\n\n2000 2017\n\nWater \nabstraction \nfrom \ngroundwater\n(million m3)\n\nMoldova\n168\n\nArmenia\n533\n\nAzerbaijan\n547\n\nGeorgia\n399\n\nBelarus\n1 082\n\nArmenia\n1 155\n\nAzerbaijan\n2 066\n\nMoldova\n127\n\nGeorgia\n480\n\nBelarus\n812\n\nabstraction in Belarus.

High water \n\ndemand on Lake Sevan continues to put pressure on \nits hydrological and ecological condition. Meanwhile, \nArmenia noted a remarkable rise in gross agricultural \nproductivity (61 % increase between 2008-2018), at the \ncost of using a huge amount of phosphate fertilisers \n(almost 75 times more in 2015 compared to 2008) \nwhich caused increasing phosphate concentrations \n\f\nWater abstraction and water use\n\n35Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nin rivers (see Chapter 5). Since then, pumping water \nfrom groundwater resources has been seen as a viable \noption,\twith\ta\t41\u00a0%\tincrease\tin\twater\tabstraction\t\nfor agriculture and drinking purposes. Similarly, \npoor treatment of urban discharge exacerbates the \ndeterioration of surface water quality and intensifies \nthe pressure on groundwater resources, particularly \nin downstream areas of urban settlements. In parallel \nwith increasing trends in water abstraction from \ngroundwater, water irrigation in Armenia also increased \nby\t21\u00a0%\tbetween\t2011-2018\t(Statistical\tCommittee\tof\t\nthe Republic of Armenia, 2020a). \n\nOn\taverage,\tAzerbaijan\tabstracts\t11\u00a0000\u00a0million\u00a0m3 \nof water annually to meet the demands of various \neconomic\tactivities,\t89\u00a0%\tof\twhich\tis\tmet\tby\tsurface\t\nwaters. The Kura and Aras, the largest rivers flowing \ninto Azerbaijan, play a significant role in the country's \noverall water balance. In addition, Azerbaijan has \n140\u00a0reservoirs,\tonly\tthree\tof\twhich\thave\ta\tvolume\t\nlarger\tthan\t1\u00a0000\tmillion\u00a0m3. The Mingechevir reservoir \non the River Kura is the largest, with a capacity of \n15\u00a0700\u00a0million\u00a0m3, from which water is used for power \ngeneration and irrigation. The River Samur plays an \nimportant role in providing drinking water supplies and \nirrigation in north-eastern Azerbaijan and the Absheron \nPeninsula, via the Samur-Absheron channel. \n\nAzerbaijan faces water scarcity throughout the year, not \nonly in quantitative terms, but also in terms of water \nquality. To meet the growing water demands from \nagriculture and for drinking, it began to abstract more \ngroundwater. It abstracted around four times more \nwater from groundwater resources in 2017, compared \nto 2000, which created environmental problems, \nincluding aquifer depletion and contamination and \ntriggering landslides (Israfilov et al., 2014). Pressures \non groundwater will increase if current trends in water \nabstraction continue in Azerbaijan.\n\nDue to an economic recession and the introduction \nof water metering in the second half of the 2000s, \ntotal water abstraction in Belarus has decreased \nsignificantly in recent years (UNECE, 2016c). The \nannual average total freshwater abstraction is around \n1\u00a0650\u00a0million\u00a0m3, of which more than half is taken \nfrom groundwater resources and used mainly for \ndrinking purposes. Long-term intensive groundwater \nabstraction has already caused large-scale water-level \nreductions and reduced the flows of small rivers \naround the city of Minsk. As a policy response to the \n\nenvironmental consequences of intensive groundwater \nabstraction, the Government of Belarus developed \na strategy for environmental protection. It plans to \nreduce\tgroundwater\tabstraction\tto\t700-750\u00a0hm3 per \nyear by 2025. The country's current level of annual \ngroundwater\tabstraction\tis\taround\t800\u00a0million\u00a0m3. \n\nOn\taverage,\tGeorgia\tmeets\t(2000-2015)\tabout\t74\u00a0%\t\nof its annual water demand from surface waters, \nparticularly from rivers.

The current state of water supply and \ndemand in Georgia is unknown because of the lack \nof adequate data. As Georgia is a water-abundant \ncountry, withdrawing surface-water resources \nseems more economically viable than pumping \ngroundwater (10). However, high rates of water loss \nin the conveyance system (see Chapter 4.2.2) is \nexacerbating the environmental impacts of inefficient \nwater use. Abstraction from surface water for \nagriculture has more than doubled in Georgia since \n2003 (UNECE, 2016d). The leaching of nutrients from \nagricultural areas causes higher concentrations of \nnitrates, phosphates and ammonia in the waters \n(see\u00a0Chapter\u00a05).\t\n\nMoldova\tmeets\t85\u00a0%\tof\tits\tannual\twater\tdemand\tfrom\t\nsurface waters, especially from the River Dniester and \nPrut. The Dniester Basin is also a very important source \nof\tgroundwater\tabstraction,\tproviding\taround\t84\u00a0%\tof\t\ntotal water abstraction from groundwater. However, \nas abstraction by individuals is not monitored in the \ncountry, this is unlikely to be the actual level overall.\n\n4.2 Sectoral water use and resource \nefficiency\n\nAll economic sectors need water for their activities; \nagriculture, industry and most forms of energy \nproduction are not viable if water is not available \n(EEA, 2012c). Overall, agriculture and the water-supply \nindustry are the major sectors in EaP countries putting \n\n(10)  However, unregulated groundwater abstraction \u2014 for example, in eastern Georgia \u2014 is an issue, especially because aquifers are artesian which \nmeans the water does not need to be pumped (personal remark from Christoph Leitner, EUWI+).\n\f\nWater abstraction and water use\n\n36 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nsignificant water demand on RWR (Figure 4.3). Agriculture \naccounts\tfor\tmore\tthan\t70\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\twater\tuse\tat\tthe\t\nregional level in the EaP. Irrigation and aquaculture \n(fish farming) are two major sub-sectors of agricultural \nactivities demanding large volumes of water abstraction \nand water use. This is particularly true in Armenia and \nBelarus which are land-locked countries where fish \nfarming is very important in the food supply chain. Thus, \nwater use for aquaculture accounts for a substantial \nshare\twithin\tthe\tagriculture\tsector.\tFor\u00a0instance,\tin\t\nBelarus,\tirrigation\tonly\trepresents\t2\u00a0%\u00a0of\u00a0total\twater\tuse\t\nfor agriculture, whereas the remaining volume is mainly \nused for fish farming. Similarly, in Armenia, on average, \n25\u00a0%\tof\twater\tused\tfor\tagriculture\tis\tallocated\tfor\t\naquaculture every year. Economic transition and market \nconditions at the regional level also shift water demand \npressures among different sectors. For instance, due to \nMoldova's agricultural reforming process, water use for \nagriculture has declined substantially. Electricity is also a \nvery important water user, particularly in Azerbaijan and \nGeorgia. \n\nAs in the other EaP countries, agriculture is dominant in \nArmenia. Gross agricultural productivity has increased \nsignificantly\tover\tthe\tlast\tdecade\t(61\u00a0%),\temploying\t\n\naround\u00a08\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\tpopulation.\tIn\t2017,\tagriculture\t\nwas\tthe\tlargest\tsector\twith\tthe\thighest\twater\tuse\t(86\u00a0%),\t\nfollowed\tby\thouseholds\t(6\u00a0%)\t(Statistical\tCommittee\tof\t\nthe Republic of Armenia, 2020b).\n\nAround\t70\u00a0%\tof\tArmenia\tcomprises\tagricultural\tland,\tof\t\nwhich\t22\u00a0%\tis\tallocated\tfor\tcrop\tproduction\tand\talmost\t\n50\u00a0%\tof\tthis\tis\tirrigated.\tThere\twas\tno\tsignificant\tchange\t\nin the total irrigated area between 2006-2018 (Statistical \nCommittee of the Republic of Armenia, 2018). However, \nwater\tuse\tfor\tirrigation\tincreased\tby\t52\u00a0%\tbetween\t\n2000-2017, which might be associated with increasing \nwater loss in conveyance. About half of the water used \nfor agriculture comes from the water-supply industry. \n\nIn addition, Armenia uses a large volume of water for \naquaculture\t(fish\tfarms)\twhich\taccounts\tfor\t25\u00a0%\tof\t\ntotal water use by agriculture. Fish farms are mainly \nlocated in the Ararat Valley, which is under high \nwater-stress conditions.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union \nin 1991, the abandonment of many agricultural and \nindustrial areas resulted in a substantial decrease \nin water abstraction between 1990-1995 (UNECE, \n2016e). In particular, the collapse of industry after the \nSoviet era, as well as the transition from state-owned \nto privately owned farms, resulted in a substantial \nreduction in water abstraction in manufacturing \nindustries and agriculture. Since 2000, total water use \nin\tGeorgia\thas\tmore\tthan\tdoubled\t(1\u00a0834\u00a0million\u00a0m3 in \n2016) largely due to agriculture. Water abstraction and \nthe demand for water use are projected to increase \nin Georgia in the years to come, while agriculture is \nexpected to remain as the main sectoral pressure on \nrenewable water resources (UNECE, 2016e). \n\nIn Belarus, the sectors using significant amounts of the \ncountry's water resources are agriculture, particularly \nfish farming, and the public water supply. Together, \nthe annual average water abstraction for these sectors \naccounts\tfor\t60\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tcountry's\ttotal\twater\tuse.\t\nAquaculture\t(fish\tfarming)\taccounts\tfor\talmost\t98\u00a0%\tof\t\n\ntotal agricultural water use. The water-supply industry \nis the main provider of water for the population, \nwith coverage of households served by a centralised \nwater-supply\tsystem\treaching\t94.7\u00a0%.\n\nIn Moldova, available data are insufficient to assess \nthe actual level of pressure from individual economic \nsectors. In 2017, the heating and cooling water was the \nmain\twater\tuser\t(66\u00a0%),\tfollowed\tby\tthe\twater-supply\t\nindustry\t(20\u00a0%)\tand\tagriculture\t(11\u00a0%).\tThese\tshares\t\nhave stayed mainly steady since 2000. It should be \nnoted that water abstraction for cooling is returned \nenvironment with slight loss due to evaporation during \nthe cooling process. In the coming years, it is expected \nthat water abstraction for agriculture will increase \nbecause of policy reforms in the sector, which is the \nmain income generator in the country's economy \n(UNECE, 2014a).\n\n4.2.1 Water-use efficiency in the economy \n\nWater is not only a vital resource for the environment \nand freshwater ecosystems, but it also plays a \nsignificant role in national economies. For instance, \nwithout water input, it would not be possible to \nsustain agricultural activities in parts of countries \nwhere irrigation is inevitable for tackling water deficits. \nSimilarly, water is also used for electricity generation \n(both in hydropower and cooling). In addition, water \nsupply is crucial to aquaculture, which is one of the \neconomic sectors using large quantities in Belarus \nand\u00a0Armenia.\t\n\nThe efficiency of water use in an economy is measured \nby comparing water input (m3\tor\tmillion\u00a0m3) with per \nunit of GDP. \n\nA country comparison of economic water-use efficiency \n(Figure 4.4) shows that the best-performing country \nin using less water per unit GDP is Belarus. Among \nthe EaP countries, in 2017, water-use efficiency was \nthe lowest in Armenia. However, between 2000-2017, \nGDP\u00a0in\tArmenia\talmost\ttripled\t(USD\u00a08.97\u00a0billion\tin\t2000\t\ncompared\tto\tUSD\u00a025.75\u00a0billion\tin\t2017).\tIn\tparallel,\t\nthe total water use by economic sectors in Armenia \nincreased\tby\t44.5\u00a0%\tover\tthe\tsame\tperiod\t(Figure\t4.7).\n\nAll EaP countries registered a GDP at PPP at constant \nprice increase between 2000-2017, but it seems that it \nhas been at the cost of the overexploitation of water \nresources (Figure 4.5). \n\n(11)  A metric that compares different countries' currencies through a 'basket of goods' approach and thus compares economic productivity and \nstandards of living among countries.\n\f\nWater abstraction and water use\n\n38 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nAs a result of rapid economic improvements in \nAzerbaijan, GDP increased by more than a factor of \nfour (4.4) between 2000-2017. GDP at purchasing \npower parity (PPP) (11)\tincreased\tfrom\tUSD\u00a032.7\tto\t\nUSD\u00a0139.2\tbillion.\tOver\tthe\tsame\tperiod,\twater\tuse\tin\t\nAzerbaijan\tdecreased\tfrom\t243\u00a0m3/USD\u00a01,000\tGDP\tto\t\n58\u00a0m3/USD\u00a01,000\tGDP,\tindicating\ta\trelative\tdecoupling\t\nof income generation and water use. It should be noted \nthat\tthe\ttotal\tannual\tfreshwater\tuse\tincreased\tby\t1.5\u00a0%\t\nover the same period. Despite the relative efficiency \ngained, water losses in transport and an increasing \ndemand for water in agriculture remain major ongoing \nchallenges for water resources management.\n\nIn\tGeorgia,\tthe\tGDP\tbeen\tincreased\tby\t44\u00a0%\tbetween\t\n1990-2016, but at the cost of increasing water use \nover the same period. A relative decoupling achieved \nby reducing water use from 145 m3/1000 I$ in 1990 to \n38\u00a0m3/1000 I$ in 2015 whereas total water abstraction \nhas\tincreased\tby\t22\u00a0%.\t\n\nBelarus significantly improved its water-use efficiency in \nthe 2000s. As a result, water use per unit of GDP at PPP \n\nfell\tfrom\t33\u00a0m3/1\u00a0000\tUSD\tin\t1990\tto\t8\u00a0m3/1\u00a0000\u00a0USD\t\nin 2017. Over the same period, GDP at PPP roughly \ndoubled, from USD 85 billion in 1990 to USD 163 billion \nin 2017.\n\nSimilarly, in Moldova, the country's GDP more than \ndoubled\tbetween\t2000-2017,\tfrom\tUSD\u00a08.4\u00a0billion\tin\t\n2000 to USD 18.4 billion in 2017 (World Bank, 2020), \nwhile total freshwater use per unit of GDP decreased by \nabout\t60\u00a0%\t(not\tincluding\tinformation\ton\tthe\tleft\tbank\t\nof the River Nistru/Dniester). The efficiency of total water \nuse per unit of GDP was achieved by decreasing water \nuse\twhile\tmaintaining\tthe\tupward\ttrend\tin\tGDP.\tIn\u00a02000,\t\naround\t104\u00a0m3 of water was used in the country's \neconomy\tto\tproduce\tUSD\t1\u00a0000\tby\tthe\teconomy,\twhich\t\nfell\tto\t43\u00a0m3 of water used in 2017 to produce the \nsame unit of GDP. However, it should be noted that \n43\u00a0m3 of water per GDP unit is still very high compared \nto other countries, and further water-use-efficiency \nimprovements are needed in future.\n\nRecently, the EU has endorsed a new policy initiative \u2014 \nthe European Green Deal \u2014 in response to climate and \n\nNote:  Georgia 2015; Moldova 2016.

The purpose of sanitation \n\u2014 a term covering collection, transport, treatment, \ndisposal and reuse of wastewater \u2014 is to provide \n\nsafe and clean water for citizens and to protect public \nhealth. In urban and many rural areas, the public water \nsupply is one of the most effective ways to ensure the \nprovision of safe drinking water.\n\nUN SDG 6 sets targets to ensure equitable access to \ndrinking water and sanitation for all. The EU reaffirms \nits strong commitment to the implementation of \nthe UN 2030 Agenda and highlights progress in Goal \n6\t(EC,\u00a02018).\tUN\tSDG\t6\tadvocates\tthat\tw\u00e1ter-use\t\nefficiency is increased across all sectors and that \nthe number of people suffering from water scarcity \nis reduced. Similarly, countries set national targets \nin line with the Protocol on Water and Health to the \nWater Convention (UNECE, 2020b). Azerbaijan, Belarus, \nMoldova and Ukraine are Parties to the Protocol, \nwhile Armenia and Georgia have signed but not \nratified it yet (United Nations, 2020). The EU supports \nthe implementation of the Protocol by EaP countries \nthrough the EUWI+ programme. \n\nUN SDG indicators 6.1.1 (Proportion of population \nusing safely managed drinking water services) and \n6.2.1 (Proportion of population using safely managed \nsanitation services, including a hand-washing facility \nwith soap and water) measure access to safe and \naffordable drinking water, and adequate and equitable \nsanitation and hygiene for all. Within the scope of \nthis report, two different indicators \u2014 proportion of \npopulation connected to water supply, and household \nwater use per capita \u2014 have been used as indirectly \nrelevant indicators in response to the respective \nUN SDG indicators, and supplemented by a brief \nassessment based on the available WASH database \n(WHO/UNICEF, 2019). \n\n4.3.1 Population connected to a water supply\n\nThe water-supply industry provides the public with \nwater primarily for drinking and domestic use, but \nalso for various purposes including agriculture and \nindustry. The percentage of a national population \nconnected to water-supply services is a measure for \nquantifying access to improved water-supply services. \nThis indicator is important for defining the level of \ndevelopment of water economy services and the \ndegree of water accessibility to cover all household \nneeds within the population. In this context, countries \npresent highly variable levels of progress over time \n(Figure 4.6). \n\nIn\t2018,\taround\t64\u00a0%\tof\tArmenia's\tpopulation\tlived\t\nin urban areas (Statistical Committee of the Republic \nof Armenia, 2020a).

Water use per capita is an \nindication of the performance of the water-utility \nsystems, as well as the cultural behaviour linked to \nindividuals' water consumption. However, measuring \nthe impact of cultural behaviour on water consumption \nis challenging and requires a peer-to-peer comparison \nwithin the same layer of sociological groups. \n\nEaP countries present considerably different progress. \nOverall, there is a decreasing trend in population in \nall countries except Azerbaijan. The percentage of \npopulation connected to the water-supply system and \ntotal water use by households has been increasing \nin all countries since 2010. Nevertheless, each \ncountry presents different trends in total water use \nfor households, either due to improvements in the \nconveyance systems or continuing growth in the total \npopulation (Figures 4.7 and 4.8). \n\f\nWater abstraction and water use\n\n43Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nFigure\t4.7\t\t Water\tuse\tper\tcapita\tby\thouseholds\tsupplied\tby\ta\tpublic\twater\tsupply\t(m3/capita/year\tin\t2017)\n\nNote:  Data for Georgia: 2018.

As a result of this expansion, the total water \nvolume supplied to households by the water-supply \nindustry increased from 61.4 million m3 in 2009 to \n107.6 million m3 in 2017.

Despite \nthere being no significant change in the population \nduring this period, the substantial fall in demand for \nhousehold water use can only be due to better water \nefficiency.

There are many threats to \nsurface waters, including emissions of environmental \npollutants from, for example, industry or agriculture, \nor\u00a0hydromorphological\talterations.\tWhile\tenvironmental\t\npollutants can directly affect the toxicity of organisms, \nhydromorphological changes can affect habitats and \nmigration, for instance, and also have consequences for \necosystem functions, such as self-purification. In this \nreport, the focus is on the pollutants covered by UNECE \nC10\tand\tC11\tindicators\t(UNECE,\u00a02020a)\ti.e.\torganic\t\nwaste and nutrients, by replicating the similar approach \nof\tthe\tEEA's\tcore\tset\tof\u00a0indicators\tCSI\t019\tand\tCSI\t020\t\n(EEA,\t2019b,\t2019a).\u00a0This\tchapter\tgives\tan\toverview\t\nof the findings for the indicators which have been \ndeveloped\tfor\teach\u00a0EaP\tcountry.\n\nOrganic and nutrient pollution constitute serious \nthreats to water quality, both from an ecological \nperspective and as regards human uses such as \ndrinking water, bathing water and recreation. \n\nWastewater \u2014 both municipal and industrial \u2014 as \nwell as diffuse run-off from agriculture, are the main \nsources of organic waste and nutrient pollution. All of \nthese pressures affect water quality across the region.\n\nDespite some remarkable progress made in connecting \nthe population to public water supply systems in all \nsix countries, the treatment of wastewater remains \ninsufficient. For instance, in Armenia, there is hardly \nany biological treatment of wastewater to break down \norganic waste. In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, only \nhalf of the collected water is treated. In Georgia, only \na few of the municipal wastewater-treatment plants \nbuilt in the 1980s are in operation. Organic pollution \ngenerated in cities is transmitted directly to the rivers. \nIn Moldova, most treatment plants operate with \nprimary treatment only, which means that organic \nwaste is not processed. In addition, poorly treated \nindustrial wastewater affects the performance of \nmunicipal treatment plants, and much untreated \nindustrial wastewater is discharged directly into rivers. \nIn Ukraine, the urban treatment plants have insufficient \n\n5 Water quality\n\nKey messages\n\nThe main source of organic pollution in EaP countries is the direct discharge of untreated or insufficiently \ntreated wastewater into the rivers. The average BOD5 in the region has only declined slightly since 2000, \nremaining\tat\t2.7\u00a0mg\tO2/l. The average concentration of ammonium for EaP countries fluctuates between \n0.6-0.8 mg NH4-N/l.  \n\nIn the region, one quarter of the river sites are found in the two highest classes for BOD5 and three quarters \nfor ammonium concentration. The highest average levels are found on sites in the Southern Bug catchment \nin Ukraine, the Dniester catchment in Moldova, the Black Sea basin in Ukraine and upstream in the River Aras \ncatchment in Armenia. \n\nThe main sources of nutrients are agriculture, wastewater and storm water. In general, the nitrate \nconcentration in rivers does not present a high risk of eutrophication in rivers in EaP countries. The average \nnitrate\tconcentration\tin\tthese\tcountries\tfell\tby\t10\u00a0%\tbetween\t2008-2017.\tCurrently,\tthe\taverage\tconcentration\t\nis\t0.9\u00a0mg\tNO3-N/l.\tMore\tthan\t60\u00a0%\tof\tall\triver\tsites\tfall\tinto\tthe\tlowest\tclasses\tfor\tnitrate.\tIn\t2017,\tthe\t\nphosphate\tconcentration\t(0.1-8\u00a0mg\tP/l)\twas\t50\t%\thigher\tthan\tin\t2008.\tMore\tthan\t40\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tsites\thave\ta\t\nphosphate\tconcentration\thigher\tthan\t0.1\u00a0mgP/l,\twhich\tis\tconsidered\thigh\tenough\tto\tcause\teutrophication.\t\t\n\nRiver water downstream of cities and towns is significantly more polluted than it is upstream. Overall, while \nupstream of cities, organic pollution and pollution from nutrients has declined since 2000, concentrations of \nammonium and phosphate downstream have increased in many rivers.\n\f\nWater quality\n\n49Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\ncapacity, lack any tertiary treatment and technically \nare in poor condition, while there is a general lack \nof sewage networks in rural areas. However, new \ninvestments are ongoing to improve wastewater \ntreatment in the region.\n\nDue to suitable topographic and soil conditions, large \nareas of the region are used for agriculture and this \nsector employs millions of rural inhabitants. However, \nhigh \u2014 and increasing \u2014 applications of manure and \ninorganic fertiliser, as well as inadequate agronomic \npractices, make agriculture a major driver of the \nreleases of nutrients, ammonium and organic matter \ninto the water system. \n\nThus, deteriorating water quality is not a new problem \nin the region. It will be exacerbated in the future \nwith the intensification of agriculture and greater \nindustrialisation and urbanisation, particularly if \nthese developments are not supported by improved \nwastewater treatment. A lack of financial resources \nor the insufficient management of water resources, \ninstitutionally or technically, will add to the problem. \n\nUnder the EU Water Framework Directive, the ecological \nand chemical status of water bodies is assessed \naccording to a range of components. This status is \nused as the basis for implementing measures targeted \nat individual water bodies, with an overall objective of \nachieving good ecological and chemical (environmental \npollutant) status. For the classification of ecological \nstatus, the main focus is on the biological components \nand how the biological conditions deviate from \nreference conditions. Chemical parameters, such as \nnutrient concentrations, are used only as supporting \nquality elements. As such, the indicator approach is \nsimpler. However, the purpose is also different: rather \nthan giving a full basis for implementing measures for \nindividual water bodies, they provide a general overview \nof regional patterns and development over time for \ncertain aspects of water quality. This gives policymakers \nand environmental managers an indication of the \nsituation and whether it is improving or deteriorating. \nWithout specific data on emissions coupled to the \nwater-quality data, it is difficult to state the exact causes \nof the observed changes or differences. However, the \ngeneral patterns indicate the adequacy of national or \nregional legislation and regulations and the need for \nfurther measures to be taken. \n\nHere, organic matter and ammonium in rivers and \nnutrients in freshwater are used to evaluate some \naspects of the water-quality situation in the region. \nFor the components in question, there are no \n\ngeneral thresholds for assessing whether or not the \nconcentrations are acceptable from an ecological \nperspective. Under the EU WFD, the classification \nof supporting quality elements is based on national \nsystems with specific class boundaries set for different \nwater-body types, characterised by factors such as \ngeology, climate or altitude. Such classification systems \nare not available for the EaP countries. Although they \noften have national targets or maximum permissible \nconcentrations for pollutants, these are frequently \nquite high and may be targeted at purposes other than \nprotecting the ecosystem, such as the use of water for \ndrinking. These are referred to in the next section. \n\nAs a general reference, the targets for ammonium \nconcentration and biochemical oxygen (O2) demand \n(BOD) in the EU Fish Directive (2006) are also used (12). \nHowever, the main approach is to evaluate relative \nchanges over time and regional differences. The \ncommon time period studied is 2008-2017, but the text \nalso refers to developments up to 2008, where data \nwere available. The current state of water in rivers is \ndefined as the average for the last three years with \navailable data, i.e. 2015-2017.\n\n5.1 Organic matter and ammonium \nin\u00a0rivers\n\nThe discharge of large quantities of organic matter \ncontaining microbes and decaying organic waste, either \nfrom agriculture or as wastewater from households or \nindustrial effluents, may result in poorer chemical and \nbiological quality in river water, reduced biodiversity in \naquatic communities, and microbiological contamination \nthat can affect the quality of drinking and bathing water. \nOrganic pollution leads to higher rates of metabolic \nprocesses that demand oxygen. This can result in the \ndevelopment of water zones without oxygen (anaerobic \nconditions) which has profound direct impacts on \nthe ecosystem. The transformation of nitrogen (N) \nto reduce forms under anaerobic conditions, in turn, \nleads to greater concentrations of ammonium, which \nis toxic to aquatic life above certain concentrations, \ndepending on water temperature, salinity and acidity. \nThe organic matter level in water is expressed  as the \nbiological oxygen demand (BOD), which is defined \nas the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the \naerobic decomposition of the organic matter present \nin water. It is measured as the amount of oxygen \nconsumed during five days of incubation at 20 degrees \nCelsius\t(BOD5,\u00a0hereafter\tnamed\tBOD\tfor\tshort).\t\nBOD\tis\texpressed\tin\u00a0mg\tof\tO2/litre, while ammonium \nconcentration is expressed in mg of NH4-N/litre. \n\n(12)  Water for cyprinid fish targets: 0.16 mg NH4-N/l and 6 mg O2/l;\twater\tfor\tsalmonid\tfish:\t0.03\u00a0mg\tNH4-N/l,\t3\u00a0mg\tO2/l.\n\f\nWater quality\n\n50 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\n5.1.1 Changes over time \n\nThe main source of organic pollution in Armenia is \nuntreated or insufficiently treated wastewater which, \ndue to the lack of treatment plants, is emitted into the \nrivers. There are only six water-treatment plants in \nArmenia, using only mechanical treatment whereby \norganic waste is not processed. From 2008-2017, the \nammonium concentrations and BOD in rivers increased \nby\t72\u00a0%\tand\t18\u00a0%,\trespectively\t(Figure\t5.1).\tAn\tincrease\t\nwas mainly observed at sites below settlements. \nEmissions in the less-populated areas have not \nchanged a lot in this period. The River Hrazdan is one \nof the longest and most-polluted rivers in Armenia. \nThe effect of the influences of untreated wastewater is \nsignificant, especially at one highly polluted monitoring \nsite located downstream, which is the nearest and \nmost-impacted site after Yerevan City, the capital of \nArmenia and home to around 1 million inhabitants. \nThe pollution level at this site has a major impact on \nthe country average, resulting in both higher absolute \n\nlevels of pollution and a larger increase over time. This \nis particularly evident for ammonium. \n\nIn Azerbaijan, between 2001-2017, there was a slight \nincrease in ammonium concentration and a slight \ndecrease\tin\tBOD\t(by\t32\u00a0%\tand\t25\u00a0%,\trespectively,\twhen\t\ncomparing the average of the last three years to that \nof the first three years). However, BOD has increased \nfrom its minimum level in 2012, while ammonium \nhas decreased in recent years. For both pollutants, \nthere was a period when levels were higher than they \nare currently. For BOD, this occurred mainly before \n2008, although mainly after 2008 for ammonium. The \ntime-series patterns seen at the national level are \nbroadly similar at the regional level. \n\nTransboundary transport, industrial and agricultural \nproduction, old sewer systems, and a lack of \nsolid-waste management in some rural areas led to \nan increase in organic pollution in Azerbaijan up to \n2010. The Shamkir and Mingachevir reservoirs along \nthe River Kura were affected by the discharge of \n\nFigure 5.1  Average annual ammonium concentration and BOD for river sites in the EaP countries over \nthe\tperiod\t2008-2017\n\nNote:  Only complete time series after inter/extrapolation are included. \n\nData source:  Armenia: Environmental Monitoring and Information Center SNCO, Ministry of Nature Protection; Azerbaijan: National \nEnvironmental Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources; Belarus: National Environmental \nMonitoring System by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection; Georgia: National Environmental \nAgency of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture; Environment Quality Monitoring Division of the State \nHydrometeorological\tService\tof\tthe\u00a0Ministry\tof\tAgriculture,\tRegional\tDevelopment\tand\tEnvironment;\tMoldova:\tMinistry\tof\t\nAgriculture, Regional Development and Environment; Ukraine: Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2008\n2009\n\n2010\n2011\n\n2012\n2013\n\n2014\n2015\n\n2016\n2017\n\nBOD5 in rivers\n\nMg O2/l\n\nArmenia (45 sites) Azerbaijan (43 sites)\n\nBelarus (176 sites) Georgia (32 sites)\n\nMoldova (19 sites) Ukraine (89 sites)\n\nAverage of EaP countries\n\n0\n\n1.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nMg NH4-N/l\n\nAmmonium in rivers\n\n2008\n2009\n\n2010\n2011\n\n2012\n2013\n\n2014\n2015\n\n2016\n2017\n\nArmenia (45 sites) Azerbaijan (42 sites)\n\nBelarus (176 sites) Georgia (32 sites)\n\nMoldova (19 sites) Ukraine (92 sites)\n\nAverage of EaP countries\n\f\nWater quality\n\n51Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nwastewater from many settlements in the Kura river \nbasin. However, over the last seven to eight years, \nthe installation of new modern wastewater treatment \nplants in the country has reduced organic pollution. \n\nIn Belarus, the average BOD has declined since \n1992, particularly in the period 1997-1998. For the \nwhole period 1986-2017, the BOD decreased by \n19\u00a0%\u00a0(comparing\tthe\taverage\tof\tthe\tlast\tthree\tyears\tto\t\nthat of the first three years). The largest decrease was \nobserved in the Western Bug river basin, followed by \nthe Dniepr (main river) and Pripyat river basins, while \nthere has hardly been any change overall in Western \nDvina, the river basin with the lowest BOD levels.\n\nAlthough concentration levels of ammonium have \nbeen more variable in Belarus, there has been a steady \ndecline since 1998. This is also seen in the different \nriver basins. However, all river basins except Western \nDvina experienced a sharp increase in 1997-1998, rising \nfrom levels similar to the current level in the preceding \ndecade. This is in contrast to the marked decrease \nin BOD in the same period and may partly indicate \ndifferent sources of pollution. However, the falling levels \nin both parameters \u2014 ammonium in particular over \nthe last two decades \u2014 indicates an overall reduction in \npressure exerted by organic pollution. This is in line with \nan observed reduction in volumes of wastewater from \n2005\tto\t2014\t(UNECE,\u00a02016a).\n\nIn Georgia, BOD decreased somewhat between \n2004-2018\t(by\t11\u00a0%\twhen\tcomparing\tthe\taverage\tof\t\nthe last three years to that of the first three years). \nThe main decline was in the Black Sea river basin \n(21\u00a0%).\tThe\taverage\tfor\tthe\tKura\triver\tbasin\tincreased\t\ntowards 2006 but has fallen since then. Ammonium \nconcentration showed a more pronounced decrease \n(50\u00a0%).\tThe\tlargest\tdecrease\twas\tobserved\tfor\trivers\t\nin\tthe\tKura\triver\tbasin\t(62\u00a0%).\tThe\tresults\tfor\tthe\tyears\t\n2011-2013 should be treated with some caution, \ndue to lower numbers of samples per year, which \nmay explain some of the variability observed for \nammonium concentration during this period.\n\nThe decreases in ammonium concentrations and \nBOD in Georgia can be attributed to measures such \nas better urban and industrial wastewater treatment. \nFurther improvement is expected for the Black Sea \nriver basin where the large cities have not previously \nhad wastewater-treatment plants. Water-treatment \nplants are currently under construction in Zugdidi \nand Poti and the construction of a treatment plant in \nKutaisi is planned.\n\nIn Moldova, the average ammonium concentrations \nand BOD in rivers show similar patterns over \nthe\u00a0period\t1992-2017,\twith\tdeclining\tlevels\tuntil\t\n\n1997-1998 then fluctuating higher levels, and finally \nreturning to similar levels as at the start of the \nperiod. Ammonium concentrations were highest \nbetween 2001-2004, while BOD was highest between \n2003-2008. However, increases in pollution can be \nattributed to sites in the Dniester river basin. For sites \nin the Danube-Prut river basin and the two sites on \nthe Danube and its tributary (Cog\u00eelnic) ammonium \nconcentrations generally declined over time and BOD \nlevels were stable or fell slightly.\n\nIn Moldova, river water downstream of cities and towns \nwas significantly more polluted than that upstream. \nUpstream of cities, ammonium concentrations have \ndecreased steadily since 1992, although less so in \nrecent years, while concentrations downstream have \nincreased. This trend can be attributed to non-treated \neffluent from the cities. The up-downstream difference \nis less for BOD whereby the downstream level has \ndecreased in recent years, approaching that of the \nupstream level. Poorly treated or untreated wastewater \nis a general issue in Moldova. Most treatment plants \nhave only mechanical treatment and many do \nnot function very well. There is also an issue with \ninsufficiently pretreated industrial wastewater being \ndischarged into municipal treatment plants, thereby \nreducing their performance (UNECE, 2014a). \n\nIn Ukraine, over the period 2000-2017, the average \nBOD in rivers was lowest in 2010, after which it \nincreased. However, the current level is similar to that \nof 2003-2004. Although ammonium concentrations \nhave fluctuated significantly, overall the concentrations \nincreased between 2000-2017. Insufficient or lack of \nwastewater treatment are important causes of river \npollution in Ukraine (UNECE, 2007b).\n\n5.1.2 Current status \n\nIn\tArmenia,\t44\u00a0%\tand\t31\u00a0%\tof\tthe\triver\tsites\tfall\tinto\tthe\t\ntwo highest concentration classes for ammonium and \nBOD levels, respectively, based on data for 2015-2017 \n(Figure 5.2). The highest average BOD was found in the \nHrazdan\triver\tbasin,\tfollowed\tby\tAkhuryan\t(Map\u00a05.1).\t\nHrazdan is the most-populated river basin, while the \nsecond most-populated city (Gyumri) is located in \nthe Akhuryan river basin. The wastewaters from both \ncities discharge directly into the rivers, due to a lack of \nwastewater-treatment plants. The best water-quality \nconditions are found in the Sevan river basin, where \nthe rivers are mainly subjected to diffuse sources of \nwater pollution which do not have a significant impact. \nHowever, even here, two sites had average ammonium \nconcentrations above the recommended levels for \ncyprinid fish in the EU Fish Directive (2006/44/EC). To \nreduce the pollution of surface waters (especially in \n\f\nWater quality\n\n52 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nthe Sevan river basin) new legislation requires local \ntreatment of wastewater from recreation areas before \nit is discharged into rivers or lakes.\n\nAll but one of Armenia's river basins, the Ararat, had \nriver sites where the current ammonium concentration \nexceeded the recommended concentration for cyprinid \nfish.\tIn\ttotal,\t49\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tsites\texceeded\trecommended\t\nammonium concentrations. Although most of the \nelevated concentrations were found downstream of \nsettlements, some were located above settlements, \npossibly because the headwaters are not protected by \nthe legislation. The Armenian authorities are filling the \ngap in the legislation to protect headwater areas, starting \nwith the Akhuryan river basin. The recommended \nBOD\tlevel\tfor\tsalmonid\tfish\twas\texceeded\tat\t31\u00a0%\tof\t\nmonitoring locations. Two sites also exceeded the \nBOD threshold for cyprinid fish. The good/moderate \nthresholds in the national legislation are generally higher \nthan the recommended levels in the EU Fish Directive. \n\nIn Azerbaijan, none of the river sites were assigned \nto the three upper BOD classes. Moreover, no \n\nsites exceeded the national maximum allowable \nconcentration for ammonium concentration \n(0.4\u00a0mg\u00a0NH4-N/l), which corresponds to the highest \nammonium\tclass.\tNevertheless,\t20\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tsites\thad\t\ncurrent ammonium concentration corresponding to the \nsecond highest ammonium class. The recommended \nammonium concentration level for salmonid fish \nwas always exceeded, and the cyprinid threshold \nwas\texceeded\tat\t35\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tsites.\tRiver\tsites\tin\tthe\t\nKura river basin had somewhat higher ammonium \nconcentrations and BOD than river sites draining into \nthe Caspian Sea.\n\nIn\tBelarus,\tonly\t6\u00a0%\tof\triver\tsites\thad\tcurrent\tBOD\t\nabove the lowest national maximum permissible \nconcentration\t(3\u00a0mg\tO2/l).

Eutrophication can cause \necological impacts, such as the loss of plant and \nanimal species (reduction in ecological status) and \nhave negative impacts on the use of water for human \nconsumption and other purposes. In this next section, \nthe concentration of phosphate and total phosphorus \nis expressed in mg of P/l, while the concentration \nof nitrate in rivers is expressed in mg of NO3-N/l. \nNitrate in groundwater is also included in the UNECE \nC11 indicator and is an essential aspect of nutrients \nin freshwater, in particular in terms of the use of \ngroundwater for drinking water. However, as few \ncountries provided data on this, groundwater is only \ncovered to a limited extent. The availability of lake data \nwas also poor in many of the countries.\n\n5.2.1 Changes over time\n\nThe main sources of nutrients in Armenia are \nagriculture, wastewater and storm water. There are \nonly six water-treatment plants in Armenia, with \nmechanical and no organic matter treatment. Nitrate \npollution is mainly associated with agricultural run-off. \nFor instance, in Lake Sevan, agriculture has been shown \n\nto be a much larger contributor to nitrogen pollution \nthan households (UNECE, 2000d). \n\nIn Armenia, river nitrate concentrations increased by \nan\taverage\tof\t18\u00a0%\tbetween\t2008-2017\t(Figure\u00a05.3).\t\nHowever, the increase was associated with sites \ndownstream of settlements. Above settlements, there \nwas a slight fall in nitrate concentrations. In contrast, \nthe increase in river phosphate concentrations \nwas about the same upstream and downstream \nof settlements. Overall, phosphate concentrations \nincreased\tby\t33\u00a0%\tbetween\t2009-2017.\tThe\tincrease\t\nis much higher when comparing 2017 to 2008, but \nas concentrations were particularly low in 2008 the \ncomparison with 2009 better reflects the general \nincrease. Rising nutrient concentrations are the \nresult of increased emissions from wastewater and \nagriculture. The River Hrazdan is one of the longest \nand most-polluted rivers in Armenia and has very high \nphosphate concentrations, particularly at the nearest \nsite downstream of Yerevan City. Removing this site \nfrom the overall average significantly reduces the \nnational phosphate concentration. No such effect is \nseen for nitrate, indicating that wastewater is the major \ncontributor at this site.\n\nIn Lake Sevan, the average nitrate and phosphorus \nconcentrations increased markedly between 2008-2012. \nThis might be a consequence of a rise in the level of \nthe lake in an attempt to restore its natural state (see \nChapter 4.1) \u2014 when water covered buildings, roads \nand forests on the lake shore the nutrient pollution \nincreased. Average total phosphorus concentrations \nin the lake also rose between 2013-2017. Diffuse runoff from agricultural land and untreated domestic \nwastewater continues to provide significant sources of \nphosphorus pollution. Although these pollution sources \ndo not have a big impact on the rivers in the region they \naffect Lake Sevan due to direct discharges into the lake. \nMoreover, phosphorus stored in the sediment can keep \nlake concentrations high and prevent improvements to \nthe water quality through management measures.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, river data are available from 2001. \nA\u00a0strong\tdecline\tin\taverage\triver\tnitrate\tconcentration\t\noccurred from 2005, in particular from 2011 onwards, \nreaching very low average levels from 2014 onwards. \nThe time-series pattern was fairly similar between the \ndifferent regions. For river phosphate concentration, \nthe time series showed different patterns between \nregions. The concentrations in Ganja-Gazakh, and \nparticularly in Shirvan, increased markedly between \n2009-2011. A slower but steady increase also occurred \nin the Guba-Khachmaz region. These patterns are \nreflected in the overall time series for the whole \ncountry, where the average phosphate concentration \ndoubled between 2001-2011.\n\f\nWater quality\n\n55Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nData from eight lakes and reservoirs in Azerbaijan \nshow an abrupt increase and subsequent decrease for \nboth phosphate and nitrate concentrations, starting \nin 2009 and 2007, respectively. Despite the decrease, \ncurrent levels are far higher than at the beginning of \nthe time series in 2001. An overall decrease in nitrate \nconcentrations in rivers was not observed for lakes and \nreservoirs.\n\nThe time series data from Belarus start in 1986. Since \nthen, there has been an increase in average nitrate \nconcentrations. This has been observed both for the \ncountry as a whole and in the different regions. Over \nthe last decade, there has only been a slow increase in \nnitrate concentrations. The maximum concentrations \nfor river phosphate occurred between 1988-1990, and \nconcentrations were also high between 2003-2004. \nOver the past decade, there has been an increase in \nphosphate concentrations in the Western Dvina and \nNeman river basins, and a decrease in the Western \nBug and Dnieper (main river) river basins, although \n\nthe overall trend is for a slight decline. Agriculture is \nthe main source of diffuse pollution in Belarus, where \nthe use of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers \nhas increased. The other major nutrient source is \nwastewater emissions, which fell between 2005 and \n2014 (UNECE, ed., 2016a). The somewhat different \ntrends for nitrate and phosphate may be explained by \nthe different trends in these two sources \u2014 nitrate is \nmore strongly associated with agricultural run-off than \nwastewater, while the opposite is true for phosphate.\n\nAverage total phosphorus concentration in lakes \nin Belarus was highest between 1988-1995 and \n2003-2007. The highest concentrations were observed \nin the Pripyat river basin. Over the past decade, the \naverage total phosphorus concentration has decreased \nin all river basins.\n\nIn Georgia, there was a marked increase in both \nphosphate and nitrate concentration between 2004-2017. \nThese increases were associated with sites in the Kura \n\nFigure 5.3  Average annual nitrate and phosphate concentration for river sites in EaP countries over \nthe\u00a0period\t2008-2017\n\nNote:  Only complete time series after inter/extrapolation are included.\n\nData source:  Armenia: Environmental Monitoring and Information Center SNCO, Ministry of Nature Protection; Azerbaijan: National \nEnvironmental Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources; Belarus: National Environmental \nMonitoring System by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection; Georgia: National Environmental \nAgency of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture; Environment Quality Monitoring Division of the State \nHydrometeorological\tService\tof\tthe\u00a0Ministry\tof\tAgriculture,\tRegional\tDevelopment\tand\tEnvironment;\tMoldova:\tMinistry\tof\t\nAgriculture, Regional Development and Environment; Ukraine: Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources.\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n2008\n2009\n\n2010\n2011\n\n2012\n2013\n\n2014\n2015\n\n2016\n2017\n\nNitrate in rivers\n\nMg NO3-N/l\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nMg P/l\n\nPhosphate in rivers\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n2008\n2009\n\n2010\n2011\n\n2012\n2013\n\n2014\n2015\n\n2016\n2017\n\nArmenia (45 sites) Azerbaijan (47 sites)\n\nBelarus (176 sites) Georgia (32 sites)\n\nMoldova (19 sites) Ukraine (90 sites)\n\nAverage of EaP countries\n\nArmenia (45 sites) Azerbaijan (43 sites)\n\nBelarus (176 sites) Georgia (32 sites)\n\nUkraine (90 sites)\n\nAverage of EaP countries\n\f\nWater quality\n\n56 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nriver basin where, on average, phosphate concentrations \nwere more than three times higher at the end of the time \nseries, whilst nitrate concentrations doubled. Data from \n2011-2013 should be treated with some caution because \nof the lower numbers of samples taken each year. This \ncan explain the higher concentrations observed during \nthese years. The concentrations for sites in the Black Sea \nriver basin have been fairly stable, with a slight decrease \nobserved for nitrate. \n\nLake data were available for Lake Paliastomi, located \nclose to the coast in the west of Georgia. Here, \nphosphate concentrations decreased sharply from \n2005 and have been relatively stable since 2008. Nitrate \nconcentrations have been highly variable, with the \nlowest values observed between 2012 and 2014. \n\nIn Moldova, there has been an overall decrease in \naverage river nitrate concentrations since 1992. \nHowever, the levels have been variable, with a marked \npeak in 1998. Since 2008, nitrate levels have been \nrelatively stable, a trend which is seen across the three \nmajor river basins. River phosphate data were not \navailable for Moldova, but total phosphorus data show \nthat the average concentration fell in the 1990s, rose \ntowards 2008 and then decreased again very slowly. \nThis pattern is seen in all river basins, but most strongly \nin the Dniester basin.\n\nData were available for three lakes/reservoirs in \nMoldova. These showed a general decrease in nitrate \nconcentrations, with the exception of a peak in 1998, \nsimilar to nitrate in rivers. The general decrease can \nbe related to a decline in agricultural activities. Total \nphosphorus concentration showed a steady decrease \nin\tthe\ttwo\treservoirs\t(Dub\u0103sari\tCentrala\tHidroelectric\u0103\t\nand\tCoste\u0219ti\tCentrala\tHidroelectric\u0103)\tbetween\t\n1992-2017.\tHowever,\tLake\tGhidighici\tin\tthe\tChi\u0219in\u0103u\t\narea showed a marked increase between 2005-2012, \nwith a subsequent decrease back to its original levels. \nThe increase might be related to a larger input of \nuntreated urban wastewater and higher fertilisation \nrates from agricultural activities.\n\nIn Ukraine, the average river nitrate concentration \nin 2000 was at about the same level as it is at \npresent, although there was a marked peak in \n2009 followed by a subsequent decrease. River \nphosphate concentrations were lower around 2009 \nbut have increased since and are currently more than \n0.1\u00a0mg\tP/l\thigher\tthan\tin\t2000.\tThe\tincrease\tin\tthe\t\nconcentration of phosphate may indicate a lack of \nwastewater treatment and an increase in the use of \nphosphate-based detergents. There is some variation \nin concentration patterns between the different rivers. \nIn the Prut and Dniester river basins, both nitrate and \nphosphate concentrations have been falling.\n\n5.2.2 Current status\n\nIn Armenia, the current river nitrate concentration was \nin\tthe\trange\tbetween\t3.6-5.6\u00a0mg\tNO3/l at three sites \nand\tabove\t6\u00a0mg\tNO3/l at one site (Figure 5.4). These \nsites were found in the Hrazdan and Northern river \nbasins which, along with the Akhuryan river basin, had \nthe\thighest\taverage\tnitrate\tconcentrations\t(Map\u00a05.2).\t\nAbout\t36\u00a0%\tof\u00a0the\tsites\tbelonged\tto\tthe\tlowest\tnitrate\t\nconcentration\tclass.\tFor\triver\tphosphate,\t40\u00a0%\tof\t\nthe sites belonged to the three upper concentration \nclasses. The average concentration was far higher in \nthe Hrazdan and Akhuryan river basins. As seen for \norganic pollution, these river basins stand out with \nparticularly high nutrient concentrations. They are the \ntwo most-populated river basins with the two largest \ncities in the country, Yerevan and Gyumri. Wastewater \nfrom both cities discharge directly into the rivers \ndue to lack of wastewater treatment. Across all river \nbasins, nutrient concentrations were generally higher \ndownstream than upstream of settlements, due to \nemissions of wastewater. \n\nThe four Lake Sevan sites all had low nitrate \nconcentrations. In addition, the current total \nphosphorus concentration was relatively low (below \n0.05\u00a0mg\tP/l),\talthough\tif\tthe\tincreasing\ttrend\tcontinues\t\nit may reach levels that can cause eutrophication.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, current phosphate and nitrate \nconcentrations were generally low at river sites, \nand way below the national maximum permitted \nconcentrations\t(1.1\u00a0mg\tP/l\tand\t10\u00a0mg\tNO3-N/l, \nrespectively). The nitrate concentration was always \nbelow\t0.2\u00a0mg\tNO3-N/l.\tAt\t28\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tsites\t(all\tin\tthe\t\nKura river basin) phosphate concentrations were in the \nrange\tof\t0.02-0.05\u00a0mg\tP/l.\tThese\tsites\tshould\treceive\t\nparticular attention in terms of management measures \nto reduce nutrient pollution. \n\nLow nitrate concentrations were also found in \nlakes and reservoirs, although concentrations were \nslightly\u00a0higher\tthan\tin\tthe\trivers.\tLake\tShabran\thad\t\nnitrate\tconcentrations\tabove\t0.8\u00a0mg\tNO3-N/l, and \nonly\u00a0the\u00a0Ceyranbatan\treservoir\trecorded\tbelow\t\n0.2\u00a0mg\tNO3-N/l. For phosphate, the difference \nbetween the sites was bigger, and three sites had \ncurrent\tconcentrations\tabove\t0.1\u00a0mg\tP/l,\twhich\tcan\t\nbe\u00a0sufficient\tto\tcause\teutrophication.\t\n\nIn Belarus, all the rivers were in the three lowest \nnitrate concentration classes.

This will persist within the national territories as well as between upstream and downstream water \nusers in the transboundary river basins. \n\nThe European Green Deal will certainly change the overall approach to the challenges of climate change \nand biodiversity loss in the coming years. In the EaP context, this call for action in various areas, such as the \napproximation of water laws to the EU WFD, institutional integration and development of sufficient expertise, \nas well as implementation of integrated and sustainable management of water resources. The current national \npolicy dialogues under the EU Water Initiative are providing intersectoral and interagency platforms to discuss \nstrategic planning and reforms in water sectors in the EaP countries. \n\nWith EU support, all EaP countries have harmonised their water quality data with the EU Water Information \nSystem\t(WISE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0water\tquality)\tdata\tdictionary.\tData\tharmonisation\tshould\texpand\tover\tother\tWISE\t\ncomponents, such as water quantity, emissions and spatial data. This will enable comparable and \ninteroperable data and information to be obtained at the region level which is crucially important for \nsupporting EU water diplomacy in the region. \n\nThe EEA has provided substantial technical and expert support towards developing water information systems \nin Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. These systems will facilitate data sharing across the water agencies as well \nas integration of water data at the national and local level. However, further maintenance and sustainability of \nthe information systems must be ensured by the respective host institutions. \n\nData integration at the national and local scale present large gaps in the water area.

However, within the time frame of the ENI SEIS II East \nproject, only a few selected indicators could be developed. Thematic coverage of the indicators needs to be \nexpanded in the future to underpin knowledge-based policymaking in the area of water in the EaP countries. \n\nThere is still a need to further improve expert capacity in data processing and undertaking the relevant \nassessment. Stability within the pool of experts and ensuring the continuous development of expert capacity \nneeds\tto\tbe\tplanned\twith\ta\u00a0long-term\tperspective.\t\n\nEU support has recently focused on strengthening monitoring programmes in the EaP countries. In that \ncontext, the EU Copernicus Programme has the potential to accelerate and support quick and up-to-date \nmonitoring of various variables such as snowpack and land-use changes in the EaP countries. Developing the \nCORINE Land Cover Inventory for capital regions of the EaP countries has been initiated by the EU since 2016. \n\nImplementation of the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) for water \nin the EaP countries would provide essential inputs in the process of river basin characterisation and the \nimplementation\tof\twater\tservices\t(in\u00a0line\twith\tEU\tWFD,\tArticle\t5).\n\f\nOutlook\n\n60 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nIn the context of this report, in which the main focus \nhas been on strengthening implementation of the \nSEIS principles, the key activities for the future are \naddressed in line with the three pillars of the SEIS \n(see\u00a0also\tFigure\t6.1):\n\n\u2022 needs and opportunities for cooperation at the \nregional and national levels;\n\n\u2022 implementation of relevant content to support \nknowledge-based policymaking; and \n\n\u2022 further needs in improving the infrastructure for \ndata and information management.\n\n6.1 Regional cooperation\n\nThe European Green Deal will certainly change the \noverall approach to the challenges of climate change \nand biodiversity loss in the coming years.

All these pave the way towards \nthe IRWM to be put in place not only at the local or \nnational level, but also at the regional level, which \nis strategically important for the region's peace and \nsecurity. \n\nIn the coming years, the EU will place its emphasis on \nsupporting its immediate neighbours. The ecological \ntransition for Europe can only be fully effective if the \nEU's immediate neighbourhood also takes effective \naction (EC, 2019b). In that context, the European Green \nDeal and water diplomacy might be major stimuli for \nvarious socio-economic and environmental domains in \nthe EaP countries. \n\nThe ENI SEIS II East project has already achieved the \nadded value of mobilising the Eionet experiences \nand expertise which brings not only specific, in-depth \nscientific and technical competencies towards the \nsustainable management of water resources, but also \nan extensive knowledge of European know-how. This is \nessential to ensure the protection of water resources \nand freshwater ecosystems in the EaP countries. \n\n6.1.1 Cooperation in transboundary basins\n\nEU water legislation places the river basin management \napproach at the core of water management policy. \nThe EaP countries draft RBMPs in line with the EU \nWFD, starting with selected river basins and eventually \ncovering the whole country, many with international \nsupport. For example, Belarus and Ukraine prepared \nthe Upper Dnieper River Basin Draft River Management \nPlan with the support of the EU and EPIRB (European \nenvironmental protection of international river \nbasins) Environmental protection of transboundary \nriver basins (Koszta et al., 2016). With support from \n\nthe EPIRB project and the EUWI+ for the Eastern \nPartnership (EUWI+, 2019), which is developing a series \nof additional RBMPs, EaP countries are improving their \nknowledge and skills for developing and implementing \nRBMPs. These include: water body delineation and \ntypology; classification of the status of water bodies \nbased on available data; identification of data and \ninformation gaps to improve monitoring; delineation \nof protected areas; identification of pressures; risk \nassessment; proposing environmental objectives; \neconomic analysis and development of programmes \nof measures, stakeholders and public involvement; \nand awareness-raising activities. The main project \nbeneficiaries are the environment ministries, \nwhich gives hope that EaP countries will soon start \nestablishing management plans themselves (13). \n\nHowever, the countries still have a number of \nimportant institutional and managerial challenges \nto face. Specifically, attention should be given to \nthe establishment and functioning of river basin \ncouncils, the development of models and practices \nfor stakeholders and public involvement, the \ndevelopment of a sustainable funding mechanism \nfor\u00a0RBMP\timplementation,\tand\tthe\tproduction\tof\t\nrobust and reliable data. At the regional level, bilateral \nand multilateral cooperation on transboundary basins \nshould be strengthened both within the region and \nwith EU Member States and other relevant states. \n\n6.1.2 Interinstitutional and intersectoral cooperation\n\nAs the focus on water is a cross-cutting issue across \nthe natural environment, socio-economic development \nand public health and well-being concerns, water \nresources management cannot be undertaken in \nisolation. Implementing appropriate measures, either \nto ensure the sustainability of water resources and \nwater-dependent ecosystems or to secure the water \nsupplies on which society and the economy depend, \nwater management requires the involvement of \nnumerous stakeholders. As underlined by the OECD \n(OECD and UNECE, 2014), sectoral competition for \nwater in EaP countries is already intensifying as \nwater demands grow over time. These trends require \nurgent actions to be taken in various domains of \nwater resources management, including changes in \nthe legal framework, better integration of institutions \nand water-use sectors, the introduction of strategic \nplanning, greater financial sustainability, and the \ndevelopment of sufficient human resources. The \ncurrent national policy dialogues under the EU Water \n\n(13)  More information on the implementation of EU-funded projects at: https://www.euneighbours.eu/en/east/eu-in-action; see more information \non the EUWI+ at: https://euwipluseast.eu/en/\n\nhttps://www.euneighbours.eu/en/east/eu-in-action\f\nOutlook\n\n62 Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nInitiative are providing intersectoral and interagency \nplatforms to discuss strategic planning and reforms \nin\u00a0water\tsectors\tin\tthe\tEaP\tcountries.\t\n\n6.2\t Content-related\twork\n\n6.2.1 Monitoring programmes \n\nThe EEA's European environment \u2013 state and outlook \n2020 report (SOER 2020) (EEA, 2019c)Europe faces \nenvironmental challenges of unprecedented scale \nand urgency. Although EU environment and climate \npolicies have delivered substantial benefits over \nrecent decades, Europe faces persistent problems \nin areas such as biodiversity loss, resource use, \nclimate change impacts and environmental risks \nto health and well-being. Global megatrends such \nas demographic change are intensifying many \nenvironmental challenges, while rapid technological \nchange brings new risks and uncertainties. Recognising \nthese challenges, the EU has committed to a range \nof long-term sustainability goals with the overall \naim of 'living well, within the limits of our planet'. \nAchieving these goals will not be possible without \na rapid and fundamental shift in the character and \nambition of Europe's responses. Europe needs to \nfind ways to transform the key societal systems that \ndrive environment and climate pressures and health \nimpacts \u2014 rethinking not just technologies and \nproduction processes but also consumption patterns \nand ways of living. This will require immediate and \nconcerted action, engaging diverse policy areas and \nactors across society in enabling systemic change. \nEurope stands at a critical juncture in 2020. Its leaders \nhave opportunities to shape future developments \nthat will not be available to their successors. \nThe coming decade will therefore be of decisive \nimportance in determining Europe's opportunities in \nthe 21st century. These, in short, are the overarching \nconclusions of The European environment \u2014 state and \noutlook\t2020\t(SOER\u00a02020\thighlights\tthe\timportance\tof\t\n'comprehensive integrated assessment to date, and \nthe first to address rigorously systemic challenges\u2026'. \nThe EEA's Assessment of Assessments report also \npointed out that data and information on water and \nwater resources management in Europe has increased \ntremendously (EEA, 2011). There has also been a \nsimilar trend in the EaP countries. However, there \nis a strong need to adapt the content of monitoring \nprogrammes and data collection to modern IWRM, \nfor example, in line with the EU WFD. Similarly, \n\nwhereas data and information is relatively abundant \nin certain areas, such as water quality and streamflow, \nwater agencies are still far from integrating various \nsectoral data. The EaP countries are moving towards \ndeveloping the similar data model to that of the EU \nWFD and WISE State of Environment reporting, through \nEU support. As this process is long term, efforts must \nbe continued and tailored to the specific needs of each \nEaP\u00a0country\tin\tthe\tcoming\tyears.\t\n\nA key process concerns sharing available data and \ninformation among national water agencies, as well \nas with external stakeholders, along with integrating \nall data relevant to water resources management, \nwhile simultaneously enhancing countries' monitoring \ncapacities. This will help to provide a robust baseline \nfor developing and implementing water-focused \nenvironmental policies, not only at the national level, \nbut also at the regional level \u2014 an essential process \nin improving cooperation among transboundary river \nbasins. \n\nWith the experiences already available following \nimplementation of the EU WFD, as well as data \nharmonisation and sharing under Eionet, voluntary \ndataflow will bring tremendous inputs for national and \nregional data exchange in the EaP countries. \n\nInnovative monitoring technologies, including satellite \ndata, automated monitoring technologies, and \npotentially crowdsourcing of environmental data, \nhave great potential for improving data collection, \nreducing the costs of monitoring, and enhancing \nconfidence in EU WFD status classification (EC, 2019a). \nThe EU Copernicus programme (14) has the potential \nto expand its products over the EaP countries in the \nfuture. This may improve the effectiveness of the \nmonitoring programmes and produce reliable data and \ninformation via calibration and validation with in\u2011situ \ndata which have been developed under various EU \nfunded projects, for example, EUWI+. \n\n6.2.2 Capacity building \n\nIn many cases, even though the administrative \norganisation of water state services and agencies are \nin place and operational, competent expert capacity \nis crucial to appropriately interpret available data \nand information on water resources. This also builds \n'institutional memory' for accumulating knowledge and \nexperience essential in the area of IWRM. However, \n\n(14)  Copernicus is the EU's Earth Observation Programme providing data from satellite observation on our planet and its environment. See more \ninformation at: https://www.copernicus.eu/en\n\nhttps://www.copernicus.eu/en\f\nOutlook\n\n63Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\nstaff turnover, combined with frequent reorganisation \nin the water agencies or respective ministries, causes \nthe loss of such institutional memory and lowers the \nwater agencies' capacity to be effective. For instance, \nMoldova reorganised its Ministry of Environment three \ntimes between 2017-2019. Similarly, Georgia changed \nthe structure of its Ministry of Environment twice in the \nsame period. \n\n6.2.3 Supporting knowledge-based policymaking \n\nThe importance of using available data and information \nto support knowledge-based policymaking should be \nunderlined. A set of UNECE water indicators, C1-C5 \nand C10-C11, that has been used as the main inputs \nto developing this report, has been developed jointly \nwith national experts by following the EEA indicator \ntemplate. The overall purpose of this work was to build \ncapacity at the national and regional level in using \navailable water data to support knowledge-based \npolicymaking. Indicator development also emphasised \nstandardising and sharing the datasets needed for \nindicator composition. Further maintenance and \nsustainability of similar datasets should be ensured \nin the future. This includes mobilisation of water \ndata experts who deal with knowledge building and \nenvironmental assessment, as well as IT/data experts \n\nwho offer technical support in data processing, \ndissemination and sharing.\n\nThe United Nations SEEA Central Framework (UN, \n2012) integrates economic and environmental data to \nprovide a comprehensive view of the interrelationships \nbetween the economy and the environment, and \nthe stock of environmental assets. It contains \ninternationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, \nclassifications, accounting rules and tables for \nproducing internationally comparable statistics and \naccounts. It is a formally recognised statistical standard \nby UN member countries. As there is a sequential link \nbetween data collection, water accounts and indicators \n(Figure 6.2), developing the water accounts will help in \nthe design of monitoring programmes, organisation of \nthe databases, as well as streamlining and developing \nindicators in the EaP countries. In addition, developing \nthe water accounts will support the integration of \nenvironmental and economic data.\n\nFurthermore, the water accounts would provide \nessential inputs into the process of developing the \nriver basin district management plans \u2014 for example, \ncharacterisation of river basins and implementation \nof water services, as also stated in EU WFD, Article 5 \n(EC, 2015)as pre-requisite to sound and sustainable \nquantitative management of water resources.

It reflects that \nthe rate of change in water stored in a hydrological unit \n(e.g. catchment. \n\nAs the water accounts link environmental information \nwith economic data and information, defining the \nprogramme of measures can also benefit from input \nfrom the water accounts. With the EU's technical \nsupport, and as a pilot activity, Belarus has developed \nphysical water flow accounts for 2018, which are \npresented in Annex I. Azerbaijan also developed \nphysical water asset and flow accounts at the country \nlevel, with the technical support of the EEA. \n\n6.3 Infrastructure\n\n6.3.1 National data integration\n\nIn the EaP countries, water-monitoring systems are \nmainly implemented as a state service, divided into \nregional divisions in the areas of hydrometeorology \n(water quantity), geology (groundwater), \nhydrochemistry (water quality), hydrobiology (ecology) \nand public health (drinking water). Although all \ncountries have monitoring programmes on water \nresources and water use, the usability of that data \nin policymaking needs further evaluation and \nimprovement as the data are mainly collected and \nmanaged in a very fragmented manner among several \ngovernmental services and agencies. This often creates \nbottlenecks in the compilation and organisation of \nwater-quantity data \u2014 for example, in developing water \nasset and flow accounts with the aim of identifying \nwater availability and sectoral pressures on water \nresources (Globevnik et al., 2018).\n\nState statistical offices collect data on water resources \nan annual basis from various state water services and \nagencies and publish (bi)monthly bulletins or annual \nstatistical books. In the area of water quantity, in some \ncases, they simply do not collect the data on different \nvariables. For example, Ukraine's State Statistics \nCommittee only collects data on water abstraction. \nAs regards water quality, the respective water \nagencies inform on any exceedance of limit values \nbut do not deal with integrated status assessments \nand trends over long periods. Overall, water policy \nrecommendations are missing.\n\nState water services and agencies in the EaP \ncountries are generally very reluctant to share \ntheir data and information on different domains of \nwater management, which inhibits comprehensive \nintegrated assessments at both the national and \nregional level. The challenges ahead include: \n\ndeveloping a positive attitude towards data sharing; \nthe need to assess the environmental status of water \nresources, notably by regularly monitoring its decisive \nbiological quality elements; and identifying key \npressures on water. \n\nIt should be underlined that the integration of water \ndata from various sectors and sources will underpin \na\u00a0reliable\tand\trobust\tinterpretation\twith\tavailable\tdata,\t\nnot only to design the current policy and programmes, \nbut will also certainly support the development of \nIWRM in the region and at the local scale. \n\n6.3.2 Water Information systems\n\nThe EaP countries have advanced at different levels \nas regards either developing or using existing (water) \ninformation systems. For instance, Moldova is currently \ndeveloping an automated information system called \n'the State Water Cadastre'. The system is designed \nto host data and information on various areas of \nwater, for example, water resources, water resources \nmanagement, hydraulic structures, protected areas, \nwater balance, etc. The State Cadastre System will \nbe an integral part of the Integrated Environmental \nInformation System to increase efficiency in data \nprocessing and eliminating potential duplication in \ngathering information.\n\nAs a pilot activity under the EU-funded ENI SEIS II \nEast project, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have \ndeveloped water information systems (in Georgia) \nand the EcoPortal (in Armenia and Azerbaijan) by \nreplicating\u00a0the\toverall\tstructure\tand\tphilosophy\tof\t\nWISE.\n\nIn 2020, the information systems deployed in Armenia, \nAzerbaijan and Georgia offer the cooperating \ninstitutions the following functionalities:\n\n\u2022 a data dictionary and harmonised water-quality \ndataset, which enables dataset comparability \nbetween different institutions;\n\n\u2022 SQL database, data-processing protocols and \nprocedures for water-quality indicator production; \nand\n\n\u2022 a web portal, which enables the presentation of \ndata and information through text blocks, dynamic \nand interactive charts, and GIS visualisations.\n\nEffective use of the established information systems \ndepends on two key processes. These should be \nfollowed and reviewed once the systems have been \n\f\nOutlook\n\n65Water availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries\n\n(15)  Some development in that direction had already started under EUWI+ at the time this report was developed.\n\nin place for some time, enabling all the involved \nstakeholders to use them.\n\nThe first process is to enhance staff expertise in \nusing the information systems. The ultimate goal is \ncapacity building to establish a functioning team of \nboth water domain and IT experts working in synergy, \nand able to successfully communicate the issues and \nrequests. The institutional working procedures that \nuse the information system should be well established, \ndocumented on a centralised platform, and replicable.\n\nThe second process is that technical features of the \nportal should be reviewed for their efficiency and \nupgraded where needed. While the information \nsystems were built in a way to be easily upgraded, the \nfocus of further technical development should be on \nthe following (15):\n\n\u2022 Deployment of different databases containing water \ndata, thereby centralising national datasets and \nfacilitating their sharing; this would also reduce \nthe need for many data managers in individual \ninstitutions, largely missing now.\n\n\u2022 Establishment of data-management procedures; \nthis includes replicable processes of data collection, \nquality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), storage, \ndataset assessment, and the production of \ndissemination products (charts, maps, etc.); only \nbasic data-management procedures are currently \nin place, but can serve as a starting point to \ndevelop\u00a0processes\tfurther.\n\n\u2022 Development of more environmental indicators, \npotentially expanding beyond the topic of water; \nthese environmental indicators should be based \non\u00a0clearly\tdefined\tdata-analysis\tprocedures.\n\n\u2022 Collecting and managing spatial datasets, enabling \nspatial analysis and presentation of data on \ninteractive maps; currently, only basic spatial \npresentation is available in the existing information \nsystems.\n\n6.3.3 Data harmonisation with Water Information \nSystem for Europe (WISE)\n\nThere is a significant need for harmonised data \nand information to support cooperation in the \ntransboundary basins in the EaP countries, particularly \nin Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Efforts under the \nimplementation of EU-funded projects, such as ENI \nSEIS II East, aim to partly overcome the problem of \ndata and information availability and harmonisation \nat the regional level by developing water indicators \nusing the EEA's methodology, as has already been \nimplemented in EEA member countries. Data on BOD \nand nutrients in the EaP countries have already been \nharmonised with WISE in accordance with the WISE \ndata dictionary. However, wider implementation of this \ndata harmonisation in the respective national water \nagencies and the expansion of data harmonisation to \nwater quantity still requires further development in the \nfuture. Efforts by the EUWI+ under the development \nof RBMP plans may support data harmonisation at the \nregional level. \n\f\nWater availability, surface water quality and water use in the Eastern Partnership countries66\n\nReferences\n\nAsian Development Bank, 2005, Country Environmental \nAnalysis\u2014Azerbaijan, Manila, Philippines (https://www.\nadb.org/documents/country-environmental-analysisazerbaijan) accessed 31 March 2020.\n\nBelstat, 2020, 'News', National Statistical Committee of \nthe Republic of Belarus (https://www.belstat.gov.by/\nen/) accessed 31 March 2020.\n\nBisselink, B., et al., 2020, Climate change and Europe's \nwater resources, Technical report No EUR 29951 EN, \nJoint Research Centre, (https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/\njrcsh/files/pesetaiv_task_10_water_final_report.pdf) \naccessed 6 February 2020.\n\nBrown, A. and Matlock, M., 2011, A Review of Water \nScarcity Indices and Methodologies, The Sustainability \nConsortium (https://www.sustainabilityconsortium.org/\ntsc-downloads/a-review-of-water-scarcity-indices-andmethodologies/) accessed 31 March 2020.\n\nCouncil of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, 2016, \nState programme \u201cComfort accommodations and an \nenabling environment for 2016\u20112020, Republic of \nBelarus (http://www.government.by/upload/docs/\nfile8c3586a94739667b.PDF) accessed 21 April 2020.\n\nDniester-Commission, 2020, 'Website of the Dniester \nCommission', Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, \n(https://dniester-commission.com/en/) accessed \n31\u00a0May\t2020.\n\nEBRD, 2016, 'Yerevan Water Supply Improvement \nProject', European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (https://www.ebrd.com/work-with-us/\nprojects/psd/yerevan-water-supply-improvementproject.html) accessed 6 July 2020.\n\nEC, 2008, Communication from the Commission to \nthe Council, the European Parliament, The European \nEconomic and Social Committee and the Committee \nof the Regions 'Towards a Shared Environmental \nInformation System (SEIS)' (COM(2008) 46 final) of 1 \nFebruary 2008.\n\nEC, 2015, Guidance document on the application of water \nbalances for supporting the implementation of the WFD, \nTechnical Report -

situations, as determined by their primary causes and their \nduration\u00a0or\tfrequency.\n\nAvailable water resources That part of surface water and groundwater resources that is available for use (EC, 2015d).\n\nDrought A drought refers to a temporary water shortage. A meteorological drought starts with reduced \nlevels of precipitation compared with normal. When prolonged, this may then cause reduced \nlevels of soil moisture in agricultural land (agricultural drought) and reduced levels of natural \nwater flows to surface water and groundwater (hydrological drought). Long-term drought \nconditions (e.g. seasonal or year round) cause aridity, whereas longer periods of drought \n(multi-annual) may cause desertification.\n\nRenewable freshwater \nresources\n\nThe average annual amount of precipitation less evapotranspiration that ends up as run-off \nto rivers and recharge to aquifers (internal flow), and the average amount of inflow of surface \nwaters and groundwater from neighbouring countries minus the outflow of surface water and \ngroundwater into neighbouring countries and into the sea (UNECE, 2020).\n\nWater consumption The part of water used that is not returned to groundwater or surface water because it is \nincorporated into products (e.g. food and beverages) or consumed by households (e.g. drinking \nwater) or livestock. It is calculated as the difference between total water use and total supply to \nother sectors\u00a0+\u00a0returns to surface water and groundwater. Thus, it may include transpiration \nof water from crops, the losses due to evaporation during distribution and the apparent \nlosses due to unauthorised tapping and malfunctioning meters. The term is equivalent to \n'consumptive water use' (adapted from UN (2012)).\n\nWater scarcity Water scarcity defines a mid-term water stress condition (e.g. seasonal, annual or multi-annual) \noccurring when the water demand for human needs frequently exceeds the sustainable \nsupply capacity of the natural system in river basins. Water scarcity is the consequence of \nanthropogenic impacts on the availability of water resources. Water scarcity can be measured \nas the ratio between renewable freshwater resources and water abstraction or water use.\nThe occurrence of droughts in river basins exacerbates the impacts of water scarcity on both \necosystem and socio-economic conditions (as regards resilience, maintenance and  \nrestoration/development).\n\nWater shortage Water shortage is a short-term water stress condition (e.g. monthly or seasonal) occurring \nwhen the water demand for human needs exceeds the supply capacity of the natural system in \nriver basins. When this happens frequently the term water scarcity is used.\n\nWater stress Water stress refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet the human and ecological demand \nfor water. Compared with scarcity and shortage, water stress is a more inclusive and broader \nconcept. As well as water scarcity, it also considers water quality, ecological flows and the \naccessibility of water (The Global Compact, 2014).\n\nWater supply Delivery of water to end users, including self-supply for own final use (EC, 2015d).\n\f\nGlossary \n\n8 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nWater use The total volume of water intake by a socio-economic activity (e.g. water intake for household \nneeds, including drinking water, irrigation of crops, cooling at industrial and energy production \nplants). Water use includes both consumptive and non-consumptive activities. Consumptive \nactivities result in evaporation and transpiration of water or its integration into products. \nNon-consumptive activities use water and then return it to surface water and groundwater but \nwith potential changes to its physico-chemical properties. Water use may incorporate excess \nwater intake ('water waste'), which does not serve the needs of the activity (adapted from \nUN\u00a0(2012).\n\nWater use efficiency The ratio of either the net or the gross value added of a socio-economic activity and its \nwater\u00a0consumption.\n\nSummary overview schema\n\nDuration or \nfrequency of \nwater\tstress\u00a0\n\nCauses of water stress\n\nVolumetric availability of water \nis\tlower\tthan\tlong\u2011term\u00a0average\n\nDemand for water exceeds available water\n\nNatural Anthropogenic Anthropogenic\n\nDue to \nmeteorological \n\nconditions\n\nDue to \nchanging \nclimatic \n\nconditions\n\nVolumetric \nwater demand \nfor ecological \n\nflows not \nfully\u00a0met\n\nVolumetric \nwater \n\ndemand of \nsocio-economic \n\nsectors not \nfully\u00a0met\n\nWater quality \nrequirements of \nsocio-economic \n\nsectors not \nfully\u00a0met\n\nAccessibility is a \nlimiting factor for \nsocio-economic \n\nuse\n\nTemporary or \nincidental\n\nDrought Water shortage\n\nMid-term or  \nfrequent\n\nDrought/aridity Water scarcity\n\nLong-term or \npermanent\n\nAridity/desertification Desertification\u00a0(a)\n\nNote: This report provides an overview and assessment of temporary and mid-term drought and scarcity in Europe (the aspects indicated in \nbold),\tnot\tincluding\taccessibility\tand\tthe\taridity\tand\tdesertification\taspects\tof\twater\tstress\t(indicated\tin\tgreen).\n\n(a) Gleick and Palaniappan (2010) also describe the peak water concept as a limiting factor in the availability of water to meet socioeconomic and ecosystem demands.\n\f\n9Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\nKey messages\n\nCurrent status: water stress in Europe is significant.\n\n\u2022 Water stress affects 20\u00a0% of the European territory and 30\u00a0% of the European population on average every year, \nwhile droughts cause economic damage of up to EUR\u00a09\u00a0billion annually and additional unquantified damage to \necosystems and their services.\n\n\u2022 Southern Europe faces severe water stress problems, which occur throughout the year in many river basins, \nwith water consumed by agriculture, public water supply and tourism being the key pressure on water resource \navailability. The pressures from these economic sectors reach a significant seasonal peak in summer.\n\n\u2022 In other parts of Europe, water stress is usually not a permanent issue, as it mainly occurs occasionally and in \nspecific hotspots, where the key pressures are water consumed by cooling processes in electricity and industrial \nproduction, public water supply and mining.\n\n\u2022 Water use efficiency has increased in agriculture, electricity production, industry, mining, public water supply and \ntourism. Water consumption by these sectors was 16\u00a0% lower in 2017 (the last year for which EU-wide statistics are \navailable) than in 1995 (baseline), while production in these sectors grew by 20\u00a0% in terms of net value added.\n\n\u2022 The 2000 EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) provides a suitable framework for acting on the policy options to \nreverse water scarcity and drought, as set out in the Commission communication on water scarcity and drought, \nbut their implementation has been slow. The 2021 EU strategy on climate change adaptation could provide a new \nimpetus to achieve this goal.\n\nFuture prospects: water stress in Europe is expected to worsen.\n\n\u2022 Droughts are increasing in frequency, magnitude and impact.\n\n\u2022 Climate change is projected to cause seasonal reductions in water availability in most parts of Europe, except in \nnorth-eastern areas. The strongest impact is expected in southern and south-western Europe, with river discharge \nreductions in summer of up to 40\u00a0% in some basins, under a 3\u00a0\u00b0C temperature rise scenario. Large parts of western \nand central Europe will also be affected, albeit to a lesser degree. Changes in aquifer recharge follow roughly the \nsame pattern.\n\n\u2022 Improved water use efficiency could deliver a further reduction in water abstraction of 0.7\u00a0% per year over the \ncoming years in the agricultural, industry and mining, and electricity production sectors.\n\n\u2022 Although helpful, this will neither offset the climate change impacts on rainfall-dependent nature and on \nagriculture nor offset any strong local increases in water demand (see next point).\n\n\u2022 Continued urbanisation and growth in coastal tourism will further concentrate water demand geographically. \nA\u00a0warmer and drier climate could increase irrigation requirements by 20\u00a0%, adding to a stronger concentration of \nwater demand in already drought-prone regions of Europe.\n\f\nKey messages \n\n10 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nSolutions: potential EU-level actions to reduce water stress The opportunity offered by the WFD to manage water \nstress needs to be urgently realised. In particular, continued efforts will need to be made by EU Member States to \ndevelop drought management plans and coordinate or integrate them with the WFD river basin management plans.\n\n\u2022 Drought management should be based on long-term strategies for proactive water management and should make \nthe transition from crisis management to risk management by, for example, putting more emphasis on demand- \nversus supply-side measures.\n\n\u2022 Initiatives and actions under the European Green Deal should also be used to support water stress management, \nincluding: the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, in particular with regard to the restoration of freshwater \necosystems, restoration of river continuity, revision of water abstraction permits and implementation of ecological \nflows; the new EU circular economy action plan; the 2020 EU Water Reuse Regulation incentivising efficient \nwater use through water pricing and enabling water reuse; and the 2021 EU climate change adaptation strategy \nincorporating climate risk into investment and policy decisions.\n\n\u2022 Sectoral policy interventions must be coherent and coordinated with the WFD and EU water directives to ensure \nthe effectiveness of the latter. This refers to aligning not only strategic objectives but also legal requirements as far \nas possible.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of water stress are felt at local and regional scales, while its drivers act from regional to global scales. \nLinking these levels of analysis requires systemic thinking.\n\n\u2022 Data collection and information flows must be further improved and tailored to the spatial and temporal scales at \nwhich water stress makes itself felt.\n\f\n11Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\nExecutive summary\n\nThis report aims to update our knowledge of water stress \n(a general term that includes drought and water scarcity) in \nEurope to inform policymakers and interested stakeholders \nabout the current state of play. It presents arguments for a \nshift from crisis management to risk management, including \nby putting more emphasis on demand-side measures, such \nas increasing water use efficiency or organising information \ncampaigns. In order to minimise the impacts of water stress on \npeople and ecosystems across Europe, ecosystem resilience \nneeds to be improved, and the water use efficiency of our \nsocio-economic systems needs to be increased. For both of \nthese issues policies and regulations at EU level are in place, but \ntheir implementation and effectiveness need to be improved. \nAs pointed out in The European environment \u2014 state and outlook \n2020\t(SOER\u00a02020)\t(EEA,\t2019j),\tthere\tare\tmany\tindications\tthat\t\nthe environment in Europe has reached the point at which, \nbecause of the long-term overexploitation of natural resources, \nrelatively small changes in external conditions can provoke \nconsiderable and irreversible changes in environmental quality \nand the supply of natural resources. These would in turn lead \nto permanent negative impacts on nature, the quality of life and \nthe economy and other associated systems, which would all be \ndifficult and very costly to reverse.\n\nWater stress in Europe\n\nWater stress occurs when there is not sufficient water available \nto meet the demands of the environment and our society and \neconomy, in terms of quantity or quality. Water stress is a \ngeneral term combining drought, quantitative scarcity, water \nquality and water accessibility. Drought reflects the shortage of \nwater due to short- or long-term precipitation deficits. Droughts \npropagate through the hydrological cycle and, depending on \ntheir duration and intensity, may lead to such effects as low \nsoil moisture content, decreasing groundwater levels, saltwater \nintrusion, deteriorating water quality and reduced river \ndischarges. Through these effects on the hydrological cycle, \ndroughts may lead to impacts on human well-being, socioeconomic development and ecosystems.\n\nWater stress was not perceived as a Europe-wide problem \nuntil the early 2000s. It was regarded as a problem that mostly \noccurs in southern Europe because of the regional climatic \n\nconditions. However, currently available information and data \nshow that droughts and water scarcity are no longer rare or \nextreme events in Europe. The frequency of water stress is \nincreasing, and the affected area is expanding towards central \nand western Europe, affecting an increasing number of areas \nimportant for industry and electricity production, as well as \naffecting more large cities and thus millions of inhabitants. \nToday,\ton\taverage,\tevery\tyear\twater\tstress\taffects\taround\t20\u00a0%\t\nof\tthe\tEuropean\tterritory\tand\t30\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\tpopulation\t\n(EEA,\u00a02018b).\n\nThe drivers of water stress are usually a combination of \ngeographically widespread factors, such as climate change \nimpacts and the location of tourism and food production, and \nconsumption chains, electricity production and population \ndensity. This cross-cutting nature of the water stress issue calls \nfor coordinated action among the different policy areas.\n\nPolicy context\n\nThe EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a legal \nframework at the EU level aiming, inter alia, to prevent further \ndeterioration of aquatic ecosystems and the ecosystems \ndepending on them and to achieve sustainable water use based \non the water resources available in the long term. The WFD \nsupports integrated water management and sets out provisions \nto\timprove\tthe\tefficiency\tof\twater\tuse.\tThrough\tits\tArticles\u00a01,\t\n9 and 11 the WFD creates a suitable flexible frame for action \nagainst water stress, underscoring the relation between water \nquantity, water quality and ecological status.\n\nTo respond to the increasing occurrence, frequency \nand impacts of water stress, in 2007 the EU adopted a \ncommunication on water scarcity and drought in an effort to \nbring more clarity to the policy priorities for addressing water \nstress. The communication's implementation was reviewed in \nseveral stages, and in 2012 'A blueprint to safeguard Europe's \nwater resources' was published. Along with the policy provisions \nput forward in these two strategic documents, the EU Resource \nefficiency roadmap, the common agricultural policy (CAP) and \nthe Seventh Environment Action Programme also announced a \nnumber of policy mechanisms aiming to protect and enhance \nEuropean natural capital and water resources.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\nThe implementation of those policies has contributed to some \npositive developments, for example a decrease in total water \nabstraction in Europe (EEA, 2019l, 2021d; Eurostat, 2020f). \nNevertheless, policies addressing water stress remain scattered, \nand overall progress has been slow. Building on a paradigm \nshift that originated in the 1980s, EU water scarcity and drought \npolicy has begun the transition from crisis management to \nproactive risk management. However, this transition has been \nmostly conceptual, as through its implementation, the change \nin paradigm exposed a lack of institutional capacity in many \nMember States.\n\nToday, some Member States develop and implement \ndrought management plans complementary to the river \nbasin management plans (RBMPs) under the EU WFD. The \nimplementation of the RBMPs has taken place at variable \nspeeds across the EU Member States and the various WFD \nthematic areas, and there are still gaps to be addressed \nin the next cycles of implementation. Despite the recent \nimplementation of measures, more time is needed for all water \nbodies in Europe to achieve good status (EC, 2019b), while the \nfinal deadline of 2027 (where exemptions to the obligation \nexpire) is coming near.\n\nThe WFD recognises the cross-cutting character of water as a \nvital resource for environmental and socio-economic systems. \nSimilarly, the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable \ndevelopment has pointed to the need for systemic change that \npermeates recent EU policy, highlighting the importance of \ncollaboration and policy integration and coherence. In practice, \nSustainable\tDevelopment\tGoal\t(SDG)\tTarget\u00a06.5\tpromotes\t\nintegrated\twater\tmanagement\tand\tTarget\u00a06.4\thighlights\tthe\t\nneed to increase water use efficiency across all sectors and \nto decouple economic growth and water use. In this context, \nseveral new policy initiatives in Europe are on the eve of \nbeing implemented. The European Green Deal sets ambitious \ntargets and objectives to protect, conserve and enhance the \nEU's natural capital. The new EU strategy on adaptation to \nclimate change calls for expedited action to safeguard access \nto freshwater and ensure sustainable use as part of the 'faster \nadaptation' objective. The new circular economy action plan \nand the Water Reuse Regulation explicitly address water \nstress and water scarcity, respectively, and include provisions \nfor improving resource efficiency in the context of managing \nwater resources. Similarly, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 \nacknowledges the importance of natural capital to industry \nand agriculture and sets quantitative targets for ecosystem \nrestoration, including restoring 25\u00a0000\u00a0km\tof\tfree-flowing\t\nrivers. Furthermore it requests Member States to review water \nabstraction and impoundment permits and to implement \necological flows, so that they can achieve good status or \npotential in all water bodies by 2027. The EU sustainable finance \ntaxonomy includes criteria on reducing the rates of water \nabstraction and on reducing hydromorphological pressures. \nThe new Climate Change Law (which at the time of writing this \nreport is being prepared for formal adoption), the sustainable \nfinance taxonomy (EC, 2018a), the farm to fork strategy, the \n\n\u00a9 Gurhan Sahin, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n13Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nnew CAP Pillar\u00a0II and the Eighth Environment Action Programme \nall call for increasing resource efficiency, protecting our \nnatural capital and improving human well-being by means \nof transitioning the European economy to become more \nsustainable by target years ranging from 2030 to 2050.\n\nIn the context of water stress, all of these policy provisions and \ninitiatives require strong coordination and collaboration during \nthe implementation phase across sectors and ecosystems. So \nfar, major obstructions to more effective policy implementation \nare the institutional frameworks and capacity, which are \nnot adequate to promote coordinated, cross-sectoral action \nand measure progress. The European Green Deal and the \nnew EU strategy on adaptation to climate change, 'Forging \na climate-resilient Europe' (EC, 2021a), represent fresh \nopportunities to tackle this problem, by integrating water stress \nand drought policy objectives into other policy areas, increasing \ncoherence and speeding up implementation.\n\nRenewable freshwater resources under a \nchanging climate\n\nClimate change is a major factor influencing the availability of \nrenewable freshwater resources. The last few decades some \nof the hottest and driest years of the two last centuries have \nbeen recorded, and the annual average temperature in Europe \nhas\talready\tincreased\tto\t1.6-1.7\u00a0\u00b0C\tabove\tthe\tpre-industrial\t\nlevel (EEA, 2020d). The temperature rise increases potential \nand actual evapotranspiration, causes more frequent extreme \ndroughts, intensifies heavy precipitation, attenuates snowpack \nbuild-up and triggers early snow melting. These effects have \nled to a decrease in annual precipitation in parts of southern \nEurope (EEA, 2017d) and decreasing river discharges, leading \nto increasing water stress. In contrast, in north-eastern and \nnorthern Europe, precipitation and the intensity of heavy \nprecipitation in winter and summer is increasing (EEA, 2019b), \nleading to increasing annual river discharges in those regions \n(EEA, 2016e). This trend is expected to continue in the coming \ndecades (Feyen et al., 2020). A decrease in the depth of the \nsnowpack in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains and earlier \nsnow melt at lower altitudes in the Alps can already be \nobserved, while recent summer droughts have struck areas \nreaching as far north as the Arctic circle.\n\nFreshwater use under socio-economic change\n\nThe population of European urban centres continues to \nincrease further, while the population in rural areas decreases. \nThis leads to the development of more peri-urban land to meet \nadditional needs for residences and workplaces. Moreover, \ntourism in Europe has reached record levels over the last \ndecade and this has resulted in the rapid conversion of land \nfor the development of touristic facilities and the supporting \ntransport infrastructure. Urban sprawl accelerates in coastal \nareas, which are also vulnerable to future sea level rise. The \n\nexpansion in impervious areas and land sealing increases \nthe risks of urban floods and drains away water that could \notherwise recharge local aquifers (EEA, 2019e, 2020a).\n\nIn\t2017\talmost\t250\u00a0billion\u00a0m3\t(250\u00a0000\u00a0million\u00a0m3) of freshwater, \ncorresponding\tto\t9\u00a0%\tof\tannual\trenewable\tfreshwater\t\nresources, was abstracted in Europe for socio-economic \npurposes. After use, treated or untreated water is returned \nto surface water and groundwater. The average return ratio \nof cooling water from industrial and electricity production \nis\taround\t80\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\twater\tabstraction,\twhile\tagriculture\t\nreturns\taround\t30\u00a0%,\tand\thydropower\talmost\t100\u00a0%.\tHowever,\t\nreturned water may cause chemical or thermal pollution of \nthe receiving water bodies. The water that does not return to \ngroundwater or surface water bodies after its use is considered \nconsumed by the relevant sector (e.g. through evaporation \nand transpiration or integration into tissues and products). \nThe\tmajor\twater\tconsumers\tare\tagriculture\t(58\u00a0%),\telectricity\t\nproduction\t(18\u00a0%),\thouseholds\tand\tservices\t(13\u00a0%)\tand\tmining,\t\nquarrying,\tconstruction\tand\tmanufacturing\t(11\u00a0%).\n\nIn many European river basins, water is overabstracted, \nleaving insufficient water for ecological processes, or returned \nto surface water and groundwater with significant levels of \npollution. Only three EU Member States (Cyprus, Hungary and \nthe Netherlands) have been implementing measures to protect, \nenhance or promote ecological flows in all river basin districts \nas proposed in the WFD common implementation strategy in \n2016, whereas France has implemented the ecological flows \nin\ttwo\triver\tbasin\tdistricts\t(EC,\t2019b).\tIn\t2015,\t58\u00a0%\tof\triver\t\nwater bodies had not achieved good ecological status, for which \nwater abstraction was reported as one of the main pressures \nin\t8\t%\tof\triver\twater\tbodies\tnot\tachieving\tgood\tecological\t\nstatus. Groundwater levels have already fallen at various \nsites across EU Member States (EEA, 2018a). Groundwater is \noften seen as a buffer resource, which can be used to supply \nhigh-quality drinking water, especially when local surface \nwaters are not suitable for exploitation or at times of water \nstress. Unauthorised water abstraction may be a result of \nincomplete application of ecological flows, their insufficient \ncontrol and legal enforcement, and the application of flat tariff \nsystems instead of volumetric tariff systems for irrigation \n(Buchanan\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\t2019).\n\nWater consumption in Europe shows a trend towards \ndecoupling from economic growth, as water use efficiency has \nincreased in water-dependent sectors, such as agriculture, \nelectricity production, industry, mining, public water supply \nand tourism. Water consumption in the above sectors was \n16\u00a0%\tlower\tin\t2017\tthan\tin\t1995,\twhile\tproduction\tin\tthese\t\nsectors\tgrew\tby\t20\u00a0%\tin\tterms\tof\tnet\tvalue\tadded.\tNevertheless,\t\nthe issue of water stress continues to escalate. Climate \nchange exacerbates seasonal variations in water availability. \nAt the same time, particularly in southern Europe, in some \nwater-dependent sectors, such as agriculture, demand is \nincreasing in drier periods of the year, for example water \ndemand for irrigation purposes is increasing in spring and \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n14 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nsummer, when water availability is at its lowest level. This \ncauses increasing competition for water among economic \nsectors, often pushing users to shift from using surface \nwater, leading to greater uptake from groundwater resources \nand ultimately exerting pressure on water bodies and the \necosystems\tdepending\ton\u00a0them.\n\nThe observed decreasing trend in water abstraction volumes \nhas so far not translated into an improvement in the \nquantitative status of water bodies. This may be partly due to \nthe slow process of recovery and also to climate change, which \ncan offset volumetric gains and aggravate local pressures.\n\nImportantly, despite progress, many challenges need further \naction. There is significant potential to save water across all \neconomic sectors, but large investments are needed to unlock \nit. Monitoring, metering and authorisation of water abstractions \nand understanding the environmental interactions in river \nbasins have progressed overall. Ecological flow requirements \n(e-flows) are better defined than they were, although they have \nstill not reached a satisfactory level. Enforcement of e-flows \nhas improved, yet there is still a long way to go to achieve full \nimplementation of the WFD requirements and establish e-flows \nacross all EU rivers. Leakages in the conveyance systems are \nstill\tmore\tthan\t25\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\twater\tsupply\tin\tmany\teastern\t\nand southern European countries (ERM, 2013). Unauthorised \nabstractions are persistent in some Member States. \nFurthermore, attention to and enforcement of water legislation \nis needed to avoid the rebound effects of the implementation \nof these water-saving measures: a situation in which efficiency \ngains result in less than a proportional decrease or even \nin an increase in net resource consumption (see Box 6.5 in \nChapter\u00a06).\n\nWhile local water resources are getting more stressed or \ndepleted, increasing urbanisation increases the local demand \nfor water, which is often met by implementing storage and \nwater transfer projects. Such projects have significant impacts \non hydromorphology and associated freshwater habitats \nand\u00a0species.\n\nPromising approaches and measures\n\nThe analysis of the future gap between water availability \nand water demand in Chapter 5 of this report points to the \nincreasing impact of water stress in southern Europe and \nin some parts of the other regions of Europe. This finding \nis consistent with earlier studies, such as the Joint Research \nCentre's\tPeseta\u00a0IV\tstudy\t(Feyen\tet\tal.,\t2020).\tThe\tincreased\t\nseasonal variation in water demand for key socio-economic \nactivities is at odds with the increased seasonal variation in \nwater supply, and the variability caused by climate change \nforces Member States to explore additional measures to \nensure their water supplies. Approaches focusing on valorising \nunconventional resources (i.e. desalination, water reuse, \nrainwater harvesting) are already implemented in many \n\nMember States. In this context, it is worth mentioning the new \nEU Water Reuse Regulation (EU, 2020b), which sets minimum \nquality requirements for water reuse in agricultural irrigation. \nThe regulation has been in force since June 2020 and the rules, \nwhich will start applying in June 2023, are expected to facilitate \nthe harmonised uptake of this practice across the EU.\n\nThe EU is dedicated to innovation as a means to tackle the water \nscarcity challenges identified. In fostering innovation, it gives \nparticular focus to better monitoring of the Earth and its climate, \nbetter data management, better socio-environmental modelling, \nimprovements in hydrological and drought forecasting, better \ntechnologies for increasing technical water efficiency, better \ntools for controlling water demand and better technologies for \nenabling\tand\tpromoting\talternative\twater\u00a0sources.\n\nA systemic analysis of water stress drivers, pressures and impacts \ncan help researchers, water practitioners and policymakers \nto develop a wider and more holistic understanding of the \ninterdependent relationships (nexus) between water, energy, \nland, materials and ecosystem services and of their further \nrelationships with climate and production-consumption systems \n(e.g. food, energy and mobility systems). Adopting separate \npolicy goals and management practices for each of these \nsystems can create trade-offs, in which the benefits from using \none resource may critically limit the benefits from using another \nresource. Integrated management responses can generate  \ncompromise solutions that deliver working results for sustainable \nmanagement of both resources. Furthermore, win-win synergies \ncan be explored to reap the benefits from the use of more \nthan one resource: for example, water reuse can reduce the \nneed for groundwater abstraction from overexploited aquifers, \nas well as the need for fertilisation because of the nutrient \ncontent of reclaimed water; the increased energy needed for \nreclaiming water can be offset by the reduction in energy needed \nfor pumping groundwater and for producing and applying \nfertilisers,\u00a0etc.\n\nNature-based solutions, as recently inventoried by Wild et al. \n(2020), need to be further explored and implemented. While the \nnumber of options dedicated to water stress appears limited, \nthe associated approach and stakeholder involvement offer \na way forward for integrative solutions to complex problems. \nNatural water retention measures and aquifer recharge are \namong the most promising options.\n\nNeed for integrated policy responses\n\nMainstreaming water considerations into other environmental \nand sectoral policies and finding synergies across them are \nkey to enabling sustainable water management and reducing \nsociety's exposure and vulnerability to water stress. The recent \nWFD fitness check has highlighted that one of the key factors \ncontributing to the effectiveness of the EU water directives \nin progressing towards their objectives is the (binding) \ncross-references to the WFD's objectives in other EU policies.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n15Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nThe recent adoption of the Water Reuse Regulation is a good \nexample of integrated thinking. The new CAP programming \ncycle for 2021-2027 provides a fresh opportunity to \nintegrate more ambitious environmental safeguards \nthat acknowledge local water resource limitations and \nscarcity\u00a0situations.\n\nThe new farm to fork strategy illustrates how the European \nGreen Deal aims to promote a transition to more sustainable \nfood systems by incorporating a systems approach. \n'Sustainable food systems' maintain production and \nconsumption throughout the full value chain within ecological \nlimits, and thus they can keep the impacts of water use in \nagricultural food production within sustainable limits in terms \nof water quantity and quality. Systemic thinking to reduce \nEurope's vulnerability to water stress still has to permeate \nthe policies of other economic sectors such as energy and \nindustry, although some safeguards already exist.\n\nSeveral EU policy initiatives support the use of nature-based \nsolutions to reduce Europe's vulnerability to water stress. The \nEU strategy on adaptation to climate change 2021 (EC, 2021a) \nstrongly advocates nature-based solutions as a means to \nimprove compliance with the requirements for good ecological \nstatus and as solutions that can enhance water supply while \ngenerating co-benefits in a cost-effective way. The strategy \nrecognises the importance of integrated solutions to tackle \nwater stress, and it aims to expand on its predecessor's \nachievements on awareness-raising and mainstreaming climate \nadaptation concerns into EU policy, as well as shifting the \nfocus towards rolling out and scaling up solutions to increase \nthe resilience of communities and regions. While recent \nassessments indicate that the synergies between water scarcity \nand drought policies and climate change adaptation strategies \nhave not been fully exploited at Member State and river basin \nlevels (EC, 2019f), the new adaptation strategy has the potential \nto change this.\n\f\n\u00a9 Norbert Kerekes, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\n17Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\n1 \nIntroduction\n\n1.1 Setting the scene\n\nWater is vital for the three pillars of Europe's sustainable \ngrowth: its society, its economy and its environment. All three \ndepend on an adequate supply of water of sufficient quality \nat the right time and in the right location. However, in many \nparts of Europe, a mismatch has evolved between the demand \nfor water and the volume of available water, resulting in water \nstress (Box 1.1).\n\nThis report addresses existing and future water stress \nconditions and risks in Europe, their potential impacts on the \nenvironment, society and economy, and the options for action \nthat are open for exploration.\n\nDroughts and water shortages have hit hitherto unexpected \nlocations, as occurred in western and northern Europe in 2018 \n(see Box 1.4). Some more recent drought events in areas that \nare normally not perceived as prone to droughts occurred in \nthe Arctic circle and Siberia in 2020 and 2019, the Elbe river \nbasin in the summer of 2015 and the Black Sea area in 2007.\n\n1.1.1 Impacts of droughts on habitats and species\n\nThe latest State of nature in the EU report (EEA, 2020h, 2020i) \nshows\tthat\t5.4\u00a0%\tof\thabitats\tand\t4.6\u00a0%\tof\tspecies\tare\tcurrently\t\naffected by climate change as a pressure. Of all cases related \nto climate change, almost half are associated with droughts \nand decreases in precipitation.

Of the animals, the most affected are \nthe amphibians, which are very sensitive to shifts in both \ntemperature and precipitation, and then molluscs, specific \nmammals and birds associated with reedbeds and reedy ponds.\n\nAs climate change is increasing temperature and changing \nprecipitation patterns, it is expected that the risks for \nbiodiversity will increase. The loss of existing habitats, the \ncreation of favourable conditions for species alien to European \necosystems and the amplification of issues with invasive species \nare predicted to cause additional pressures for biodiversity in \nthe future.\n\nIt is estimated that the average area of Europe affected by \nsevere\tdroughts\tis\taround\t121\u00a0000\u00a0km2 for the years between \n2000 and 2016 (Figure 1.1). However, the annual area was \nhighly variable, depending on the meteorological conditions \nthat year, and ranged between 5 000 and 350 000 km2 over \nthe said period. The worst affected land use types included \nforests, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation associations, \nheterogeneous agricultural areas, arable land and permanent \ncrops. The most affected geographical areas were the Iberian \nPeninsula and south-western France, measured in terms of \nboth extent of the areas under water deficit and decline in \nvegetation growth. In addition, a large part of central Europe \nand the Balkans (e.g. Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia) \nwere affected by water deficits that caused a decline in \nvegetation growth (EEA, 2020b).\n\nBox 1.1 Terms related to water stress\n\nWater stress is the general term used in this report for \nthe situation in which the amount of available water \nis not sufficient to meet the local demand (including \nenvironmental demand). Water stress can be caused by \na volumetric shortage, by insufficient water quality, by \ndroughts or by insufficient accessibility.\n\nWhen water stress is caused by anthropogenic factors \nand when it has a mid-term duration (typically several \nmonths) or occurs frequently, the term 'water scarcity' \nis used. The term 'water shortage' is used when water \nstress has a relatively short duration (weeks to months) \nor occurs occasionally. Water scarcity and shortage are \naggravated by drought. Drought is, in principle, a natural \nphenomenon, related to meteorological variability, but \nclimate change adds an anthropogenic component to it. \nSee also the glossary.\n\nIn parts of southern Europe and in densely populated areas \nacross the EU, water stress is a permanent, year-round \nproblem. In other parts of Europe, water stress occurs only \ntemporarily or even only occasionally. These differences \nare a result of the geographical and temporal variation in \nmeteorological conditions, which affect water availability, and of \nthe water demand of ecosystems and society and the economy.\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n18 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n1.2 Environmental impacts of \nfreshwater\u00a0abstraction\n\nThe main impacts of water abstraction on groundwater bodies \nare imbalances in the water table or lowered water tables \nand saline intrusion (Psomas et al., 2021).

Both types of abstraction may \ncause pollution with chemicals, nutrients and organic material \nthrough return flows, either to groundwater or surface water \nbodies (EEA, 2018d).

The problem has existed for decades, leaving a legacy of \noverexploited aquifers across the country. The problem is also related to the existence of 'senior water rights' (i.e. old \nwater rights granted decades ago), which have not been revised to take account of up-to-date studies on water balances \nand requirements. Overabstraction has affected various riverine and wetland ecosystems.\n\nThe Do\u00f1ana National Park is an important coastal wetland, designated a Unesco World Heritage site, which lies at the \ndelta\tof\tthe\tGuadalquivir\triver\tand\tcovers\taround\t54\u00a0000\u00a0ha\tof\tlagoons,\tsalt\tmarshes,\tfixed\tand\tmobile\tdunes,\tscrub\t\nwoodland and maquis. Overabstraction in the past has resulted in a decline in the groundwater tables in several parts of \nthe region, the depletion of temporary ponds, a decrease in local stream flows and a reduction of groundwater recharge. \nIn coastal areas, the groundwater-seawater equilibrium has been distorted, resulting in saline intrusion. The Do\u00f1ana \narea is also affected by discharge of nutrients, chemicals and heavy metals originating from upstream industrial activities. \nThe depletion of aquifers and the decrease in stream flows limits their capacity to dilute and flush out pollutants, thus \nincreasing pollution problems such as eutrophication. Overall, the natural ecosystem faces negative impacts, which \nmay be observed in alterations in the composition of vegetation (e.g. an increase in xeric shrubs, pine trees and juniper \nwoodland), reductions in invertebrate communities (e.g. dragonflies), declines in populations of fish, molluscs and birds \nspecies\t(e.g.\u00a0wintering\tand\tnesting\tducks,\tcoots)\tand\tthe\tspread\tof\tinvasive\talien\tspecies\tto\tthe\tdetriment\tof\tnative\tspecies.\t\nThe river basin authorities have launched several proceedings over identified breaches and closed a limited number \nof unauthorised wells in the past. However, in 2019, the European Commission decided to refer Spain to the European \nCourt of Justice for taking insufficient action and for alleged breaches of the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats \nDirective. On June 24, 2021, the Court ruled that Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under Art. 5(1) and 11 of the WFD \n(EU, 2021).  \n\nFurthermore, research studies on Spanish rivers have also shown that the natural flow regime has been significantly \naltered in various river basins. Overabstraction has turned normally free-flowing rivers into intermittent flowing streams, \nand fish assemblages have been seriously affected at sites with high pressure from water abstraction. Reductions in \ncarbon storage and breakdown of organic material and reductions in populations of shredder insects were also observed \nin mountain streams affected by overabstraction.\n\nNotes: The Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge is undertaking  several actions in order to improve \nthe control of  groundwater abstractions, as for example, the modification of the characteristics of the concession granted \nto El Fresno Guadalquivir irrigation community which lets the closing of 170 wells in Do\u00f1ana which will stop the extraction of \n4.26\u00a0Hm3/year\tof\tground\twater*,\tthe\tstricter\tcontrols\tof\tgroundwater\tabstractions\tand\tthe\tclosing\tof\tillegal\twells\tmade\tby\tthe\t\nRiver Basin Authority and SEPRONA, the police unit committed to prosecute environmental crimes. Recently,  SEPRONA has \ncarried out in different parts of Spain out the operation called MIZU, in which  1 457 illegal installations have been detected, of \nwhich 1 410 are wells and 47 ponds and 2 198 offenses have been imposed by SEPRONA during the execution of this operation.\n\n *https://www.chguadalquivir.es/-/el-gobierno-entrega-a-la-comunidad-de-regantes-el-fresno-guadalquivir-la-concesion-de-riegoque-permitira-el-cierre-de-170-pozos-en-el-entorno-de-dona \n**https://www.guardiacivil.es/es/prensa/noticias/7213dmg.html\n\nSources: Mu\u00f1oz-Reinoso (2001); WWF (2006, 2016); Benejam et al.

Water-dependent terrestrial ecosystems, such \nas wetlands, have been under serious pressure in the past \ndecades. It is estimated that two thirds of European wetlands \nwere lost before the 1990s, and their area has decreased \nfurther since, but the loss seems to have levelled off between \n2006 and 2012 (EEA, 2020b). As mentioned above, the status of \nwaters and ecosystems is affected by a variety of pressures. The \nfailure of such freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems to achieve \ngood status is mainly a result of pollution pressures. However, \nincreased temperature and evapotranspiration, decreased \n\f\nIntroduction \n\n22 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n1.3 Socio-economic impacts of water stress\n\nWater stress has negative impacts on the water-dependent \neconomic sectors (for more detailed information, see \nChapter\u00a04).\tIn\tagriculture,\tdroughts\tcan\tlead\tto\tlow\tsoil\tmoisture\t\ncontent, causing losses of crop yields. If the groundwater \nstorage is depleted, drinking water supplies may be disrupted, \nwhich can damage high-added-value sectors such as tourism \nand water-dependent industries. Similarly, low discharges in \nrivers may affect water-dependent electricity production in \n\nthermal and nuclear power plants or hydropower facilities and \nreduce the depth of water in free-flowing rivers, affecting inland \nshipping. In the third quarter of 2018, authorities were forced to \nstop river transport in Germany because of the severe drought \nthat summer (see also Box 1.4). This had a serious negative \nimpact on Germany's economic production, as it halted not \nonly transport but also production of industrial commodities \n(Ellyat, 2019). In addition, there are cases where the drawdown \nof groundwater tables has caused damage to buildings or \ninfrastructure because of land subsidence (see Box 1.2).\n\nBox 1.4 The drought of 2018 in central and northern Europe\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2018, central and northern Europe experienced severe drought conditions, as a result \nof a combination of exceptionally warm temperatures and low precipitation (Map 1.2). Indeed, many Member States in \nthese areas recorded one of their three hottest and driest summers ever. In contrast, southern Europe and particularly the \nIberian Peninsula recorded a wetter than usual spring and summer (Eurostat, 2019b).\n\nMap 1.2  The Combined Drought Indicator for the last 10-day period of July 2018 (left) and the second 10- day \nperiod of August 2018 (right)\n\nThe Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) for the last 10-day period of July 2018 (left) and the second 10-day period of August 2018 (right)\n\nFull recovery of vegetation to normal conditions\n\nPartial recovery of vegetation\n\nWatch: rainfall deficit\n\nWarning: soil moisture deficit \n\nAlert: vegetation stress following \nrainfall/ soil moisture deficit\n\nNo data\n\nOutside coverage\n\n0 500 1 000 1 500 km\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\u00a9ESRI\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n31/07/2018 20/08/2018\n\nSource: European Drought Observatory (JRC, 2020).\n\nThe 2018 drought affected farmers throughout northern Europe. The 2018 yields of cereals, potatoes, sugar beet and other \ncrops that account for a large share of crop production in northern European countries were much lower than those in 2017. \nDrought also heavily affected pasture (generally not irrigated), which had detrimental effects on the livestock and diary sector.\n\nThe drought also had severe impacts on other socio-economic sectors (Harris, 2018; Toreti et al., 2019), for example \nhigher than usual death rates among elderly people, difficulties in cooling power plants, stability issues in the Dutch dike \nsystem due to lack of freshwater, extremely low river levels, with negative impacts on the transport sector and industries \ndependent on waterway transport, and forest fires.\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n23Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nWater stress may create tensions between different \nwater users (Box 1.5), river basin districts or even \ncountries with respect to water management decisions \n(e.g. transfers, drainage), their impacts and the \nallocation\u00a0of\tcosts.\n\nEconomic damage from droughts is estimated to be in \nthe\torder\tof\tEUR\u00a02-9\u00a0billion\tannually,\tnot\tincluding\tthe\t\nunquantified damage to ecosystems and their services \n(EEA,\t2020c;\tMaes\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\t2020).\n\nBox 1.5  Civil associations and municipalities \nin Spain challenge water management \ndecisions disproportionately affecting \npublic water supply and urban citizens\n\nRelocation of public water supply in the Jucar \nriver\u00a0basin\t\n\nDiffuse agricultural pollution significantly affected \ntwo aquifers in the Jucar river basin designated for \nthe supply of drinking water. The authorities decided \nto relocate the drinking water supply to a local \nsurface water body and charge the costs to the nine \nmunicipalities that would be serviced. The municipalities \nreferred the issue to the Supreme Court of Spain, \nwhich required better implementation of the Water \nFramework Directive polluter-pays principle. Thus, \nfarmers were expected to bear part of the costs through \nthe environmental costs embedded in the water tariffs.\n\nFriction over the definition of ecological flow in \ndownstream areas of the Tagus \n\nThe friction between environmental and economic \nwater demands is also illustrated by the case of the \nTagus River Basin Management Plan. The current plan, \nin force from 2015 to 2021, did not effectively take \naccount of environmental water demand, favouring \ncertain economic functions abstracting and consuming \nhigh volumes of water (especially irrigated agriculture). \nIn 2016, a group of civil associations and representatives \nof local municipalities submitted a legal challenge to \nthe plan. In its 2019 ruling, the Spanish Supreme Court \nannulled the plan's provisions on ecological flows and \nrequired the Tagus River Basin Authority to enact urgent \ninterim measures to cover the period until the start of \nthe next planning cycle in December 2021.\n\nSources:  de Marcos Fern\u00e1ndez (2016); Mlinaric \nand\u00a0Rhodes\u00a0(2018).\n\nBox 1.6 The water exploitation index plus (WEI+)\n\nThe WEI+ is an advanced geo-referenced \nimplementation of the WEI developed by the EEA \nat river basin level and seasonal resolution (EEA, \n2018b).

The report addresses the \ntrends in water availability under changes in climate, water \nabstractions and water use efficiency, including their impacts on \nthe environment and on the main water-dependent economic \nsectors (agriculture, electricity production, manufacturing \nand domestic water supply). The report also explores the \ndecoupling\u00a0(1) of sectoral water abstraction from economic \ngrowth, future water availability and water demand, and it \nevaluates the potential effectiveness of current responses to \nwater stress.\n\n(1) Decoupling refers to the ability to sustain economic growth while reducing the amount of resources used, such as water or fossil fuels, and \nstopping environmental deterioration at the same time. Decoupling may be relative (indicating decreasing resource use per unit of production \nvalue) or absolute (absolute decrease in resource use while production value increases).\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n24 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nThe DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses) \nframework was used as the analytical framework for developing \nthe report (Figure 1.2). Hence, this report starts with climate \nchange and socio-economic development as key drivers of \nwater availability and water demand. An overview of water \nstress-related EU policy responses is included in this report. \nMeasures and policy responses can address any of the \nDPSIR\u00a0steps.\n\nThis report is structured around seven chapters in line with the \nDPSIR framework to address various aspects of water stress \nissues and the impacts of multi-drivers on European water \nresources and EU policy responses (Figure 1.3).\n\nChapter 2 describes the European policy context, that is, \nthe policies implemented for water stress management, \nsectoral and environmental policies with a link to water use \n\nFigure 1.2 DPSIR schema for water stress addressed in the report\n\nSource: Adapted by H.

It provides insights and assessment \nthat might also be relevant at local and national levels where \nwater stress is a prevailing issue. Traditionally water stress \nconcerns water users and water managers, as they are the \nprincipal stakeholders. However, the diversity of the audience \nis increasing. Water stress and its expected adverse economic \nconsequences increasingly attract the attention of the finance \nand insurance sectors (EEA, 2020c). The World Economic Forum \nhas listed 'extreme weather' as one of its top 5 risks with the \nhighest likelihood of occurring since 2014 and as one of its \ntop-5 risks with the highest impact since 2017. The urgency \nand magnitude of the challenge is also stated in a World Bank \nreport (World Bank, 2016) which, among other things, indicates \nthat, by 2050, water-related losses could result in a decline of \nup\tto\t6\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tgross\tdomestic\tproduct\t(GDP)\tin\tsome\tregions.\t\nThe adverse impacts of water abstraction on the environment \nhave driven water stress and drought issues up the list of \npriorities of societal organisations, such as the Right to Water \ncitizen initiative (Right to Water, 2021), and of nature protection \nnon-governmental organisations (NGOs), such as the WWF \n(World Wide Fund for Nature) and IUCN (International Union for \nConservation of Nature) (Tr\u00e9molet S. et al., 2019), while water \nscarcity risks are addressed in the annual plans of multinational \ncompanies such as Intel (Aquatech, 2019), Coca-Cola and \nUnilever. The water footprint assessment has played an \nimportant role in raising awareness of the implicit role of water \nin global economic production and trade. Several networks of \nprivate enterprises (e.g. World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment, Carbon Initiative, and Beverage Industry \nEnvironmental Roundtable) have taken steps to incorporate \nwater into the scope of their corporate social responsibility \ninitiatives, as has the European Water Stewardship scheme. All \nthis goes to demonstrate that water stress is no longer the sole \nconcern of water management authorities and direct water \nusers. The 'newly involved' stakeholders can have a crucial role \nin the design and implementation of nature-based solutions, \nas illustrated by the NAIAD project on the insurance value of \necosystems (Section 6.4).\n\n1.7 Relevance to other EEA activities\n\nThis report builds on a long chain of earlier EEA assessments \nand reports. A prominent predecessor is the 2009 report Water \nresources across Europe \u2014 confronting water scarcity and drought \n(EEA, 2009). The current report is an update of that report. \nCompared with the 2009 report, the current report adds recent \ndata, an update on  trends in water availability and use, and \nthe cross-links with related sectors and disciplines, updates on \npolicies and measures, and proposals for solutions.\n\nAmong many others, the following reports have been used as \ninputs in developing this report: \n\n\u00a9 Igor Popovic, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n27Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n\u2022 Effectiveness of urban wastewater treatment policies in selected \ncountries: an EEA pilot study (EEA, 2005); \n\n\u2022 Towards efficient use of water resources in Europe \n(EEA,\u00a02012b);\t\n\n\u2022 Water resources in Europe in the context of vulnerability \n(EEA,\u00a02012c);\t\n\n\u2022 Assessment of cost recovery through water pricing \n(EEA,\u00a02013a);\t\n\n\u2022 Public participation, contributing to better water management: \nexperiences from eight case studies across Europe (EEA, 2014); \n\n\u2022 Water-retention potential of Europe's forests: a European \noverview to support natural water-retention measures \n(EEA,\u00a02015);\t\n\n\u2022 Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in \nEurope: enhancing coherence of the knowledge base, policies \nand practices (EEA, 2017a); \n\n\u2022 Landscapes in transition: an account of 25 years of land cover \nchange in Europe (EEA, 2017d); \n\n\u2022 Water management in Europe: price and non-price approaches \nto water conservation (EEA, 2017f); \n\n\u2022 European water: assessment of status and pressures \n(EEA,\u00a02018a);\t\n\n\u2022 Climate change adaptation in the agriculture sector in Europe \n(EEA, 2019a); \n\n\u2022 Industrial waste water treatment: pressures on Europe's \nenvironment (EEA, 2019c); \n\n\u2022 Monitoring and evaluation of national adaptation policies \nthroughout the policy cycle (EEA, 2020g); \n\n\u2022 State of nature in the EU (EEA, 2020h); \n\n\u2022 Water and agriculture: towards sustainable solutions \n(EEA,\u00a02021c).\t\n\n(2)  All EEA indicators can be found at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/#c0=30&c12-operator=or&b_start=0\n\nFinally, The European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020: \nknowledge for transition to a sustainable Europe (EEA, 2019j) \npresents a comprehensive analysis of the above elements and \noffers perspectives on a systems approach.\n\nOver recent years the EEA has put a lot of effort into collecting \nand organising data for the development of water accounts and \nindicators supporting the assessment of the state of European \nwaters (EEA, 2019l). Furthermore, two important reports \non establishing water accounts have been published by the \nEuropean Topic Centre on Inland, Coastal and Marine Waters \n(ETC/ICM, 2016; Zal et al., 2017). This report makes considerable \nuse of the results of those efforts, most notably the Core Set of \nIndictors\t(CSI)\ton\twater\tand\tclimate\tchange\u00a0(2).\n\nAlong with the abovementioned reports, assessments \nfrom a number of the EEA water-, climate-, land- and \nbiodiversity\u00a0related\tindicators\thave\tbeen\tused\textensively.\t\nDatabases on the state of the environment, EEA dashboards on \nvarious topics (EEA, 2018d, 2019i) and the Eurostat database \nhave also provided quantified assessments of the status of and \npressures on Europe's water resources. \n\f\n\u00a9 Aykut Ince - Valla Canyon, Turkey\n\f\n29Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\n2 \nPolicies on water stress\n\n2.1 Water stress in EU water policy\n\nWater stands among the oldest and most advanced policy areas \nin the EU environmental acquis (Josefsson, 2012; Giakoumis and \nVoulvoulis, 2018). Since 2000, the Water Framework Directive \n(WFD) (EU, 2000) has been the EU's flagship legislation on water, \nunder which the wide variety of EU regulatory instruments, \nstrategies and policy mechanisms that have emerged and \nevolved over decades are coordinated. Under the WFD, the \nEU has set an overall aim to 'ensure access to good quality \nwater in sufficient quantity for all Europeans, and to ensure \nthe good status of all water bodies across Europe' (EU, 2000). \nArticle\u00a01\tof\tthe\tWFD\trequires\tthe\tMember\tStates\tto\t'promote\t\nthe sustainable use of water resources based on the long-term \nprotection of available water resources' and 'ensure a balance \nbetween abstraction and recharge of groundwater, with the aim \nof achieving good status of groundwater bodies'. Through these \nrequirements, the WFD sets the basis for action against water \nstress, and it underscores the relation between water quantity, \n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 Globally, and in Europe, policy instruments, measures and strategies being devised to address water stress are shifting from crisis \nmanagement to proactive risk management approaches.\n\n\u2022 The Water Framework Directive provides a suitable, flexible regulatory framework for action against water stress, underscoring the \nrelation between water quantity, water quality and ecological status. However, this framework is not exploited to its full potential.\n\n\u2022 Despite the publication of the European Commission's communication on water scarcity and drought in 2007 and the Blueprint to \nsafeguard Europe's water resources in 2012, EU policy on water stress remains scattered and the implementation of policy options \nand recommendations has been slow.\n\n\u2022 In the second river basin management plans (RBMPs), 16 Member States reported that water abstraction is a significant pressure \nfor their surface water or groundwater at least in some parts of their national territory. However, only eight Member States \nreported having drought management plans as documents accompanying all or part of their RBMPs and only three Member States \nhad developed ecological flows in all rivers.\n\n\u2022 The European Green Deal, the new circular economy action plan and especially the new EU strategy on adaptation to climate \nchange renew previous calls for mainstreaming water stress policy objectives, and forthcoming actions under these initiatives \nrepresent fresh opportunities to increase coherence and promote implementation.\n\nwater quality and ecological status. The fitness check of EU \nwater legislation concluded that the WFD provides a suitable, \nflexible frame for the planning for and management of drought \nrisk and the impacts of water scarcity events (EC et al., 2019).\n\nThe management of water stress across Europe has \ntraditionally focused on supply-side measures, while drought \nmanagement has been characterised by crisis management \nmeasures. Driven by shifts in the study of vulnerability and risk \nthat originated in the 1980s (Vargas and Paneque, 2017), and \nunderpinned\tby\tglobal\tdevelopments\tsuch\tas\tthe\tYokohama\t\nstrategy for a safer world (UN, 1994) and its successors, the last \nthree decades have increasingly seen the adoption of strategies \nthat shift the focus towards water demand management. In \naddition, there is increased emphasis on the need for a more \nproactive risk management approach against droughts, calling \nfor a drought management approach articulated around \naspects of preparedness, crisis management and resilience \nbuilding (Box 2.1).\n\f\nPolicies on water stress \n\n30 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nOverall, EU policy on water stress has evolved around three \nsupplementary pillars: (1) EU legislation (e.g. WFD, Groundwater \nDirective, Floods Directive, new Water Reuse Regulation), \npolicy initiatives (e.g. communication on water scarcity and \ndrought, circular economy action plan, Roadmap to a resource \nefficient Europe, EU strategy on adaptation to climate change) \nand\tsectoral\tpolicy\tinstruments\t(e.g.\tPillar\u00a0II\tof\tthe\tcommon\t\nagricultural policy (CAP) and the regional environmental policy \nCivil Protection Mechanism) (Figure 2.1).\n\nThe WFD itself establishes, at river basin scale, an integrated \nplanning framework to enhance protection and improvement \nof the aquatic environment with the ultimate goal of achieving \ngood environmental status in European waters. A key product \nof the WFD planning process is the river basin management \nplan (RBMP), which is accompanied by a programme of \nmeasures. The WFD recognises the cross-cutting character \nof water as a vital resource for environmental, social and \neconomic systems, which puts water policy at the centre of \ndevelopments in other policy areas. To tackle water stress, the \nWFD puts more emphasis on acting on the drivers underpinning \nwater demand (i.e. reducing demand from economic sectors \n\nBox 2.1 Important terms in water \nstress\u00a0management\n\nPreparedness: monitoring of long-term water resources \nto evaluate the water-related risks and corresponding \nplanning to effectively manage the anticipated water \ndeficits, while also considering the risks from probable \ndrought events.\n\nCrisis management: activation of predefined \nemergency plans and measures to deal with critical \nwater deficits during drought events.\n\nResilience building: development of the necessary \nknowledge base, awareness, governance structure and \ntechnical infrastructure to support preparedness for \nand crisis management of drought risks (e.g. raising \nawareness on water security concerns; providing \ncapacity building and training; climate-proofing \nof socio-economic activities and areas; employing \nnature-based solutions for climate change adaptation; \nintegrating ecosystem services into finance and \ninsurance schemes dealing with water stress).\n\nWater stress, water scarcity and drought: the general \nterm, included in the glossary and most widely used \nin this report, is water stress. However, as the titles of \nrelevant guidance documents include the terms 'water \nscarcity' and 'drought', those are used in this chapter too.\n\nFigure 2.1 Timeline showing major policy \ndevelopments related to water stress \nsince the adoption of the WFD\n\nNote: F2F, Farm to Fork; FD, Floods Directive; WS&D, Water \nScarcity and Droughts.\n\n2000\n\n2007\n\nWFD into force\n\nWS&D addressed under\n\nFD into force\n\nFollow up reports on 2007 Communication\n\nCAP reform initiation\n\nReview of the EU WS&D Policy\n\nEU strategy on adaptation to climate change\n\nReformed CAP comes into force\n\nEnd of first WFD management cycle\n\nFitness check of the EU Water Legislation\n\nEU Green Deal\n\nEU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030\n\nF2F Strategy\n\nCircular Economy Action Plan\n\nEnd of 2nd WFD management cycle\n\nEU Climate Adaptation Strategy\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n20082010\n\nconsuming water) than on increasing water supply. The WFD \nencourages abstraction control through permits, water demand \nmanagement and efficient water use.\n\f\nPolicies on water stress \n\n31Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nHowever, supply-oriented infrastructure, including reservoirs \nor diversions (inter-basin transfers), have also been planned \nin recent years by many Member States (e.g. Austria, Bulgaria, \nCroatia, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain) \nin response to their concerns on water and energy security or to \nshift their local water supply to alternative sources, because of \nthe depletion and degradation of local groundwater (Buchanan \net al., 2019).\n\nIn 2007, the European Commission published its \ncommunication on water scarcity and drought (EC, 2007a), \nwhich outlines seven concrete policy options to address water \nscarcity and drought at European, national and regional levels:\n\n\u2022 putting the right price tag on water;\n\n\u2022 allocating water and water-related funding more efficiently;\n\n\u2022 improving drought risk management;\n\n\u2022 considering additional water supply infrastructure;\n\n\u2022 fostering water-efficient technologies and practices;\n\n\u2022 fostering a water-saving culture in Europe;\n\n\u2022 improving knowledge and data collection.\n\nThe communication calls for a 'water efficient and water saving \neconomy' that integrates 'water issues into all sectoral policies'. \nThere is an explicit recognition that economic development, \nin the form of, for example, new urban areas, industrial \nproduction capacities or irrigation perimeters, must take \ninto account the availability of local water resources to avoid \nexacerbating water stress and the risk of damaging droughts. \nThe implementation of the policy options promoted by the \ncommunication was assessed in three annual follow-up reports \nand a policy review (EC, 2008, 2010, 2011b).\n\nThree additional policy documents addressing water stress and \ndroughts explicitly have since been published:\n\n\u2022 The Blueprint to safeguard Europe's water (EC, 2012) \nre-emphasised the need to take action against water stress. \nIt integrates a particular focus on the need to increase \nresource use efficiency and decouple growth from resource \nuse, drawing on the 2011 Roadmap to a resource efficient \nEurope (EC, 2011a) and recently re-emphasised in the \nnew circular economy action plan (EC, 2020b) under the \nEuropean Green Deal (EC, 2019e).\n\n\u2022 The EU strategy on adaptation to climate change (EC, 2013) \nserved to establish reference points and define new aims \nto increase climate resilience and disaster preparedness. \nThis was closely linked to efforts to improve drought \n\nrisk management under the 2007 communication and \npreparation of drought management plans (DMPs) by \nMember States (EC, 2007a).\n\n\u2022 In 2021, the European Commission adopted a new EU \nstrategy on climate change adaptation (EC, 2021a). This \nnew policy explicitly seeks to accelerate the development \nand roll-out of solutions to safeguard the availability of \nfreshwater. It recognises the need for action to ensure the \navailability and sustainable use of freshwater resources \nand calls for protecting water quality in the face of climate \nchange to guarantee a stable and secure supply of drinking \nwater. The strategy was conceived in the belief that climate \nchange impacts will affect all economic sectors and all \nsocial groups, and so policy mainstreaming and systemic \nchange are prominently featured. It resonates with the \n2007 communication on water scarcity and drought in \nthat it emphasises the need for climate-informed and \nfuture-proofed investment and policy decisions, for \nimproved collection of and access to climate-related \nrisk and loss data, for fostering efficient water use in the \ndomestic, agricultural and industrial realms, for promoting \ndrought management planning, and for setting water prices \nthat adequately reflect the value of the resource.\n\nUndertakings at the EU level to support water stress \nmanagement have resulted in achievements in the form of \nresearch, policy options and technical guidance (Herv\u00e1s-G\u00e1mez \nand Delgado-Ramos, 2019). However, the EU policy approach \ntowards water quantity is generally less well developed than it \nis for water quality (Stein et al., 2016; Eslamian and Eslamian, \n2017), and the pace of change in this specific policy area has \nbeen slow.\n\nDeveloping comprehensive and incentive regulatory \nframeworks and incentive pricing mechanisms is as important \nfor facilitating the uptake of new technologies as developing the \ntechnical solutions themselves (Buchanan et al., 2019). Recently, \ngeneral considerations on water stress have been integrated \ninto the European Green Deal, the biodiversity strategy for \n2030, the farm to fork strategy, the 2030 climate and energy \nframework, the new circular economy action plan and the 2050 \nlong-term strategy. Elements of water security and insurance \nare also embedded in the EU's sustainable finance taxonomy. \nFor instance, as outlined in environmental objective\u00a03 of the \ntaxonomy on the 'sustainable use and protection of water \nand marine resources', investment in economic activities that \nmake a substantial contribution to reducing the rates of water \nabstraction or reducing hydromorphological pressures without \nsignificantly hindering the achievement of the taxonomy's five \nother environmental objectives will classify as sustainable. \nTechnical screening criteria to determine when a contribution \ncan be considered substantial will be adopted at the end \nof 2021 and applied from 2023 onwards. Similarly, the new \nEU strategy on adaptation to climate change makes explicit \n\f\nPolicies on water stress \n\n32 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nreference to the issues of water availability and sustainable \nuse. Thus, a proportion of the 100 demonstrators of adaptation \nsolutions that are considered in the mission proposal A climate \nresilient Europe\u00a0(3) will be partly or fully oriented towards \nincreasing resilience to water impacts. The challenge will \ncontinue to be transposing the principles and provisions of the \nnew policy initiatives and making them operational, as well as \nscaling up the solutions demonstrated.\n\n2.1.1 Implementation challenges\n\nTo date, the management of water stress remains largely a \nnational policy, but it operates within a multi-level governance \nscheme in which different administrative levels play distinct \nroles. In keeping with the subsidiarity principle, the WFD and \nEU water scarcity and droughts policy provide a framework for \nintegrating and building on Member States' knowledge of local \nconditions while avoiding short-term regional or local interests \nputting the future needs of the wider community at risk. This \neffectively means that the EU complements the regulation and \nmanagement responsibilities of local and regional authorities \n(EU Committee of the Regions, 2011). Nonetheless, there could \nbe cases in which the responsible public administration fails \nto develop a long-term strategy looking beyond the 6-year \nmanagement cycles of the WFD and building effectively on the \nRBMPs (Buchanan et al., 2019).\n\nOn the one hand, authorities and stakeholders in many \nMember States have scaled up collaboration in planning and \nmanagement, leading to greater policy integration of water \nstress issues at local and regional levels. This triggered action \nfrom some Member States, and the latest DMPs were accepted \nin 2018. The compliance assessment of the second RBMPs \n(EC,\u00a02019b)\tshowed\tthat\t15\tMember\tStates\tand\tthe\tUnited\t\nKingdom reported water abstraction as a significant pressure \nfor their surface water or groundwater at least in some parts \nof\ttheir\tnational\tterritory\u00a0(4) . However, only seven Member \nStates and the United Kingdom reported having DMPs as \naccompanying\tdocuments\tto\tall\tor\tpart\tof\ttheir\tRBMPs\u00a0(5) . \nFurthermore, the content of these plans and the depth of \nthe analysis differ greatly among Member States, despite the \nexistence of a relevant technical report on the development \nof DMPs (EC, 2007b). Cyprus and Spain are two countries with \nvery detailed and comprehensive DMPs accompanying their \nRBMPs. Some elements of these plans are regarded as novel \nand promising (Herv\u00e1s-G\u00e1mez and Delgado-Ramos, 2019). \n\nThe assessment of the second RBMPs also showed that EU \nMember States with significant pressures from abstraction in \ntheir territory may have gaps in their knowledge of the exact \nvolume of water abstracted at river basin level either because \nof unauthorised abstractions or lack of metering devices \nor because of the exemption of 'small' abstractions from \nreporting (EC, 2019b).\n\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that progress in \nimplementation has been slow since the publication of the \nBlueprint to safeguard European waters back in 2012. The \ntransition from crisis to risk management approaches has \nbeen mostly a conceptual one, as during its implementation \nthis change in paradigm has exposed a lack of institutional \ncapacity across many Member States (Tsakiris, 2015). \nFurthermore, to be truly effective, the risk management \napproach has to be adopted by all sectors that have a direct \nor indirect influence on water, for example through decisions \non land use (EU Committee of the Regions, 2011). It will be \nimportant to renew efforts on this, especially in areas with \nrecurrent drought issues, as the impacts of temporary drought \nevents can last much longer than the initial phenomenon \nand their socio-economic damage can be considerable. The \nEuropean Green Deal and the forthcoming actions under \nthe new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change are \nopportunities to do so.\n\nBetween the first and second WFD planning cycle, water \npricing was applied more widely by EU Member States, and \nnew pricing schemes were introduced in various sectors \n(e.g.\u00a0drinking\twater\tand\tsanitation,\tagriculture,\tindustry).\t\nHowever, although incentive pricing is an explicit requirement \nof the WFD to ensure compliance with its principles and \nobjectives, the current pricing mechanisms do not always \nprovide adequate incentives for efficient water use and \nsustainable water management (Buchanan et al., 2019).\n\nOne of the findings of the fitness check of the WFD was \nthat implementation should be increased and budget for \nit should be secured in the Member States. Often, the key \nreason for delays in the implementation of measures tackling \nwater stress is a lack of secure budgets. Implementation \nrelies largely on the public budget, and the capacity of EU \nfunds is not always fully exploited (Buchanan et al., 2019). \nThe coordination of the EU CAP and the rural development \nplans is a good example here, as highlighted by EEIG Alliance \nEnvironnement (EC, 2020f).\n\n(3) The mission proposal aims to 'support 200 communities to develop solutions for transformative adaptation, and scale up 100 deep \ndemonstrations of climate-resilience' (EC, 2020a).\n\n(4) Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain.

However, the accumulation of all of these \nsmall abstractions over a large area could result in a significant \npressure (e.g. on local groundwater bodies), which is disregarded. \nSimilarly, in some areas, there are issues with the overallocation \nof water rights that were issued before the adoption of the WFD. \nAlthough the WFD has provided significant motivation for local \nauthorities to review pre-existing water rights and to revise them \naccording to the overexploitation problems identified, Member \nStates usually have difficulty in intervening in case of permits \nthat were granted a long time ago and what are known as 'senior \nwater rights'. As a result, most Member States have become \nstricter when issuing newer water permits (Buchanan et al., 2019; \nEC,\u00a02020f).\n\nCombined, these barriers slow down progress in achieving the \nWFD's objectives and limit the ambitious implementation of \nEU water scarcity and drought policy. There is thus a continued \nneed to address issues such as policy integration, coherence \nand compliance (EC, 2015d, 2020f).\n\n2.2 Sectoral policy responses and their links to \nwater stress\n\nBeyond the dedicated water policies that have been the main \nfocus of this chapter so far, a wide range of sectoral and \nenvironmental strategies, instruments and measures are in \nplace that directly or indirectly address the impacts of water \nstress and drought. These include policies in the fields of \nagriculture, energy, industry, transport, biodiversity, nature \nprotection and climate change.\n\nThe European Green Deal has largely managed to encapsulate \nglobal developments advocating systemic change, and its \nongoing action plan intends to enable (deep) sustainable \ntransitions in Europe. The strategy recognises the need to \n'restore the natural functions of ground and surface water' \nand tackle the 'excessive consumption of natural resources'. \nIt sets out a number of industry reforms aligned to foster \nthe transition towards circularity and towards a greener and \nresource-efficient economy. At a macro-level, the Green Deal \n\naims to increase sustainable finance and channel public and \nprivate investment into sustainable activities and projects. The \nuse of cross-cutting instruments such as the EU sustainable \nfinance taxonomy is highlighted in the Green Deal, as it aims to \nestablish financing standards to increase the efficient use and \nprotection of \u2014 among other things \u2014 water resources across \nthe European economy.\n\nAgriculture is the sector with the highest water consumption \nand was one of the worst hit in the recent drought events of \n2018 and 2019. Impacts on the sector include loss of yields, \nincreased costs of water supply and irrigation, and heightened \npotential for tensions, disputes and even conflict between \ncompeting users. The sector's flagship policy, the CAP, is \nundergoing a reform process that includes readjusting its focus \nto incorporate better water management into farm practices. \nUnder the Rural Development Regulation, also known as \nPillar\u00a0II of the CAP, a set of measures, including training and \nfarm modernisation, to promote water efficiency are concrete \nelements widening the scope of agricultural practice to increase \nenvironmental protection and improvement.\n\nIn the energy sector, common impacts include reduced \nenergy production in thermal plants due to low river discharges \n(and reduced access to cooling water), decreased electricity \nproduction in hydropower plants due to low reservoir levels, \nand increased electricity prices. The Commission's reiterated \ncommitment to achieve climate neutrality and fully decarbonise \npower\tgeneration\tby\t2050,\twith\t80\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU's\tpower\t\ngenerated from renewable sources, creates expectations of \nfuture changes in the sector's water demand. Links to water \nstress in the Renewable Energy Directive (EU, 2009a) and the EU's \nenergy union strategy (EC, 2015a) are indirect and mainly stem \nfrom integrated climate and energy planning and monitoring of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The recent EU strategy for energy \nsystem integration 2020 (EC, 2020d) includes consideration of \nthe water footprint of EU energy production and the potential for \nsustainable production of bioenergy from wastewater.\n\nThe industrial sector includes manufacturing operations \nand mining and quarrying, which are in many cases activities \nwith a high water demand. Impacts of imbalances in water \navailability include restrictions on production plants and even \nplant shutdowns in highly water-dependent operations. Policy \nresponses in this sector have focused primarily on resource \nefficiency and circularity approaches and include the Roadmap \nto a resource efficient Europe (EC, 2011a) and the 2015 circular \n\n(6)\t Perceptions\tand\tdefinitions\tof\t'small'\tabstraction\tdiffer\tamong\tMember\tStates,\te.g.\tin\tFrance:\t1\u00a0000\u00a0m3/year, and in the Netherlands (indicative, \nvaries\tby\twater\tboard)\t100\u00a0m3/h\t(registration\tis\tobligatory\tbut\tno\tpermit\trequired).\n\f\nPolicies on water stress \n\neconomy action plan (EC, 2015b), which was recently updated \n(EC, 2020b) under the European Green Deal (EC, 2019e). \nFurthermore, the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU, 2010) is \nunder review, and a proposal for its revision is expected in late \n2021. It is anticipated that this revision will address resource \nefficiency, including water efficiency. The new industrial strategy \nfor Europe (EC, 2020c) that was published in March 2020 does \nnot include any clear references to water quantity issues. The \nstrategy's review in 2021 is also expected to address the aspect \nof water efficiency in industry.\n\nLastly, the transport sector can also be significantly affected \nby water stress events. The 2018 drought caused restrictions on \ninland navigation in central Europe and disrupted supply chains \nthroughout entire river basins.\n\nThese are just some examples of the main sectoral impacts and \nmeasures that give us insight into the importance of concerted \nand coordinated action beyond sectoral silos.\n\n2.3 Water stress in European climate change, \nnature and biodiversity policy\n\nWorldwide, there is growing awareness of the need for policy \nresponses that address the impacts of climate change on \nwater (Quevauviller and Gemmer, 2015). In Europe, climate \nchange and population growth are shifting conditions, \naffecting a wider geographical spread (see Chapter 3). Member \nStates such as Sweden and Germany suffered large economic \nlosses stemming from droughts in 2018 and 2019, and \nincreased variability in weather patterns is making the existing \nhotspots (e.g. southern Europe) worse off. This is drawing \nrenewed attention to water availability issues at the EU level, \nonce more calling for updates on water scarcity and drought \npolicy and action.\n\nRegarding the consideration of climate change in the second \nRBMPs, significant progress has been achieved compared with \nthe first cycle. Most Member States used the CIS guidance \ndocument (EC, 2009), and climate change was integrated in \na series of actions related to the preparation of the RBMPs. \nHowever, there are still large gaps to address before climate \nchange can be considered fully integrated. In addition, eight \nMember States reported the planning of specific measures to \naddress climate change adaptation. Various Member States \nhave also reported multipurpose measures, which could be \nrelevant in the context of climate change adaptation, although \nthis is not explicitly stated (Buchanan et al., 2019; EC, 2019c).\n\n\u00a9 Juan Manuel Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\nPolicies on water stress \n\n35Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nThe 2013 EU climate change adaptation strategy aimed to \nbuild capacity and increase resilience to extreme weather \nevents, including droughts. It promoted progress in raising \nawareness, developing national adaptation policy and exploring \nadaptation solutions that incorporate natural elements in \nthem, such as green infrastructure and nature-based solutions. \nThe new adaptation strategy from 2021 aims to shift the \nfocus towards action on climate change and to accelerate the \nroll-out of physical solutions, such as creating more green \nspaces. It adopts a systemic perspective to both the impacts \nof and possible solutions to water stress. It appeals directly \nto the WFD and DMPs, advocating nature-based solutions as \nmeans to improve compliance with requirements for good \necological status and potential and as solutions that can 'boost \nthe supply of clean, fresh water' while generating co-benefits \nin a cost-effective way. These commonalities between EU \nadaptation policy, the EU strategy on green infrastructure \nand the biodiversity strategy for 2030 represent another \ninterface between policy areas in which water plays a central \nrole. Here, progress has been made on the study of natural \nwater retention measures that enable the achievement of \nmultiple objectives such as increasing drought resilience and \nwater security, reducing habitat fragmentation, decreasing \nthe emission of greenhouse gases, and providing spaces \nfor recreation. Nevertheless, the primary objectives behind \nthe construction of natural water retention measures so far \nhave been flood risk management, nutrient buffering and \nwastewater treatment, hydromorphological restoration and \nbiodiversity protection (Buchanan et al., 2019). To date, water \nquantity and climate change adaptation objectives seem to \nbe less influential in motivating the application of natural \nwater retention measures. This will change following the shift \nin focus of the new adaptation strategy and the proposed \ndemonstration and scaling up of solutions for transformative \nadaptation under the mission on adaptation of the Horizon \nEurope research programme.\n\n2.4 Policy developments at the global level\n\nTo tackle water stress, the international community has \nrecognised the need for an integrated approach to water, \nenergy, food and ecosystems (Carmona-Moreno et al., \n2019). The approval of the UN 2030 agenda for sustainable \ndevelopment (UN, 2015b) invigorated the discussion on \nsystemic change that has permeated recent EU policy, \nhighlighting the importance of collaboration and policy \nintegration and coherence. The nature of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) is cross-cutting and calls for joint \n\nimplementation. As for their coverage of water stress issues, \nTarget\u00a06.4\thighlights\tthe\tneed\tto\tincrease\twater\tuse\tefficiency\t\nacross all sectors and decouple economic growth from water \nuse,\tand\tTarget\u00a06.5\tpromotes\tintegrated\twater\tmanagement.\t\nKey sectors include agriculture, energy, industry and public \nwater supply. This makes the WEFE (water, energy, food, \necosystem) nexus approach suitable for the pursuit of the \nSDGs. WEFE nexus assessments and projects are gaining \ntraction around the world, and the underlying principles of \nthe approach can also be identified in the most recent EU \npolicy developments. The collective experience gathered \nby these projects could become instrumental in resolving \nthe known issues regarding the differentiation between \nconcepts\t(e.g.\u00a0water\tabstraction\tand\twater\tuse),\tthe\tinclusion\t\nof ecological flows in the development and reporting of the \nindicator group on SDG\u00a06, and the review of water allocation \nand impoundment permits as requested by the EU biodiversity \nstrategy for 2030.\n\nFrom a climate resilience perspective, the previously mentioned \nparadigm shift on vulnerability and risk is largely reflected today \nin the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Since its \npublication in 2015, the global framework has brought about the \ntransition away from crisis management towards risk planning \nthat had already been under way in European countries such \nas Spain since the 1990s. It has also been effective in creating a \nframework for international coordination on the management \nof hydrometeorological risks such as droughts. The Sendai \nFramework will remain in force until 2030, which, in the context \nof the current climate crisis, raises citizens' awareness but also \nemboldens Member States to implement measures to increase \nwater supply. It will also be an important lever for maintaining \nthe emphasis on addressing unsustainable water management \nand exploitation practices. A similar boost is expected from \nthe sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC), which is due in 2022.\n\f\n\u00a9 Ihsan Ilze, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\n37Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\n3 \nImpacts of climate change on \n\nwater availability in Europe\n\n3.1 Key meteorological impacts of \nclimate\u00a0change\n\n3.1.1 Temperature\n\nPast trends in temperature\n\nThe mean average annual global near-surface temperature \nhas been increasing since the mid-19th century.

Heavy precipitation in \nsummer will remain similar or slightly increase in most \nparts of Europe. The exceptions are many coastal areas \nof southern European countries, as well as the Pyrenees \nand part of the Alps, where significant decreases are \nexpected. The projected decrease in cyclone frequency in \nthe Mediterranean contributes in part to the phenomena \ndescribed above (EEA, 2019b).\n\n3.1.3 Glaciers and snow\n\nSnow accumulates over the colder period of the year and \nmelts slowly in spring. Melted snow and glaciers discharge \ninto groundwater, streams and rivers with a lag time of many \n\nmonths after the initial snowfall. The snow cover thus \nsignificantly affects the timing of hydrological processes in \nriver basins, generally in central and northern Europe and \nin mountain areas across the continent.\n\nPast trends in snow cover\n\nThe extent of the snow cover has decreased significantly \nin the northern hemisphere as a whole in the past \n90\u00a0years,\twith\tthe\tgreatest\tpart\tof\tthis\tdecline\toccurring\t\nsince the 1980s.

Large European rivers, such as the Danube, the \nRhine and the Po, spring from the Alps. Thus, their flow \nregimes are affected by the changing patterns of snow fall and \naccumulations and melting of glaciers.\n\nFuture projections for snow cover\n\nFuture climate projections (under high-emission RCP \nscenario\u00a08.5)\tindicate\tthat\tthe\tduration\tof\tthe\tsnow\tseason\tin\t\nthe northern hemisphere could decline further up to 40 days, \nthe\tMarch/April\tsnow\tcover\tcould\tbe\treduced\tby\tup\tto\t25\u00a0%,\t\nand\tthe\tsnow\tmass\tcould\tdecrease\tby\tup\tto\t30\u00a0%\t(EEA,\t2016f).\n\n3.1.4 Evapotranspiration\n\nPast trends in evapotranspiration\n\nEvapotranspiration is closely related to the type of land cover \nand climate conditions (e.g. temperature, wind, humidity, solar \nradiation) over a specified area. The analysis of the underlying \nthe ENSEMBLES daily gridded observational dataset  used for \nthe European water accounts (Zal et al., 2017; EEA, 2018b, \n2019l) shows that evapotranspiration increased across all \nregions of Europe for the period 1990-2017. Proportionately, \n\nthe most significant increases were observed in northern, \neastern\tand\twestern\tEurope\t(between\t9\u00a0%\tand\t27%),\twhereas\t\nthe\tincrease\twas\tlower\t(4\u00a0%)\tin\talready\twater-stressed\t\nsouthern Europe. These trends show that transpiration from \nvegetation and evaporation from soil and water surfaces in \nEurope has increased significantly in recent decades. The \nincrease in evapotranspiration is mainly attributed to the \nincrease in the transpiration from vegetation, which can be \nfurther linked with the expansion of agricultural land since \nthe 1980s and the observed increase in the land temperature \nacross Europe (Zhang et al., 2016).\n\nFuture projections for evapotranspiration\n\nDriven by the projected increase in temperature, \nevapotranspiration in Europe will increase further in the future \n(Map 3.4). However, the potential increase could be partly \noffset by reduced transpiration from vegetation due to higher \natmospheric concentrations of CO2 (EEA, 2016b). Increased \nevapotranspiration is expected across most of Europe and across \nall seasons. The largest increases could be expected especially in \nwinter and autumn. Compared with spring and summer, water \navailability is higher in autumn and winter, so the increase in \ntemperature could cause more water to evaporate from open \nwater surfaces and transpire from vegetation. Furthermore, \na small decrease in evapotranspiration could be expected in \ncentral-northern Europe in spring.\n\f\nImpacts of climate change on water availability in Europe \n\n43Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nBox 3.1 Glaciers and snow cover have been shrinking in the Alps since the 19th century\n\nThe\tAlpine\tregion,\twhich\tcovers\tapproximately\t190\u00a0700\u00a0km2, extends over eight European countries (Austria, France, \nGermany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, Switzerland), hosting more than 14 million people.

Furthermore, Swiss scientists and authorities have observed that the cumulative mass of eight Alpine glaciers shows \na decreasing trend which has been accelerated in recent decades (Figure 3.2, right). This is related to the increase in the \ntemperature, which causes larger and earlier melting within the year. And it is also related to the change in the precipitation \npatterns, which results in an increase in the share of the precipitation falling as rain rather than snow.

For example, higher rainfall in winters causes higher winter \ndischarges, increasing the risk of floods. Furthermore, the lower extent and mass of glaciers and accumulated snow \ndecrease the storage of equivalent water, which could melt and recharge rivers, especially during the spring months. Higher \ntemperatures are also causing higher evapotranspiration. Thus, summer discharges tend to become lower on average. As \ndrought events are also occurring more frequently, especially in the southern and south-eastern Alps, it is expected that \nclimate change will further decrease the observed low river discharges annually. River flow observations in the Swiss part \nof the Rh\u00f4ne (Porte-du-Scex) since the start of the 20th century show an amplification of seasonal patterns with increased \ndischarges in winter and decreased discharges in summer.\n\nThe\tAlpine\tlandscape\tis\thome\tto\ta\tvery\tdiverse\tecosystem,\twhere\t30\u00a0000\tanimal\tspecies\tand\t13\u00a0000\tplant\tspecies\tcan\tbe\t\nfound.

However, the role of climate change \nis mostly supplementary, compared with the role of water \nmanagement practices. Overabstraction of groundwater by \nagriculture and other water-dependent sectors was found to \nbe the key pressure leading to aquifer depletion in the above \ncases. Climate change was identified as a more prominent \n\nfactor for groundwater depletion in the case of the Rh\u00f4ne river \nbasin, as well as in Iceland.\n\nThe higher storage capacity of aquifers, and their lower \nvulnerability to evaporation and better protection from \npollution, are key features that distinguish them from surface \nwaters. In principle, groundwater flows more quickly through \nporous aquifers made up of loosely consolidated sands, silts \nand gravels, highly productive fissured aquifers and karstic \nformations, and significantly fractured aquifers. Therefore, \nwhen recharge decreases, the risk of rapid groundwater \ndepletion is also higher for these types of aquifers. However, \nthe risk of depletion is also affected by factors such as the \nsize of the aquifers, local topography and hydrogeology. \nFor instance, a shallow unconfined aquifer of little thickness \nwithin a river flood plain is more likely to be rapidly affected by \ndecreases in the average river discharge than a deep, confined \nand thick aquifer that is fed from highly productive karstic \nsystems (Psomas et al., 2021).\n\f\nImpacts of climate change on water availability in Europe \n\n49Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nFuture projections for groundwater recharge\n\nIn those areas where climate change is projected to cause \nlower precipitation and increased temperatures and \nevapotranspiration (see previous sections), it is expected \nthat groundwater recharge will generally decrease (Box 3.2). \nTherefore, decreases in groundwater recharge are expected in \nsouthern and western Europe, whereas increases are expected \nin parts of central, eastern and north-eastern Europe (Map 3.8) \n(Feyen et al., 2020).\n\nEarlier snow melting is expected to cause a shift in groundwater \nrecharge with melted snow from spring to winter. Thus, the \n\nMap\t3.8\t Projected\tpercentage\tchange\tin\tannual\tgroundwater\trecharge\tfor\ta\t3\u00a0\u00b0C\ttemperature\tscenario\n\nNote: Results provided at Ecrins sub-basin level (EEA, 2012a).\n\nSource: Underlying\tdata\tobtained\tfrom\tthe\tJRC\tPeseta\u00a0IV\treport\t(Feyen\tet\tal.,\t2020).\n\npeak time of baseflow to surface waters could also occur earlier. \nHence, low summer flows that are particularly sustained by \nbaseflow could be seriously affected (Kl\u00f8ve et al., 2014).\n\nFurthermore, climate change is expected to cause a rise in the \naverage sea level and increase storm surges. Coastal aquifers, \nespecially those that are being exploited intensively, may be \nsignificantly affected by the intrusion of water from the sea \ninto groundwater. Salinisation can make the groundwater \nunsuitable for use and affect dependent ecosystems.\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n0 500 1 000 1 500 km\n\n70\u00b00\u00b060\u00b0\n\n555\n\nPercentage \n\nProjected percentage change in\nannual groundwater recharge \nfor a 3 \u00b0C temperature scenario\n\n\u2264 -20\n\n-20 to -10\n\n-10 to 0\n\n0 to 10\n\n10 to 20\n\nSubbasin (as delineated \nin Ecrins)\n\n> 30\n\n20 to 30\n\nOutside coverage\n\nNo data\n\f\nImpacts of climate change on water availability in Europe \n\nBox 3.2 Climate change will lower groundwater   \n                   levels in the Loire and south-western   \n France\n\nThe Explore 2070 project has developed and assessed \nstrategies to adapt to climate change impacts on \nhydrological systems and coastal environments in \nmainland and overseas France up to 2070, based on \nvarious climatic, demographic and socio-economic \nscenarios. Rises in temperature (and consequently \nevapotranspiration) combined with decreasing rainfall \nwill lead to a decrease in effective precipitation in the \nfuture. The application of seven climate models using \nthe median greenhouse gas emission scenario (A1B, \nfourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nreport) enabled an estimate of the change in natural \nrecharge rates.

The trend is most pronounced in areas of Spain, Portugal, \nItaly, Greece, Turkey and France (Map 3.9) (EEA, 2016e).\n\nAfter a decade of very warm and dry years, 2019 was also a \nparticularly dry year.

However, in November and December a rapid \nturnaround to high river discharges occurred in western \nEurope, causing a large number of flood events (ECMWF, 2020).\n\nFuture projections for river discharges\n\nClimate change is shifting the seasonal patterns of river \ndischarges across Europe and increasing the occurrence of \nseasonal extremes (Figure 3.4). Future summer discharges \nare projected to further decrease in southern Europe and \nparts of western and northern Europe, whereas an increase is \nexpected in parts of eastern and north-eastern Europe during \nall seasons (Map 3.10) (Feyen et al., 2020).

Further urbanisation and an associated increase in water demand and soil sealing is expected, most strongly in existing major \nurban centres.\n\n\u2022 Agriculture remains the major water consumer in Europe, because of high water consumption in irrigated agriculture in the south, \nbut the sector shows signs of decoupling water consumption from growth in southern, western and northern Europe.\n\n\u2022 The installation of renewable energy generation schemes has contributed to significant reductions in water consumption in the \nenergy sector, because they have replaced combustion plants, which require water for cooling. Western Europe shows significant \ntrends towards decoupling water consumption from growth in the energy sector.\n\n\u2022 Water consumption in the industrial sector is decreasing, while the value of industrial production continues to grow in western, \nnorthern and eastern Europe, suggesting a trend towards absolute decoupling.\n\n\u2022 The public water supply sector has achieved significant water savings overall in Europe. However, the volume of public water \nsupply increased in southern countries, and tourism has posed significant local pressures, especially in the Mediterranean.\n\n\u2022 A comprehensive update of a 2007 study on potential water savings in the EU's economic sectors (Dworak et al., 2007) is urgently \nneeded to estimate the remaining potential and help identify realistic goals for saving water.\n\n4.1 Freshwater use in Europe\n\nAlmost\t250\u00a0000\tmillion\u00a0m3 of water were abstracted in Europe \n(EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-38) and the \nUK) in 2017 to serve the needs of the various sectors of the \nEuropean\teconomy.\tThis\tcorresponds\tto\tnearly\t9\u00a0%\tof\tthe\t\nannual renewable freshwater resources in Europe.

Similarly, because of trade, the use \nof water in the production of commodities does not necessarily \noccur where the commodities are consumed. In a globalised \nenvironment the linkages between local water, food and \nmaterial demand, local water use and local water stress can be \nvery complex. Therefore, the water stress problems observed \nin a given region in Europe can be caused by indirect water \nconsumption elsewhere. Similarly, the water stress problems \nin areas of other continents can be related to consumption \npatterns in Europe.\n\nChanges in food consumption patterns in Europe\n\nThe\taverage\twater\tfootprint\u00a0(7) of food consumption (dietary \npatterns)\tin\tthe\tEU\tis\testimated\tat\t5\u00a0730\tlitres/capita\tper\tday\t\n(Vanham et al., 2013).\n\nOverall, the average consumption of meat, dairy and cereal \nproducts per person is increasing in the EU (Figure 4.5), \nwhile Europe is one of the top consumers of these products \nin the world (EC, 2019f). Meat and dairy products require \nproportionately more water than most crops for their \nproduction (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2012, 2011), which means \nthat the average diet of European citizens is becoming more \nwater intensive.\n\nFurthermore, not all food produced actually reaches \nconsumers' plates. Food waste throughout the whole food \nchain is a major concern, as it is also linked to a considerable \nwaste of water, soil and energy resources, which are used to \nproduce the wasted food. Currently, the average food waste in \nthe\tEU\tamounts\tto\t173\u00a0kg/capita\tper\tyear,\twith\t30\u00a0%\toccurring\t\nduring\tproduction\tand\tprocessing\tand\t70\u00a0%\toccurring\tin\tfood\t\nretail, food services or households (Stenmarck et al., 2016).\n\nA European Commission outlook study suggests that the \nconsumption of cereals and dairy products will increase until \n2030, whereas meat consumption is likely to stabilise or reduce, \npartly because of a projected shift towards a more plant-based \ndiet for the average European citizen (EC, 2019f).\n\nBox 4.1  Population growth and climate change \ncausing water demand to offset increases \nin water supply in Istanbul\n\nIstanbul is the largest urban agglomeration of the EEA \nmember and cooperating countries, and it is classified \nas\ta\tmegacity\t(i.e.\ta\tcity\twith\ta\tpopulation\tover\t10\u00a0million\t\npeople).\tIstanbul\thas\ta\tpopulation\tof\tmore\tthan\t15\u00a0million\t\ninhabitants,\tand\tits\ttotal\tpopulation\tincreased\tby\t36\u00a0%\t\nover\tthe\tlast\tdecade\t(1.7\u00a0%\tannual\taverage\u00a0growth).\n\nAlthough not a 'naturally dry' area, water scarcity is \na local issue because of the concentrated population \nand its increase over time. Despite enormous efforts to \nincrease the water supply, projected future urbanisation \nand population growth, together with climate change, \nwill further increase water demand (Figure 4.4).\n\nFigure\t4.4\t\tWater\tsupply\tand\tdemand\tin\tIstanbul,\u00a0 \n1990-204\n\nWater supply Water demand\n\n0\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n900\n\n1 100\n\n1 300\n\n1 200\n\n1 000\n\n800\n\n1 400\n\n1 500\n\nMillion m3/year\n\n20401990 2000 2010 2020 2030\n\n590\n\n860\n\n945\n\n1 025\n\n1 170\n\n1 360\n\nSource: Altinbilek (2006).\n\nSources: Altinbilek (2006); van Leeuwen and Sjerps (2016).\n\nBox 4.2 Population growth as a prominent driver \nof urban sprawl and regionally high water \nconsumption in Stockholm\n\nThe\tmetropolitan\tregion\tof\tStockholm\tsaw\ta\t30\u00a0%\t\npopulation\tincrease\tbetween\t2000\tand\t2019\t(+1.4\u00a0%\t\nper\tyear\ton\taverage),\twith\tan\tincrease\tof\tover\t500\u00a0000\t\ninhabitants during the last 20 years.

In areas with \nmore temperate climates, agriculture is mostly rain fed, but \nirrigation is also applied to regulate seasonal water deficits \nand ensure satisfactory quality and yields of products. Soil \nconditions can be a critical factor in this case. For example, in \nDenmark irrigation is mainly needed for farming on sandy soils \nwith low water retention capacity, whereas nearly no irrigation \ntakes\tplace\tin\tother\tparts\tof\tthe\tcountry\twith\tclay\tsoils\u00a0(9). \nIn drier climates, however, rain can provide only part of the \ncrop's water requirements. Thus, additional water needs to be \nprovided to enable crop production. Water is also needed for \nraising animals to meet their direct needs for consumption and \nthe requirements for growing their food and cleaning livestock \nfacilities. Aquaculture and forestry are also dependent on \nwater availability, although they are not directly dependent on \nwater\u00a0abstraction.\n\nWater abstraction in Europe for agriculture is very unevenly \ndistributed:\talmost\t90\u00a0%\toccurs\tin\tsouthern\tEurope\tand\t\nonly\t10\u00a0%\tin\tthe\tother\tparts\tof\tthe\tcontinent.\tThe\tarea\tof\t\narable\tland\tin\tEurope\tis\taround\t113\u00a0million\u00a0ha,\tand\tnearly\t\n\n(9) Information provided by the Danish representative (Ingelise M\u00f8ller Balling) during consultation about the report with the Eionet group.\n\n19\u00a0million\u00a0ha\tis\tequipped\tfor\tirrigation\t(irrigable\tarea).\t\nDepending on the climatic conditions, the actually irrigated \narea\tis\tapproximately\t8-9\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\tarable\tland.\tThe\t\nshares of irrigated land are much higher in southern Europe, \nranging\tfrom\t28\u00a0%\tin\tMalta\tto\t13\u00a0%\tin\tSpain\tand\tPortugal.\t\nAgriculture\taccounts\tfor\t40-60\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\twater\tconsumption\t\nin Europe, most of it used for irrigation. Water consumption \nby agriculture shows the highest fluctuation throughout \nthe year, as the demand for irrigation water rises sharply \nduring spring and summer, especially in southern Europe. \nIn southern Member States, agricultural water abstraction \naccounts\tfor\tapproximately\t80\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\twater\tabstraction\t\n(EEA,\t2018b,\u00a02019k).\n\nThe water footprint of different crop and meat products \ndiffers considerably (Figure 4.7). The highest water footprint \nis observed for vegetable oils, fibre crops and fruits among \ncrop products and for beef and sheep and goat meat among \nmeat products. Crop and meat products that are produced \nin Europe are estimated to have a lower water footprint than \nsimilar products imported into Europe from foreign countries, \nbecause of the different climatic conditions, water management \npractices and environmental policy frameworks.\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n65Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nIn general, the cropping patterns in southern Europe include \nmany crops with high water requirements (e.g. cotton, \nlucerne, maize, fruit trees, vegetables) (Eurostat, 2019a; \nEEA, 2019k), which are cultivated there for various reasons, \nincluding favourable climatic and soil conditions, long-standing \ntradition and know-how (e.g. special equipment and trained \nprofessionals) and current levels of revenues (especially from \n\nfairly commercial/tradeable crops). Because of the low water \navailability and semi-arid conditions in many parts of southern \nEurope, the water demand of these crops is largely provided \nby irrigation. The irrigation abstraction per hectare exceeds \n5\u00a0000\u00a0m3 in most southern European countries, as well as in \nBulgaria.\tValues\thigher\tthan\t1\u00a0000\u00a0m3 are also observed in \ncountries such as Romania and France (Figure 4.8).\n\nFigure 4.7 Water footprints of crop and meat commodities in the EU and in non-EU countries exporting to the \nEU (litres/kg of product)\n\nNote: Green EU and Green non-EU is water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated, transpired or \nincorporated by plants; in crop and meat production inside and outside the EU, respectively.\n\nBlue EU and Blue non-EU is water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated, incorporated \ninto\ta\tproduct\tor\ttaken\tfrom\tone\tbody\tof\twater\tand\treturned\tto\tanother,\tor\treturned\tat\ta\tdifferent\ttime;\tin\tcrop\tand\tmeat\tproduction\t\ninside and outside the EU, respectively.\n\nSource: EC (2019f).\n\n12 00010 0008 0006 0004 0002 0000\n\nLitres/kilogram\n\nBeef\n\nVegetable oils\n\nFibre crops\n\nSheep and goat meat\n\nOther fruits\n\nRapeseed\n\nOther cereals\n\nPoultry meat\n\nSoya beans\n\nWheat\n\nSoya meal\n\nGrain maize\n\nCitrus\n\nGreen EU Blue non-EUBlue EUGreen non-EU\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n66 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s the World Trade Organization \nundertook significant reforms, which liberalised global trade. \nStimulated global trade within a globalised economy has \nprovided new opportunities and new markets for European \nagricultural products. However, after the 2003 common \nagricultural policy (CAP) reform, and more recently of the \n2013 CAP reform, has resulted in a decoupling of direct \npayments from agricultural production and raised sustainable \nwater management as a key objective of rural development \npolicy. This has contributed to a slowdown or reversal in the \nexpansion of irrigated areas, as well as the modernisation of \nirrigation infrastructures to achieve more efficient water use, \nfor instance in France (Rouillard, 2020).\n\nBetween\t2002\tand\t2017\tthe\tirrigated\tarea\tshrunk\tby\t6\u00a0%,\t\nalthough\tthe\ttotal\tutilised\tagricultural\tarea\texpanded\tby\t4\u00a0%\t\n\nFigure 4.8 Irrigation abstraction per hectare of irrigated arable land in Europe, 2016\n\n9 0008 0007 0006 0005 0004 0003 0002 0001 0000\n\nDenmark (2019)\nLithuania\n\nEstonia\n\nGreece\nCyprus\n\nPortugal (2013)\nMalta\nSpain\n\nItaly (2013)\nSlovenia\n\nCroatia (2010)\nBulgaria\n\nRomania\nHungary\nCzechia\nPoland\n\nSlovakia\nFrance\n\nAustria (2010)\nGermany\n\nNetherlands\nSweden (2010)\n\nLatvia\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFinland (2010)Northern Europe\n\nWestern Europe\n\nEastern Europe\n\nSouthern Europe\n\nEuropean average\n\nNorthern Europe averageWestern Europe average\n\nEastern Europe averageSouthern Europe average\n\nM3/hectare/year\n\nNote: Country grouping is adapted from UN Geo schema M49 (UNSD, 1999).\n\nSource: EEA (2019k, 2019l); Statistics Denmark (2021).\n\nin Europe.

Moreover, warmer climatic conditions \nearlier in spring and later in autumn may enable crop cultivation \nfor longer periods of time and possibly multiple harvests.

An overall increase \nis projected across all of Europe (EEA, 2016b). Regarding future \ncrop yields, the projections show high variability depending \non location, crop type, climate and management conditions. \nOverall, an increase in productivity is expected in northern \nEurope and a decrease in southern Europe, although this is not \nuniform across all crop types (EEA, 2016h).\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n69Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nThe potential water saving from individual technical measures \nfor irrigated agriculture differs considerably, and it relies \nupon site-specific conditions (e.g. soils, crop types) and the \ntechnology applied. An indication of potential water savings is \nprovided in Table 4.2. It has been estimated that the potential \nwater\tsavings\tin\tirrigated\tagriculture\tcould\texceed\t40\u00a0%\tof\tthe\t\ntotal abstraction if combinations of the above measures were \napplied (Dworak et al., 2007).\n\nAs part of the Blue2 project, several scenarios were developed \nfor potential water-saving measures for irrigated areas in \nsouthern European countries (Benitez Sanz et al., 2018). The \nmain\toutcomes\twere\tthat\tup\tto\t5\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tannual\trenewable\t\nfreshwater resources in each river basin could be saved, if all \nplanned irrigation efficiency measures from the river basin \n\nmanagement plans (RBMPs) were implemented. In comparison, \n10\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tannual\trenewable\tfreshwater\tresources\tcould\tbe\t\nsaved if all feasible technical measures were implemented, \nregardless of their total cost (e.g. upgrading conveyance \nsystems to reduce leakage, seepage and evapotranspiration \nlosses; applying the most efficient irrigation technology on a \ncase-by-case basis). Although these gains are considerable, \ntaking into account the significant levels of water stress in many \nsouthern\triver\tbasins\t(often\texceeding\t30\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tannual\t\nrenewable freshwater resources), they are not sufficient on \ntheir own to reverse water scarcity conditions. In addition, \nto capitalise on the aforementioned potential water savings, \nwhich can be achieved by improving irrigation systems and \nequipment, both investments and supporting actions are \nrequired (e.g. adjusting end users' management practices).\n\n\u00a9 Deltares\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n70 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nTable 4.2 Potential water savings from applying indicative technical measures in the agricultural sector \n\nMeasure Potential water saving (%)\n\nUpgrading conveyance infrastructure (e.g. closed pipes replacing open trenches) 10-25\n\nChanging to use irrigation methods with higher application efficiency (e.g. drip micro-irrigation \nreplacing furrow irrigation)\n\n15-60\n\nChanging irrigation practices (e.g. rescheduling irrigation, mulching) 30\n\nCrop restructuring (e.g. drought-resistant crops replacing water-demanding and drought-sensitive \ncrops)\n\n50\n\nIrrigating with reclaimed water 10\n\nSource: Dworak et al.

Water abstracted for electricity production is \nconsumed to varying degrees (see sub-sections below and \nFigure 4.10), and the rest is discharged to surface waters. In \n\ngeneral, water consumption for electricity production is much \nlower than that for other sectors (e.g. irrigated agriculture). \nAlthough the total freshwater abstracted for primary energy \nproduction\t(e.g.\u00a0oil\u00a0and\tgas\textraction,\tcoal\tmining,\tand\tbiomass\t\nproduction), as well as for oil refineries, is very low compared \nwith that abstracted for electricity production (less than 10\u00a0%),\t\nwe should be cautious about coming to rapid conclusions. \nFor each of these activities, the water consumption per unit of \nenergy generated is far from negligible (see Figure 4.11) (Jin et \nal., 2019; Magagna et al., 2019; Hidalgo Gonzalez et al., 2020).\n\n\u00a9 Lukas Grycicha, Water PIX, EEA\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n71Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nFrom this point onwards, this section focuses on activities for \nelectricity production, which represents the largest share of \nfreshwater abstraction in the energy sector.\n\nCombustion plants and nuclear stations abstract water to \ncool the hot steam that is created by burning fuel and is used \nto rotate turbines. Electricity generated from combustion plants \n\ncovers\taround\t60\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\telectricity\tconsumed\tin\tEurope.\t\nThe discharge of cooling water to the receiving water bodies \ncauses thermal pollution, resulting in the risk of fish populations \nsuffering from hypoxia. Cooling water for electricity production \nwas\tresponsible\tfor\tnearly\t18\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\twater\tconsumption\tin\t\nEurope in 2017. The use of cooling water is relatively high in \nwestern and eastern Europe. France and Germany have the \nhighest consumption of cooling water; together they make up \n45\u00a0%\tof\tEurope's\ttotal\tconsumption\t(EEA,\t2018b).\n\nHydropower plants using freshwater are usually installed in \nrunning water ('run-of-river installations') or at river dams ('dam \ninstallations').\tHydropower\tplants\tprovide\tapproximately\t12\u00a0%\t\nof\tthe\ttotal\tenergy\tproduction\t(average\t2015-2019)\u00a0(10). As river \nor reservoir water flows through the hydropower installation, \na series of turbines rotate and generate electricity. Virtually all \nof the water used in hydropower plants is directly returned to \nthe water bodies. Therefore, the amount of water consumed \nby hydropower plants during their operation is considered \n\nnegligible. However, this actually depends on the site and the \nconfiguration of the technology, and there is no overall estimate \nfor its range (IEA and OECD, 2010). Throughout the life cycle \nof a dam installation, part of the reservoir water evaporates. \nThus, hydropower installations are partly accountable for the \nconsumption of reservoir water through evaporation.\n\nHydropower installations can have significant \nhydromorphological impacts, as they impede the natural water \nand nutrient cycles, and they create obstacles for the transport \nof freshwater biodiversity, sediments and substances.\n\nThe generation of hydropower from large and small dams \nincreased substantially during the last century, but that growth \nhas slowed in recent decades, because the most productive \nlocations are already occupied and because environmental \npermitting in Europe has become more comprehensive, \nfollowing the adoption of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) \n(permitting\tprocedure\tunder\tArt.\u00a04.7).\tHowever,\thydropower\t\ninstallations have multiplied in areas such as the Western \nBalkans. More than half of the electricity produced in Albania, \nAustria, Croatia, Iceland, Luxembourg and Montenegro \ncomes from hydropower (EEA, 2018b).

The above sub-sectors need water for \ncooling purposes, processing activities, washing and cleaning \nof facilities and equipment, and for integration into products. \nThe returned cooling water can cause problems with thermal \npollution and hypoxia. Furthermore, industrial discharges can \nbe highly contaminated and then require appropriate treatment \nbefore discharge. In the case of washing and cleaning, water \nconsumption is considered low to negligible, but discharged \nwater may need treatment because of its nutrient and organic \ncontents (EEA, 2018b).\n\nMining and quarrying include a diversity of activities, such \nas mineral extraction (e.g. coal, ores, petroleum, gas) and \npreparatory actions for the supply of materials to markets \n(e.g. crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating \nores, liquefaction of natural gas, agglomeration of solid fuels). \nGroundwater is pumped out to drain mining and quarrying \nsites, which, among other impacts, can affect groundwater flow \nregimes (Box 4.3). When mining activities cease, the dewatering \n\noperations are gradually phased out, resulting in a rebound \nto normal groundwater levels. As groundwater flows through \nthe fractured rocks, acidification may take place. Acid drainage, \npooling in underground galleys or flowing out from surface \nopenings can degrade the quality of local surface water and \ngroundwater. Furthermore, water is abstracted and used for \nprocessing activities, such as rock crushing and dust control. \nThe retention ponds for residual mine slurries and the leachate \nfrom precipitation falling on unprotected heaps of mine waste \ncan be additional sources of pollution if poorly managed. In \n2017, the share of water abstracted for mining was the highest \nin\twestern\t(40\u00a0%)\tand\tsouthern\t(22\u00a0%)\tEurope\t((EEA,\t2018b;\t\nTayebi-Khorami et al., 2019).\n\nWater consumption by manufacturing industry and \nmining and quarrying is generally decreasing with the \nexception of many Western Balkan and eastern European \ncountries\t(Figure\u00a04.14).\tThis\ttrend\tcan\tbe\tattributed\tto\t\nthe modernisation of production processes, technological \nimprovements, more efficient methods, and water recycling \nand reuse. Furthermore, water consumption by the industrial \nand mining sector has also declined, because of the deindustrialisation of specific regions in Europe since industrial \nproduction has been partly transferred abroad.

Similar concerns had been expressed earlier by the neighbouring German city of \nZittau, and several non-governmental organisations had sent a joint letter of complaint to the European Commission. \nThe European Court of Justice issued a temporary judgment in May 2021, saying that the Polish authorities had granted \na renewed licence for the Tur\u00f3w mining activities without first evaluating the environmental impacts and engaging in \ndialogue with the stakeholder. It also ordered that all operations cease until a final judgment is given.\n\nSource: AP (2021).\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n76 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nFigure 4.14 Development of water consumption by industry and mining in Europe (EEA-38 and the UK), \n2010-2017\n\nComparing the total water consumed in the industrial sector \nwith the NVA generated in the economy from that sector shows \nthat trends towards absolute decoupling of economic growth \nfrom water consumption are already visible in all countries, \nalthough the pace of decoupling differs between the regions \n(Figure 4.15).\n\nBulgaria\n\nCzechia\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\nEastern Europe\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nIreland\n\nIceland\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nNorway\n\nSweden\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nN/A\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\nNorthern Europe\n\nAlbania\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nCyprus\n\nGreece\n\nSpain\n\nCroatia\n\nItaly\n\nMontenegro\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nMalta\n\nPortugal\n\nSerbia\n\nSlovenia\n\nTurkey\n\nKosovo*\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\nSouthern Europe\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nSwitzerland\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLuxembourg\n\nNetherlands\n\nN/A\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\nWestern Europe\n\nMining, quarrying, manufacturing and construction\n\nDecrease in water consumptionIncrease in water consumption \u2191 \u2193 N/A - Not applicable\n\nNotes: Country grouping is adapted from UN Geo schema M49 (UNSD, 1999).\n\nSources: EEA (2019l, 2021d); Eurostat (2020f).\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n77Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nFigure 4.15 Comparison of regional trends in water consumption and economic growth in the industrial sector \nin Europe (EEA-38 and the UK), 1995-2017\n\nNotes: Light\tblue\tline\tindicates\twater\tconsumed\tby\tthe\tindustrial\tsector\t(indexed\t1995\u00a0=\u00a0100);\tdark\tblue\tline\tindicates\tnet\tvalue\tadded\t\n(indexed\u00a01995\u00a0=\u00a0100).\t\n\nCountry grouping is adapted from UN Geo schema M49 (UNSD, 1999).

The public water supply \nindustry consists of utilities that abstract water from surface \nwater and groundwater, treat it to remove hazardous \nsubstances and pathogens, and supply the treated water to \nend\u00a0users.\n\nIn\t2017,\thouseholds\taccounted\tfor\tover\t60\u00a0%\tof\tthe\ttotal\t\npublic\twater\tsupply\tin\tEurope.\tIn\t2017,\taround\t50\u00a0%\tof\t\n\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n78 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\npublic water supply was accounted for by southern Europe, \nwhich is associated with the impact of tourism in this region \n(EEA,\u00a02018b).\n\nPublic water supply often faces water quality issues in the \nwater source, such as salinisation in coastal areas, as well as \nproblems with nitrates, sulphates, heavy metals, pesticides, \npharmaceuticals, and other contaminants. The WFD requires \nthat all Member States establish safeguarded zones to protect \ndrinking water. In addition, the (revised) Drinking Water \nDirective\tof\t16\u00a0December\t2020\tregulates\tthe\tquality\tof\twater\t\nintended for human consumption, including the accompanying \nquality standards for the water supplied, to ensure that the \nrisks to human health are mitigated (EU, 2020a).\n\nIn 2017, the average water consumption of households in \nEurope\twas\testimated\tat\t147\tlitres/day\tper\tperson\u00a0(11). The daily \nminimum required to meet basic human needs is estimated at \n50 litres/day per person (Gleick, 1996), so the European average \nis comfortably above that threshold. Nevertheless, the average \nwater supply to European households varies substantially on \na national level, for example from 115 litres/day per person \nin Belgium to 265 litres/day per person in Spain (12).

Thus, leaks result in financial losses \nfor water suppliers and they may affect the affordability of \nwater services as a result of higher bills. In major European \ncities, such as Athens, Istanbul, Madrid or Paris, drinking water \nmay come from very distant sources, which sometimes lie \n100-200\u00a0km\tfrom\tthe\tcity\t(EEA,\t2018c).\tThe\tlength,\tthe\toperation\t\nand the maintenance of the pipes affects the level of leakages. \nAccording\tto\tEurEau\u00a0(13) estimates (EurEau, 2017), the average \nleakage rate of the drinking water distribution networks \nacross\tEurope\tis\tapproximately\t23\u00a0%\tof\tall\twater\tdistributed.\t\nA review of case studies across Europe (ERM, 2013) indicated \nthat the losses from drinking water distribution networks \nrange\tbetween\t10\u00a0%\tand\t72\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tabstracted\tvolumes.\t\nThe revised Drinking Water Directive requires EU Member \nStates to assess the level of infrastructural leakages and the \npotential for improvement, applying to at least water suppliers \nsupplying\tmore\tthan\t10\u00a0000\u00a0m3 per day or serving more than \n\n50\u00a0000\tpeople.\tThe\tCommission\thas\tbeen\tdelegated\tto\tdefine\t\na threshold for water leakages, and countries exceeding that \nthreshold will be required to present an action plan to address \nthe issue (EU, 2020a).\n\nThanks to a combination of increased pricing, water-saving \ntechnologies and measures, and awareness campaigns, Europe \nsaw significant reductions in the public water supply demand \nfor\thouseholds\tbetween\t1990\tand\t2017\t(-16\u00a0%),\tdespite\t\na parallel increase in the European population. However, \nsouthern Europe did not follow this trend, as public water \nsupply\tfor\thouseholds\tincreased\tby\t10\u00a0%\tover\tthe\tsame\tperiod\t\n(EEA, 2018b).\n\n4.6.1 Future outlook\n\nDworak et al. (2007) estimated that a reduction in domestic \nwater\tuse\tof\t50\u00a0%\tor\teven\tmore\twas\tfeasible.\tBenito\tet\tal.\t\n(2009) estimated the potential water savings in households \nat\t32\u00a0%,\tby\tusing\tmore\twater-efficient\thousehold\tappliances,\t\nand\tat\t20\u00a0%,\tby\tusing\tmore\twater-efficient\ttoilets\tand\t\nshowers\u00a0alone.\n\nIncreasing population and changes in household types \n(i.e.\u00a0more\tsingle\thouseholds,\twhich\ton\taverage\tconsume\tmore\t\nwater per capita) are expected to increase the demand for \npublic water supply.\n\nThe role of household income is ambiguous. On the one hand, \nhigher incomes have traditionally led to the adoption of better \nliving standards and has been considered a factor in increasing \nwater use per individual. On the other hand, nowadays, higher \nhousehold incomes can result in more rapid access to novel and \nmore water- and energy-efficient household appliances, better \nmaintenance and timely replacement. Thus, income could also \nbe a factor contributing to lower water use in households.\n\n4.7 Water use by tourism and recreation\n\nTourism and recreation is a special sub-sector, which is supplied \nwith water from the public water supply. It includes various \ntypes of water use, such as water for hotel and accommodation \nservices, food and restaurant services, spas, saunas and \nswimming pools, golf courses, parks and urban green \nspaces, and outdoor sports and leisure activities in natural \nlandscapes. Water quality can be an important concern for this \nsub-sector because the water supplied needs to meet different \ntypes of criteria, for example fit for human consumption \n\n(11) Calculated as the ratio of the total volume of household water consumed and the total population in the EEA-38 and the UK.\n(12) According to the estimation of the Spanish Directorate of Water, water consumption is 133 litres/day per person in Spain.\n(13) EurEau is the European Federation of National Associations of Water Services (https://www.eureau.org).\n\nhttps://www.eureau.org/\f\nFreshwater use in Europe under socio-economic change\n\n79Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nand skin contact, suitable for bathing, as well as aesthetic \ncriteria ('landscape beauty). For example, eutrophication or \nembankments showing because of low flows and drawdown \ncan contribute to a negative experience for visitors (EEA, 2018b).\n\nAs the tourism industry has grown over the decades, millions \nof people in Europe and abroad are taking a holiday away from \nhome and visiting popular destinations. It has been estimated \nthat\tthis\tmobility\taccounts\tfor\taround\t9\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tannual\twater\t\nconsumption of the accommodation and food service sector \nin Europe (EEA, 2018b). The most important tourist attractions \nin Europe are large cities, such as Brussels, London, Paris and \nRome, and the coastal areas and islands of the Mediterranean, \nthe Baltic, the North Sea or the North-east Atlantic. Currently, \nEurope\tattracts\t50\u00a0%\tof\tglobal\tinternational\ttourist\tarrivals,\twith\t\nnearly\t20\u00a0%\tof\tthem\tarriving\tin\tthe\tMediterranean\t(UNWTO,\t\n2017). Tourism in Europe has reached record levels over the \nlast decade. It should be noted that tourism activities in the \nMediterranean peak during the summer season, at a similar \ntime to the peak in agricultural activities. This results in high \nlevels of seasonal water stress. It is estimated that the number \nof tourists who visit the Mediterranean areas annually is 16 \ntimes higher than the permanent population of these areas, \nwhile tourists' average daily water use is two to three times \nhigher than the locals' daily water use (Iglesias et al., 2007). \nIn the last decade, the number of nights spent by tourists in \nEurope\tincreased\tby\t30\u00a0%\tin\tsouthern\tEurope,\twhereas\tthere\t\n\nwas no significant change in other parts of Europe (Eurostat, \n2020b). Over the same period, water abstraction for tourism \nalmost doubled. The local and national economies of many \nsouthern European countries (e.g. Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Spain, \nTurkey) are largely dependent on tourism.\n\n4.7.1 Future outlook\n\nFuture developments in tourism will rely on health \nconsiderations related to external shocks such as COVID-19 \nand changes in the working and business environments. The \ntechnical water-saving measures that can be implemented \nin the tourism sector are similar to those for households. \nHowever, estimating the potential water savings for tourism \nremains difficult, as little information is available and the future \ndevelopment of this sector is not clear.\n\nIt has been estimated that the potential to save water in \nhotels, bed and breakfast facilities and camping sites is in \nthe\trange\tof\t30\u00a0%\tto\t50\u00a0%.\tFurthermore,\tthere\tare\tcases\tof\t\nindividual measures, such as technical interventions and \nawareness campaigns, which could result in significant gains \nof\tup\tto\t30\u00a0%.\tThe\twater-saving\tpotential\tis\teven\thigher\t(up\t\nto\t80\u00a0%)\tin\toutdoor\twater\tuses,\tsuch\tas\tirrigation\tof\tgreen\t\nspaces and golf courses, as well as in restaurants and cafes \n(Dworak\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02007).\n\f\n\u00a9 Orhan Kartal, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\n81Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 The average amount of water available per capita in Europe is 4\u00a0560\u00a0m3/year, with large geographical variation: from 120\u00a0m3 per \nyear in Malta to 70\u00a0000\u00a0m3 per year in Norway. Between 1990 and 2017, the amount of water available per inhabitant decreased in \nsouthern, western and northern Europe. An increase was observed in eastern Europe. These changes were largely driven by trends \nin population rather than climate change.\n\n\u2022 Water stress affects approximately 20\u00a0% of the European territory and 30\u00a0% of the European population on average every year.\n\n\u2022 In some parts of the EU, which in many cases are already water stressed, water consumption is increasing while water availability is \ndecreasing. In other parts, increasing efficiency of water use will help to keep pace with the impacts of climate change.\n\n\u2022 In all of the EU, climate variability is expected to increase, while urbanisation concentrates demand for water in urban areas. The \nexpected outcome is that in southern Europe water stress problems will become more pressing than they already are, while in an \nincreasing area of the EU water stress will be experienced irregularly but with increasing frequency and impact.\n\n5 \nWater stress in Europe\n\nBuilding on and combining the results of Chapter 3 (which \nexplains how water availability is affected by climate change) \nand Chapter 4 (which highlights the current situation and future \ntrends in water consumption), this chapter presents a brief \nsketch of current and future water stress in Europe.\n\n5.1 Per capita freshwater availability in Europe\n\nThe\tavailability\tof\tfreshwater\tper\tinhabitant\tin\tEurope\u00a0(14) \namounts\tto\t4\u00a0560\u00a0m3 per year (averaged over the period \n1990-2017). However, this availability is highly variable and \nunevenly distributed in both space and time (Figure 5.1). For \nexample, in 2017, renewable freshwater resources available \nper\tinhabitant\tranged\tbetween\t120\u00a0m3 per year in Malta to \n70\u00a0000\u00a0m3 per year in Norway. At smaller spatial scales, for \nexample when comparing a highly urbanised area with its \nsurrounding rural region, even more variation occurs.\n\nThe spatial and temporal variation in available freshwater \nresources is affected by numerous factors, such as global \n\nand regional climate circulation, hydrometeorology and \nlocal weather patterns, topography, land cover and use, and \nhydrogeology. Thus, low water availability can be a local \nissue that is not compensated for by high water availability \nin another part of the same country or region. Similarly, \nlow water availability can be a temporary issue that is not \ncompensated for by high water availability in another month \nor season of the year (e.g. a dry summer followed by a wet \nwinter). National and regional aggregates of freshwater \navailability should therefore be treated with caution, as they \nmay obscure the local or seasonal realities encountered by \nEuropean citizens.\n\nFreshwater availability alone is not an indication of high or low \nwater stress, as the concept of water stress compares the water \nconsumed by all socio-economic activities with the renewable \nfreshwater resources over a specified area and period. Thus, \nthe spatial distribution of population and socio-economic \nactivities and the timing of their demand for water must also \nbe factored in to identify a lack of capacity to meet local and \ntemporal needs for water.\n\n(14) Calculated as the ratio of the total volume of renewable freshwater resources and the total population in the EEA member and cooperating \ncountries (EEA-38) and the UK.\n\f\nWater stress in Europe \n\n82 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017, the amount of freshwater available \nper inhabitant decreased in southern, western and northern \nEurope. An increase was observed in eastern Europe. These \nchanges were largely driven by trends in population rather \nthan climate change. For example, in western Europe, annual \nrenewable\tfreshwater\tresources\tincreased\tby\t4\u00a0%,\twhile\tthe\t\nregional\tpopulation\tincreased\tby\t11\u00a0%.\tIn\teastern\tEurope\tthere\t\nwas an increase in available renewable freshwater resources, \nbut\tthere\twas\talso\ta\treduction\t(-6\u00a0%)\tin\tthe\tregional\tpopulation\t\n(EEA, 2018b).\n\nFreshwater availability is expected to decrease further in some \nparts of the continent, such as the Iberian Peninsula, due to \ndecreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and \nevapotranspiration (EEA, 2016f, 2017d, 2019g). The situation will be \naggravated by random drought events, which are becoming more \nfrequent\tand\tintense\tin\tthe\tcontext\tof\tclimate\tchange\t(EEA\u00a02019g).\t\nIn other parts of the continent, such as northern Europe, \nfreshwater availability is expected to increase. This is due to \nprojected increases in precipitation, including heavy precipitation \n\nFigure 5.1 Trends in water availability per inhabitant (m3/capita), 2000-2017\n\nNotes: *Trends\tin\twater\tavailability\tcan\tbe\tvery\tinfluenced\tby\tnatural\tvariations\tin\tthe\thydrological\tcycle,\tin\tparticular\tin\tMediterranean\tbasins,\t\nand\tby\tthe\treference\ttime\tperiod\tused\tfor\tthe\tanalysis.\tIn\tparticular,\tthe\tyear\t2000\twas\tsignificantly\twet\tin\tSpain.\t\n\nSources: EEA (2019l, 2021d); Eurostat (2020f).\n\n1 320\n\n1 629\n\n2 430\n\n2 042\n\n4 956\n\n4 902\n\n8 444\n\n2017\n\n3 060\n\n2 323\n\n3 286\n\n2 308\n\n8 159\n\n6 113\n\n9 477\n\n2010\n\n2 120\n\n2 438\n\n3 933\n\n4 146\n\n4 500\n\n7 728\n\n11 298\n\n2000\n\nItaly\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nSpain*\n\nRomania\n\nSwitzerland\n\nAustria\n\nCountry\n\nthat\tcreates\tproblems\twith\texcess\twater\t(e.g.\u00a0floods).\tHowever,\t\neven these areas are projected to face higher temperatures and \nevapotranspiration, less snow, and more frequent and intense \ndroughts than at present (see Chapter 3).\n\n5.2 Current water stress in Europe\n\n5.2.1 Annual water stress in Europe\n\nWater\tstress\taffects\tapproximately\t20\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEuropean\t\nterritory\tand\t30\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEuropean\tpopulation\ton\taverage\t\nevery year, based on the EEA's spatial analysis in indicator \nCSI\u00a0018\t(water\texploitation\tindex\tplus,\tWEI+)\t(Figure\t5.2;\tsee\t\nalso\tBox\u00a01.6)\t(EEA,\t2019g).\tThe\tcost\tof\teconomic\tdamage\t\nfrom\tdroughts\tis\tin\tthe\torder\tof\tEUR\u00a02-9\u00a0billion\tannually,\tnot\t\nincluding the unquantified damage to ecosystems and their \nservices\t(EEA,\u00a02020c;\tMaes\tet\tal.,\t2020).\n\f\nWater stress in Europe \n\n83Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nFigure 5.2 Population and area exposed to water stress conditions in Europe in summer, 1990-2015\n\nNote: Estimation\tbased\ton\ta\tWEI+\tof\t20\u00a0%\tand\tover.\n\nSource  EEA (2018b).\n\nArea affected by water stress conditions (Water Exploitation Index Plus (WEI+) \u2265 20)Population exposed to water stress conditions\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nPercentage\n\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n\f\nWater stress in Europe \n\n84 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nMap 5.1 Seasonal water exploitation index plus (WEI+) in European sub river basins, 2015\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n70\u00b060\u00b050\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0-10\u00b0-20\u00b0-30\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n40\u00b0\n\n0 500 1 000 1 500 kmOutside coverage\n\nNo data\n\nSub river basin without data\n\n\u2264 10\n10-20\n\n20-30\n30-40\n\n> 40\n\nPercentage\n\nSeasonal Water Exploitation Index Plus (WEI+) in European sub river basins, 2015\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\u00a9ESRI\n\nWinter Spring\n\nSummerAutumn\n\nNote: Assessments of the sustainability of water abstraction at the European level remain limited by data availability and the approach to the \ninterpretation\tof\twater\treturns.\tThis\tmay\tlead\tto\tlarge\tdifferences\tin\tthe\tEuropean\tWEI\tcompared\twith\tnational\tdata\tsets.\tAn\texample\t\nof this occurs in the south-western sub-basin of France along the Atlantic coast, an important maize production area.

On \nthe one hand, this is a result of naturally occurring low water \navailability and aridity, which are part of the local climate. On \nthe other hand, the water consumed by economic activities \nsuch as agriculture, public water supply, tourism and electricity \nproduction is relatively high compared with the local renewable \nfreshwater resources.\n\nWater stress increases between April and September, when \nwater demand for agriculture, drinking water supply, and \ntourism or recreation reaches a seasonal peak. Severe water \nstress problems are usually observed in areas with intensive \nagriculture, which have a high share of irrigated land and \nreceive large applications of irrigation water, fertilisers and \npesticides. In this context, agriculture causes water stress \nbecause it depletes natural water sources (e.g. rivers dry \nup, groundwater levels decrease critically) or pollutes local \nfreshwaters (e.g. high concentrations of pollutants exceeding \nlegal requirements for water quality). Agriculture-driven \npollution can make water resources unsuitable for other \npurposes downstream (e.g. drinking water), unless significant \ncosts are incurred for their treatment. Severe water stress \nproblems are also observed in coastal areas, because of high \nconcentrations of human activities, including tourism. In such \nareas, local freshwater availability is usually low compared with \nthe water supply required. In addition, the local water sources \nare vulnerable to saline intrusion. Therefore, pollution and poor \nwater quality can also be a reason for local water stress issues \nin various parts of Europe.\n\nWater stress issues also increasingly occur in parts of western, \neastern and northern Europe. Compared with the average \nregional conditions, water stress levels are generally high in \nthe wider area of Copenhagen (Denmark), London (United \nKingdom) and Stockholm (Sweden) and in the river basins of \nthe Loire (France), Meuse (France-Netherlands-Belgium), Oder \n(Germany-Poland) and Weser (Germany), as well as in several \nsub-basins of Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. This is usually \na result of urbanisation, rising living standards and locally \nsignificant demand for public water supply and cooling water \nused in the industry and energy sectors.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017 the abstracted volume of water in \nthe\t27\tEU\tMember\tStates\t(EU-27)\tand\tthe\tUK\tdeclined\tby\t9\u00a0%\t\nand in the EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-38) \nand\tthe\tUK\tby\t17\u00a0%\t(EEA,\t2018b).\tFurthermore,\tbetween\tthe\t\nfirst and second cycles of the implementation of the Water \nFramework Directive (2010 vs 2016), the area of groundwater \nbodies\taffected\tby\toverabstraction\tdecreased\tby\taround\t7\u00a0%\t\n\n(EEA, 2018d). These overall trends are encouraging, because \nthey show a tendency towards reduced pressures from water \nabstraction in Europe. However, it should not be overlooked \nthat water stress is a local and seasonal issue. Thus, overall \nreductions are not always informative about the actual severity \nof the problem at finer spatial and time scales. Similarly, water \nstress in rain-fed agriculture and in rain-dependent natural \nareas is not or barely mitigated by reduced water abstraction.\n\n5.3 Future projections of water stress \nin\u00a0Europe\n\nWater stress in Europe is expected to worsen in the future, as \na result of climate change and socio-economic development. \nIn\tthe\tPeseta\u00a0IV\tproject\tthe\tEuropean\tCommission\tJoint\t\nResearch Centre modelled two different emission scenarios, \nresulting\tin\tthree\tglobal\ttemperature\tincreases,\twith\t3\u00a0\u00b0C\tas\t\nthe highest, compared with pre-industrial levels (Bisselink \net\u00a0al.,\t2020)\t(Map\u00a05.2).\tFor\tan\tincrease\tin\tglobal\ttemperature\t\nof\t3\u00a0\u00b0C,\tconditions\tof\tsignificant\twater\tstress\twill\tbe\textended\t\nand intensified in southern Europe, as well as in other parts of \nEurope, including areas in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, \nPoland and Romania. Moreover, the duration of seasonal \nwater stress is projected to increase by up to a month, with \nthe highest increase expected in the Iberian Peninsula and \nother parts of the Mediterranean. In these calculations it was \nassumed that economic sectors' use of water increases as a \nratio of growth in gross domestic product (GDP), so increasing \nefficiency of water use was not included.\n\nCombining the findings of Chapters 3 and 4, the following \nestimate of the difference between water demand and \nwater availability emerges, and how it will develop over the \ncoming\u00a0decades.\n\n5.3.1 Potential impacts of climate change on water \navailability in future\n\nAs a result of climate change, the average availability of water \nin surface water and groundwater bodies is expected to \nincrease in north-eastern Europe and decrease in southern \nand south-western Europe, while mixed patterns are expected \nin\tthe\tcentral\tparts\tof\tEurope.\tUnder\tthe\t3\u00a0\u00b0C\ttemperature\t\nincrease scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) \nscenario 8.5), the mean summer discharge in Spain and other \nparts\tis\testimated\tto\tbecome\t20-40\u00a0%\tlower\tthan\tit\tis\tnow.\tIn\t\nparts of the other Mediterranean countries the impact is less \npronounced,\tbut\twith\treductions\tin\tthe\torder\tof\t10-20\u00a0%\tstill\t\nvery significant (Bisselink et al., 2020).

(2) General estimates at the whole EU level do not represent the local impact of water stress. For example, in Sections 4.3 and 4.6 it was \npointed out that the increase in the irrigated area and in per capita household water use is highest in southern Europe, which is already the most \nwater stressed region in Europe. (3) These estimates are therefore only indications of future trends in water stress.\n\f\nWater stress in Europe \n\n87Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nThat said, there are clear signs that water is being used more \nefficiently in the European economy. This will allow for better \naccommodation of environmental water demands (which \nhave not yet been assessed at EU level) and for climate \nchange\u00a0impacts.\n\nComparing the potential water savings with expected changes \nin water availability and water demand shows that, in some \nparts of Europe, the current pace of water saving in the \n\neconomy is sufficient to compensate for the decrease in water \navailability as a result of climate change. Environmental water \ndemands have not been accounted for in this comparison. The \nwater uses that directly depend on precipitation, such as rainfed agriculture and terrestrial nature, do not benefit from these \nwater savings. The impacts of increasing climate variability \nand the spatial concentration of water demand in households \nand industry, too, are not mitigated by increased efficiency of \nwater\u00a0use.\n\f\n\u00a9 Norbert Kerekes, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\n89Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\n6 \nSustainable solutions for \n\nwater stress management \nin\u00a0Europe\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 Progress in establishing ecological flows, and subsequently revising water permits, is slow.\n\n\u2022 Sustainable water management needs to rely more on water demand management, supply from alternative water resources, and \ncircular and nature-based solutions. Improvements in efficiency should be transparently documented to promote cross-fertilisation \nand transfer of technology and knowledge.\n\n\u2022 In areas where the problems cannot be solved in a sustainable way at a local or regional scale by current measures to manage \nwater demand, systemic changes are called for .\n\n\u2022 Given the significance of abstraction pressures on European water resources, sectoral policy interventions must not only work in \nsynergy with water policies but also actively support them.\n\n\u2022 A key factor contributing to the effectiveness of water directives are the (binding) cross-references to the objectives of the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD) in other EU policies. However, although the WFD has been in force for 20 years, few integrated \ngovernance frameworks have been implemented.\n\n\u2022 Only eight Member States reported drought management plans as accompanying documents to all or part of their second river \nbasin management plans.\n\n\u2022 Nature-based solutions can contribute to drought risk management through their integrative and stakeholder-driven approach and \ncan thus provide a link to nexus approaches and systemic change.\n\n\u2022 Major technological innovations that will contribute to improved drought risk management are expected in the field of Earth \nobservation, mobile data collection and data integration.\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n90 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n6.1 Principal strategies for managing \nwater\u00a0stress\n\nStrategies to combat water stress are similar for most economic \nsectors, if considered at a sufficiently abstract level, and they \ncan be divided broadly into four categories (Box 6.1). The water \nhierarchy (EC, 2007a) promotes the measures to be investigated \nconsecutively from top to bottom.\n\nBox 6.1  Principal strategies for managing \nwater\u00a0stress\n\n\u2022 Reduce water demand\n\n \u2013 Reduce losses in the supply system\n\n \u2013 Reduce losses during use\n\n \u2013 Raise awareness\n\n \u2013 Introduce economic measures\n\n \u2013 Apply more water-efficient technologies\n\n \u2013 Select products for their low water demand\n\n\u2022 Store water temporarily during \nwater-abundant\u00a0times\n\n \u2013 In surface reservoirs\n\n \u2013 In the soil and in aquifers, natural water \nretention measures and nature-based solutions\n\n\u2022 Accept shortage and focus on dealing with its \nconsequences\n\n \u2013 Prioritise water allocation\n\n \u2013 Introduce insurance schemes\n\n\u2022 Increase water availability or water supply\n\n \u2013 Reuse wastewater\n\n \u2013 Desalinate brackish or salt water\n\n \u2013 Divert water from water-abundant to \nwater-stressed locations (only if no other \noptions\u00a0remain)\n\nHowever, current practices show that the majority of measures \nare more sector-, time- and region-specific than strategies. \nShifting sectoral water management towards a more \nsustainable paradigm entails a series of challenges, because of \nthe trade-offs between making a sector less water intensive and \nkeeping up its production levels. The broad challenge, similar \nfor all types of water use, is to link water resources, resource \nefficiency and ecosystem conditions (thus addressing the need \nfor ecosystem-based management) in an integrated water \nresource management approach or a nexus approach. As a \ngeneral rule, practise more sustainable water management \nand put more reliance on water demand management, supply \nfrom alternative water resources, and circular and nature-based \nsolutions (NbS).\n\nEU Member States are planning and implementing a wide \nvariety of measures to tackle different aspects of water \nstress as part of their national programmes related to the \nimplementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The \nmeasures can be categorised as follows (Buchanan et al., 2019):\n\n\u2022 establishing water balances and water accounts;\n\n\u2022 establishing ecological flows (e-flows);\n\n\u2022 permitting, registration and control of water abstraction;\n\n\u2022 establishing pricing mechanisms promoting cost recovery \nand sustainable water management;\n\n\u2022 diversifying water sources, including using unconventional \nwater resources and water reuse;\n\n\u2022 establishing water-saving and water use efficiency schemes;\n\n\u2022 augmenting the water supply, including through new \nstorage areas and diversions, land use planning and natural \nwater retention measures.\n\nTaking into account overall policy provisions under the \nEuropean Green Deal and its supplementary initiatives, such \nas the circular economy, new climate change adaptation \nstrategy, farm to fork strategy, zero pollution action plan and \nbiodiversity strategy for 2030, various sustainable options for \nwater stress management should be explored at various spatial \nand temporal scales. Some of the key measures are addressed \nbelow as examples offering further inspiration.\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n91Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nTable 6.1 Derivation and implementation of ecological flows in the second RBMPs\n\nDerivation\tand\timplementation\tof\tecological\u00a0flows Member States\n\nEcological flows \nderived\n\nin all water bodies All RBDs:\tCY,\tEE,\tES,\tHU,\tNL\n\nSome RBDs: FR (4 RBDs), IT (2 RBDs)\n\nin some water bodies \n(work is still ongoing)\n\nAll RBDs: AT, CZ, DK, RO, SE, SI\n\nIn some RBDs: BE (1 RBD), BG (1 RBD), DE (7 RBDs), \nFI (7 mainland RBDs), FR (10 RBDs), PL (8 RBDs), PT (9 RBDs), \nUK (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales)\n\nEcological flows \nimplemented\n\nin all water bodies All RBDs:\tCY,\tHU,\tNL\n\nSome RBDs: FR (2 RBDs)\n\nin some water bodies \n(work is still ongoing)\n\nAll RBDs: AT, CZ, EE, ES, RO, SE, SI\n\nSome RBDs: BG (1 RBD), DE (7 RBDs), FR (2 RBDs), IT (2 RBDs), \nPL (8 RBDs), PT (8 RBDs), UK (England, Scotland, Wales)\n\nEcological flows derived but not implemented but there \nare plans to do so in third cycle\n\nAll RBDs: DK\n\nSome RBDs: BE (1 RBD), FI (7 mainland RBDs), UK (Northern Ireland)\n\nEcological flows not derived but there are plans to do so \nin third cycle\n\nAll RBDs: HR, LU, LV, MT, SK, \n\nSome RBDs: BE (7 RBDs), BG (3 RBDs), IT (5 RBDs), PL (1 RBD),  \nPT (1 RBD)\n\nEcological flows not derived and no plans to do so in third cycle DE (3 RBDs), FI (1 RBD), IT (1 RBD), PL (1 RBD)  \n\nNote: For\tsome\tof\tthe\tRBDs\twhere\tthere\tis\tno\tintention\tto\tderive\tecological\tflows,\tthis\tis\tbecause\tno\triver\twater\tbodies\tare\treported.\n\nSource: EC (2019b).\n\n6.2\t Establishing\tecological\tflows\n\nA flow regime that is based on environmental requirements \nis a prerequisite for achieving good ecological status in rivers \n(EC,\u00a02016).\tEstablishing\tecologically\tbased\tflow\tregimes\t(Box\t\n6.2) is therefore an important measure in the river basin \nmanagement plans (RBMPs) (EC, 2019b). In most Member \nStates, work on defining and implementing ecological flows \n\nwas still ongoing in the second cycle (EC, 2019b). In the second \nRBMPs, ecological flows were reported to have been derived \nand implemented for all relevant water bodies in only three \nMember States. In the majority of Member States, ecological \nflows have been derived and implemented for only a subset \nof all water bodies, either in all or in part of their river basin \ndistricts (RBDs) (Table 6.1).\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n92\n\nBox 6.2 Indicators for defining sustainability in \nwater use\n\nSetting a global threshold in identifying sustainable \nuse of water resources is a scientific challenge. For the \ntime being, overall, three different indicators are widely \nimplemented to define whether water use is sustainable \nor not. These indicators are:\n\n\u2022 Ecological flows indicating critical stages and \ndischarges. In principle, the methods for defining \necological flows can be classified into four major \ncategories: (1) hydrological methods; (2) hydraulic \nrating; (3) habitat simulation models; and (4) holistic \nmethodologies (Zeiringer et al., 2018). An inventory \nby Ramos et al. (2018) reveals that, in most cases \nwhere ecological flows have been derived, they \nwere mainly based on hydrological methods. This \nmeans that a static or dynamic fraction of the mean \nannual flow is defined as ecological flow without \nmaking an explicit link to ecological variables. In \naddition, most respondents do not differentiate \necological flows between dry and normal years. \nIn terms of critical stages and discharges of rivers \nand artificial canals, ecological flows are defined as \nminimum flow requirements using hydrological and \nhydroecological methods (EC, 2016).\n\n\u2022 Critical levels of water stress, e.g. water exploitation \nindex plus (WEI+) (Raskin and Gleick, 1997). \nThe\tindicator\ttakes\t20\u00a0%\tof\twater\tabstraction\t\nfrom water availability in the environment as an \nindication of water stress.

National policies related to territorial \nplanning and economic development plans could promote \nthese approaches more in the future (Buchanan et al., 2019) \n(see Section 6.2). The recent adoption of the EU biodiversity \nstrategy for 2030, which explicitly states the importance of \nrestoring freshwater ecosystems and river continuity, sets out \nthe\tambitious\tgoal\tof\trestoring\t25\u00a0000\u00a0km\tof\tfree-flowing\trivers\t\nby 2030.\n\n6.4.2 Managed aquifer recharge\n\nManaged aquifer recharge (MAR) is one of the options to \nimprove aquifer conditions and raise groundwater levels, \nprovided that it is done in compliance with the WFD and \nGroundwater Directive (EU, 2006). For instance, particular \nattention should be given to the quality of the water used in \nthe process (to avoid pollutants entering the groundwater \nbody and not compromise environmental objectives). MAR \nis the intentional recharge of water to suitable aquifers for \nsubsequent recovery or to realise environmental benefits; \nthe managed process should ensure adequate protection of \nhuman health and the environment. MAR can also reduce \nthe occurrence and degree of flooding. Various methods \nare used to recharge aquifers, including bank infiltration, \ninfiltration in boreholes and wells, in-channel interception and \nrun-off harvesting. Some of these methods are more nature \nbased than others, for example infiltration from wells may \nbe considered a less natural approach. MAR is already widely \npractised across the world. The most common incentives are to \nincrease the buffering capacity to withstand seasonal droughts, \nto manage saline intrusion and to create a strategic reserve for \nemergency situations. The benefits may extend to the ecology \nof the area and in specific cases to protecting wooden pilings or \nmanaging land subsidence.\n\n6.4.3 Applying ecosystem services in water stress \nmanagement\n\nLooking at water stress from an ecosystem services perspective \nputs a strong focus on combinations of economic benefits for \nwater-using sectors and of environmental and social values. \nThis broadened scope is required to solve the problems caused \nby more traditional practices. As IPBES states (IPBES, 2019): \n'Economic incentives have generally favoured expanding \neconomic activity, and often environmental harm, over \nconservation or restoration. Incorporating the consideration \nof the multiple values of ecosystem functions and of nature's \ncontributions to people into economic incentives has, in the \n\neconomy, been shown to permit better ecological, economic \nand social outcomes.'\n\nThere are two ecosystem services that come to the fore in the \ncontext of water stress management: (1) provision of water; \nand\u00a0(2)\ttemporary\tstorage\tof\twater\tin\taquifers,\trivers\tand\t\nlakes during the wet season for use in dry spells. In addition, \nwater bodies have an attenuating effect on temperature \nfluctuations during heatwaves, especially in urban areas (i.e. \nacting as a regulating service, connected to climate regulation \nas a prominent ecosystem service) (Maes et al., 2020).\n\nTemporary water storage in aquifers and lakes helps \nto maintain, in parallel, the base flow in rivers during \ndry spells, thus providing the necessary conditions for \nwater-dependent ecosystems. Unsustainable water \nabstraction and land use changes causing rapid discharge \nof water during rainfall events, and a decrease in surface \nwater storage and groundwater recharge, have led to a \ndecrease in both ecosystem services (see Section 3.3). This \ndecrease is in some cases exacerbated by water quality \nproblems, such as eutrophication and algal blooms in \nsurface waters that become stagnant, saltwater intrusion \nin coastal areas, or reaching arsenic-contaminated water in \noverexploited\u00a0aquifers.\n\nThe benefits of restoring ecosystem services to their natural \nlevel extend well beyond the interests of the economic sectors \nand stakeholders that have caused the deterioration. The case \nfor an ecosystem services approach can thus only be made \nif the affected stakeholders are known and involved in the \nassessment. Over recent years much research has aimed at \nmapping ecosystem services and quantifying their economic \nimpacts for a wide range of water-dependent sectors. \nExamples that deal specifically with water stress, however, \nare scarce. The recent exercise, mapping an assessment \nof ecosystems and their services (MAES) (Maes et al., 2020) \ndoes not include ecosystem services specifically connected \nto water stress, but it illustrates how the degradation of \necosystems hampers their provisioning services (which also \nrelate to water, both in quantity and quality). It thus provides a \nframework for future analysis of water stress.\n\nThe examples in Box 6.3 provide an overview of the state of \nplay with regard to applying the ecosystem services concept \nto water stress problems. Many initiatives are already evolving \nand good progress is being made in Europe. Knowledge gaps \nto be bridged include connecting ecological status to drought \nor stress indicators and putting a value on the appreciation of \nenvironmental quality.\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n97Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n6.5 Towards managing the water-energyfood-ecosystems nexus \n\nSocieties around the world have always been aware \nthat water, energy, land and food resources are \ninterdependent, while they also interact with natural \necosystems. Policy and research have addressed this \nidea already since the late 1940s and 1960s (Wichelns, \n2017). The International Conference on Water and \nthe Environment in Dublin and the UN Conference on \nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, which \nwere held in 1992, contributed to the development of the \nprinciples that characterise the integrated water resources \nmanagement (IWRM) paradigm. The Global Water \nPartnership initiative summed up IWRM in the following \ndefinition in 2000 (Global Water Partnership, 2000): 'A \nprocess which promotes the coordinated development \nand management of water, land and related resources, \nin order to maximize the resultant economic and social \nwelfare in an equitable manner without compromising the \nsustainability of vital ecosystems.'\n\nTherefore, the IWRM paradigm specifically addresses three \npillars, namely environmental sustainability, economic \nefficiency and social justice, which are also used to \ndescribe our understanding of sustainable management. \nFurthermore, it makes specific reference to 'water, land and \n\nrelated resources' and to the need to protect and conserve \n'vital\u00a0ecosystems'.\n\nNevertheless, research and policy have often developed in \n'working silos' over recent decades, as a result of scientific \nspecialisation and administrational mandate. This has resulted \nin separate and often conflicting sectoral goals, strategies and \npolicies,\tas\twell\tas\tfragmented\tactions\toverall\t(Leck\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015).\t\nFurthermore, while research has also addressed the \ninteractions between different resources, the relevant studies \nhave mostly focused on the interactions between water \nand another resource (e.g. water-energy or water-food), \nthus missing a more holistic and systemic perspective \n(Endo\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017).\n\nThe water-energy-land-food nexus is a holistic conceptual \nframework, which underlines the need for integrated and \nsystemic thinking and for cross-sectoral and multi-scale actions \nfor the protection and management of resource systems. \nWhile it carries the legacy of the IWRM paradigm, it also \nconsiders the experiences gained from its implementation, \nand it modifies and expands it. The EEA has recently advocated \nthe use of the water-energy-land-materials-ecosystem \nservices nexus ('resource nexus') for systemic analysis of \nproduction-consumption systems (see Box 6.4).\n\nBox 6.3 Examples of analytical frameworks on ecosystem services assessment\n\nThe\tKnowledge\tInnovation\tProject\ton\tan\tintegrated\tsystem\tfor\tnatural\tcapital\tand\tecosystem\tservices\taccounting\t(KIP\u00a0INCA)\tis\t\npreparing, at the time of writing this report, several outputs: accounts on ecosystem extent and ecosystem condition; accounts \non ecosystem services; and a valuation of natural capital and ecosystem services. Water abstraction is one of the provisioning \nservices that is analysed in the project (EC, 2020g). A question to be answered is 'What is the value of ecosystems in reducing or \npreventing\twater\tstress?'\t(by\tanalogy\twith\tthe\tvalue\tof\tecosystems\tin\tflood\tcontrol,\twhich\twas\testimated\tat\tEUR\u00a016\u00a0billion\tfor\tthe\t\nEU-27 and the UK in 2012 (Petersen, 2019)).\n\nThe Blue2 project mapped the size and impacts of four environmental pressures and assessed a selection of related \nmeasures. One of the pressures considered is water abstraction. To compare and appreciate the different model outcomes \nfor the measures considered, a step-wise approach was developed, based on estimations of the value of ecosystem services \nby willingness-to-pay (WTP) approaches (Schasfoort et al., 2018). Some data are available in the literature on the WTP for \nan improvement or deterioration of ecological status. Apart from the uncertainties and discussions of WTP approaches, a \nmethodological difficulty that remains to be solved is connecting a step up or down in ecological status to one of the available \ndrought indicators (e.g. water exploitation index plus or Q10 flow indicator).\n\nOn a similar note, the Dessin project on demonstrating how ecosystem services can enable innovation in the water sector aimed \nto establish the link between Water Framework Directive water body environmental status and ecosystem condition (in the \nDrivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses framework). The focus on beneficiaries allows clearer identification of co-benefits and \nthe incorporation of economic values, both relevant for the integrated management of water resources (Anzaldua et al., 2018).\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n98 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nBox 6.4 Development of the nexus concept\n\nThe nexus concept was first introduced in 2011, when the World Economic Forum published a report on the \nwater-food-energy-climate nexus (Waughray, 2011) and the German Federal Government organised the Bonn 2011 \nInternational Conference with the theme 'The water, energy and food security nexus \u2014 solutions for the green economy' \n(Martin-Nagle et al., 2012). The links to biodiversity, ecosystems and their services were also highlighted in subsequent \nresearch publications (Karabulut et al., 2016). Thus, the core of the nexus is often expanded to include further considerations, \nsuch as interactions with climate and ecosystems, and to address not only resources themselves but also the management \nobjectives for the resources (e.g. water, energy and food security concerns). The nexus concept has also been studied in the \ncontext of transboundary river basin management in the Mekong river (Keskinen et al., 2015) and the Upper Blue Nile (Allam \nand Eltahir, 2019).The overall concept of the nexus formed the underlying basis for the establishment of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by the United Nations in 2015. These global goals highlight the need for systemic approaches to meeting \ntheir targets, including those goals related to resource management (Weitz et al., 2014).\n\nIn 2019, the EEA advocated the 'resource nexus' concept as one of the main approaches to systemic analysis of synergies \nand trade-offs to achieve a sustainable transition of the European economy (EEA, 2019j). In this case, water, land, energy \nand ecosystems services, as well as materials, are considered interdependent resources, which are exploited by the \nfood system and other production-consumption systems (e.g. energy system, mobility system). Production-consumption \nsystems contribute to human well-being, relying on the intake of resources from the environment and affecting the \nenvironment through emissions and waste (Figure 6.3).\n\nFigure 6.3 Proposed set-up for understanding the water-energy-land-materials-ecosystem services \nnexus and its interactions with production-consumption systems\n\nSource: EEA (2019j).\n\nWhile the discussion on nexuses has been widely theoretical or related to assessment studies, putting nexuses into \npractice in real-life applications has been limited in Europe and worldwide (Bizikova et al., 2013; Leck et al., 2015). The \nrecently formed Nexus Cluster is developing a list of relevant projects around the globe, including research projects funded \nby the EU (e.g. Sim4Nexus): https://www.nexuscluster.eu/Projects.aspx\n\nAb\nio\n\nti\nc \n\nna\ntu\n\nra\nl c\n\nap\nit\n\nal Biotic natural capital\n\nEnergy\n\nM\nat\n\ner\nia\n\nls\n\nWater\n\nLand\n\nEcosystem\n servicesHuman\n\nwell-being\n\nInterdependence among resources\n\nEmissions and wastes flows\n\nNature's contributions to people\n\nProduction and\nconsumption\n\nsystems\n\nFood, energy, mobility\n\nhttps://www.nexuscluster.eu/Projects.aspx\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n99Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nA systemic analysis of water stress drivers, pressures and impacts \ncan help researchers, water practitioners and policymakers \nto develop a wider and more holistic understanding of the \ninterdependent relationships between water, energy, food, \necosystem services, and their further relationships with climate. \nAdopting separate policy goals and management practices \nfor each of these systems can create trade-offs, whereby the \nbenefits from using one resource may critically limit the benefits \nfrom using another resource (e.g. expansion of farmed land \nfor food production causing overexploitation and pollution of \ngroundwater, thus limiting the availability of groundwater of \nsufficient quality for drinking, etc.). Integrated management \nresponses can find compromise solutions that deliver working \nresults for sustainable management of both resources. \nFurthermore, win-win synergies can be explored for reaping the \nbenefits from the use of more than one resource: for example, \nwater reuse can reduce the need for groundwater abstraction \nfrom overexploited aquifers, as well as the need for fertilisation \nbecause of the nutrient content of reclaimed water, and the \nincreased needs for energy to generate reclaimed water can be \noffset by the reduced energy needed for pumping groundwater \nand for producing and applying fertilisers (Ringler et al., 2013; \nPsomas et al., 2018).\n\n6.6 Need for policy responses that promote \nsystemic change\n\nMainstreaming water management considerations into other \nenvironmental and sectoral policies and finding synergies \nacross them are key to enabling sustainable water management \nand reducing society's exposure and vulnerability to water \nstress. The recent WFD fitness check highlighted that one of \nthe factors contributing to the effectiveness of water directives \nin progressing towards their objectives are the (binding) \ncross-references to the WFD's objectives in other EU policies \n(EC et al., 2019). However, despite the WFD being in force for \n20 years, few integrated governance frameworks have been \nimplemented (EC et al., 2019). Until recently, sectoral policies \nat EU level even contributed to increasing pressures on water \nresources, for instance by promoting agricultural development, \nindustrial growth or the development of hydropower without \nsufficient environmental safeguards (Rouillard et al., 2018; \nCarvalho et al., 2019; Kampa et al., 2020).\n\nUnder the Sixth and Seventh Environment Action Programmes \n(2002-2012 and 2014-2020, respectively), greater attention was \ngiven to aligning sectoral policy objectives with environmental \ntargets. To tackle threats from water stress, the focus has been \non promoting efficient use of water in economic activities. \nThe 2011 Roadmap to a resource efficient Europe, the 2020 \ncommunication on a new circular economy, and many of \nthe initiatives under the European Innovation Partnership \non Water, as well as those funded through the Horizon 2020 \nresearch programme, include technological innovations for \nincreasing water efficiency in production systems, as well as \nfor waste minimisation and recycling strategies. This effectively \n\nopened a channel for the more active involvement of the \nindustrial sector in EU environmental research and innovation \nactivities and strengthened corporate social responsibility \nand extended producer responsibility schemes. The proposal \nfor the Eighth Environment Action Programme (8th EAP) (EC, \n2020h), published in 2020, endorses the environmental goals \nof the European Green Deal and is meant to support the \nimplementation and enforcement of its environmental and \nclimate policies, in part through the roll-out of a new monitoring \nframework. This is relevant to EU water policy in general, as \nmonitoring, implementation and enforcement are aspects in \nwhich shortcomings have been recurrent. Among its priority \nobjectives, the proposed 8th EAP includes decoupling economic \ngrowth from resource use and enhancing natural capital \n(including water resources and freshwater ecosystems).\n\nAs shown in Chapter 4, manufacturing is the sector in which \ndecoupling is the most prominent, and this is reflected in \nall EU regions. To ensure the continuity of this trend and its \nreplication in other economic activities, it is crucial to learn \nfrom these developments. Specifically, in the case of the \nindustrial sector, sharing data on investments in water-saving \ntechnologies would be fundamental from both the water and \nthe resource efficiency policy perspectives. Improvements in \nefficiency stemming from implementations at the company \nlevel should be more transparently documented to promote \ntechnology/knowledge transfer and cross-fertilisation. This \nrequires a reporting architecture that centralises the knowledge \nwhile protecting the strategic interests of private enterprises. \nAny progress made here could open up pathways to increase \ntransparency in other sectors such as agriculture, mining and \nquarrying and establish a benchmark for concrete, integrated \naction to achieve systemic change.\n\n6.6.1 Water-dependent ecosystems\n\nWhen developing their RBMPs under the WFD, authorities must \npay particular attention to wetlands, which are often protected \nunder the Birds Directive (EU, 2009b) and Habitats Directive \n(EU, 1992). These two directives have commonly been used to \nreinforce the case for reducing abstraction pressures in surface \nwater and groundwater, leading to the degradation of wetlands \nand groundwater-dependent ecosystems.\n\nAlthough the abstraction pressure on renewable freshwater \nresources has started to decline over recent decades (see \nChapter 4), substantial improvements are not yet seen in the \nquantitative status of groundwater bodies. There are two \npotential reasons for this. Firstly, groundwater flow and flush-out \nof pollutants is a slow and complex process in certain types \nof aquifers, so there can be a long lag time between reducing \nabstraction and significant recovery of groundwater levels. \nSecondly, climate change and socio-economic development (e.g. \npopulation growth, land use change) may aggravate existing \nwater balance deficits, thus overriding the gains from recently \nimplemented measures (Psomas et al., 2021).\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n100 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nSeveral EU initiatives more or less indirectly support the use of \nNbS to enhance Europe's vulnerability to water stress and risk \nof droughts. The multifunctional role of forests in regulating \nwater flows in rural and urban catchments and in increasing \nresilience to climate change is recognised by the new EU forest \nstrategy (EC, 2021b). Wetlands and forests for instance form \nan important part of the EU strategy on green infrastructure, \nwhich aims to build a coherent and resilient network of \necological corridors across Europe. The recent biodiversity \nstrategy\tfor\t2030\tsets\tout\tto\tlegally\tprotect\ta\tminimum\tof\t30\u00a0%\t\nof\tthe\tEU's\u00a0land\tarea\tand\tto\tpromote\twidespread\trestoration.\t\nThe strategy emphasises in particular the importance of \nrestoring ecological flows in rivers, notably through a review \nof abstraction permits. Furthermore, the still elusive, yet \nachievable co-benefits of green infrastructure and NbS pursued \nin the policies mentioned represent a focus for economic \nactivities such as tourism, recreation, sustainable agriculture \nand urban water services. This is especially relevant as an \nopportunity to address water abstraction, resulting in multiple \npressures\ton\tfreshwater\u00a0ecosystems.\n\n6.6.2 Circular economy and water reuse\n\nOne example of this integrated thinking, from a circular \neconomy perspective, is the adoption of the Water Reuse \nRegulation\t(EU,\t2020b),\tpreviously\tintroduced\tin\tSection\u00a06.3.1.\t\nThis new regulation will enable the scaling up of small \nexperimental projects and local initiatives and will widen the \n\nscope of water reuse applications in Europe. Here, the notion of \n'getting the economics right', included in the circular economy \naction plan, is a shared principle for water policy, and it will \nbe fundamental for the successful implementation of the \nnew Water Reuse Regulation. An important consideration is \nthat, where water is scarce, the benefit of reuse is to alleviate \npressures on surface water and groundwater bodies stemming \nfrom agricultural abstraction and from pollution from waste \nwater discharges. However, to effectively reduce abstraction \npressure, reuse must act as a substitute for existing abstraction \nand not as an additional source of water for irrigation \n(Drewes\u00a0et\tal.,\t2017).\n\n6.6.3 Water pricing, cost recovery and \nsustainable\u00a0finance\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, gaps remain in setting pricing \nstrategies that effectively lead to the efficient use of water. \nThe recent evaluation of the second RBMPs found that a \nnumber of Member States have upgraded their water pricing \npolicies, notably by fulfilling the ex-ante conditionality for water \nunder the Common Provisions Regulation for the European \nStructural and Investment Funds for the period 2014-2020. \nFurthermore, increased funding and investments are still \nnecessary to meet the objectives of the WFD (EC, 2019b). Here, \nthe\twider\texploitation\tof\tEU\tfunds,\tincluding\tthe\tEUR\u00a01\u00a0trillion of \nsustainable investments over the next decade pledged through \nthe Green Deal investment plan, should finally happen. They \n\n\u00a9 Stephane Isoard\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n101Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nshould also be used to leverage private investment employing \nthe EU taxonomy for sustainable finance (contributing to \nachieving the third environmental objective of the taxonomy: \n'Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources') \nand the new policy tools that will emerge from the renewed \nsustainable finance strategy. This complementary source \nof much-needed funding could be used to promote more \nambitious planning and implement measures that help correct \nimbalances in cost bearing, effectively levelling the playing field \nfor different water users (including the environment). However, \nany future investments must take account of past experiences.\n\n6.6.4 Water and agriculture\n\nThe common agricultural policy (CAP) programming period \nfor 2014-2020 aimed to incentivise sustainable management \nof water in agriculture by linking CAP payments to compliance \nwith the national legislation that implements the WFD. To \nreceive payments, farmers had to comply with good agricultural \nand environmental conditions (GAEC), one of which was a \nrequirement to comply with authorisation procedures for water \n\nabstraction\t(i.e.\tGAEC\u00a02).\tIn\taddition,\tthe\tEuropean\tAgricultural\t\nFund for Rural Development (EAFRD) recognised efficient \nwater use as a key strategic objective for European agriculture, \nand support was available through rural development plans \nfor sustainable investment in conserving water, improving \nirrigation infrastructures and enabling farmers to improve \nirrigation techniques. Given the high cost of switching to more \nefficient water use, rural development plans have been pivotal \nin supporting investments in improving the efficiency of the \nuse\tof\tirrigation\twater\tin\tagriculture.\tIn\t2018,\tmore\tthan\t5\u00a0%\tof\t\nirrigated land in the EU-27 was under management contracts to \nimprove water use efficiency (EC, 2021b). \n\nArticle 46 of the EAFRD 2014-2020 required that investments \nin new and existing irrigation systems comply with specific \nwater-saving requirements, with view to limiting the potential \nto increase water stress and avoid the rebound effect \n(see\u00a0Box\u00a06.5).\tSome\tcountries,\tsuch\tas\tCroatia,\twent\tbeyond\t\nthese minimum requirements and required water savings of \nat\tleast\t25\u00a0%\tto\tbe\teligible\tto\treceive\tsupport\tfor\tmodernising\t\nof irrigation equipment and improving the efficiency of \nwater\u00a0use.\t\n\nBox 6.5 Managing the rebound effect and the Jevons paradox in water stress situations\n\nIncreasing the efficiency of production is one of the main goals of European policies, with the overall goal being to decouple \neconomic growth from resource use. However, improvements in the efficiency of resource use do not always translate \ninto net savings, because producers and consumers adapt their behaviour (Paul et al., 2019). The rebound effect refers to \nthe situation in which efficiency gains do not result in a reduction in resource use. In some cases, the same chain of events \neven results in higher net resource consumption; this is known as the Jevons paradox.\n\nThe rebound effect can occur when efficiency improvements affect consumers' positive perception of the final product, \nleading to less restraint in its consumption or in the consumption of other products. It can also occur when efficiency \nimprovements affect economic performance by reducing production costs. This may lead to increased production, \nreduction in product prices, or cost saving being used to expand production elsewhere. Psychosocial and economic \nrebound effects lead to increased demand (Paul et al., 2019). The rebound effect is well documented on the consumption \nof a number of resources, such as energy use.\n\nIn water management, there is substantial evidence for the rebound effect in irrigation water use, where the adoption \nof more water-efficient devices is not necessarily accompanied by a reduction in water abstraction (Ward and \nPulido-Velazquez, 2008; Dumont et al., 2013; G\u00f3mez and P\u00e9rez-Blanco, 2014; Berbel et al., 2015, 2018). In some cases, the \nsaved water can be redirected to other beneficial economic uses, for instance higher value but more water-consuming \ncrops or an expansion in the area of irrigated land. As a result, this may lead to a reduction in field water losses, reduced \ninfiltration and percolation, and reduced groundwater recharge and return flows to surface water bodies. \n\nIn other cases, such as in the Mancha Oriental in Spain, increasing efficiency has been accompanied with a reduction \nin total water consumption, despite  an increase in the irrigated area (JCRMO, 2019). In this case, the modernisation \nof irrigation infrastructure occurred in conjunction with greater controls over water use by the organisation in \ncharge of monitoring and controlling its use. Thus, the net effect of adopting more efficient irrigation systems on \nagricultural abstraction pressure depends on several factors, including technological, agronomic and climatic conditions \n(e.g.\u00a0influencing\tirrigated\tcrop\tevapotranspiration)\tand\tthe\tactions\timplemented\tin\taddition\tof\tthe\tincremental\tgains\t\nin\u00a0efficiency.\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n102 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nThe new CAP programming cycle for 2021-2027 provides \nfresh opportunity to integrate more ambitious environmental \nobjectives that acknowledge local water resource limitations \nand scarcity situations. In particular, the new 'eco-schemes' \naim to support farmers who observe agricultural practices that \nare beneficial to the environment and climate. New indicators \nare included in the Commission's proposal to assess the \nCAP's contribution to the objective of fostering sustainable \ndevelopment and efficient management of natural resources \nsuch as water. For instance, the water exploitation index Plus \n(WEI+) is included as a new impact indicator on water resources. \nIt can contribute to improving the measurement of how the \nobjectives related to the conservation of water resources are \nmet in the long term and for future policy design. \n\nGiven the significance of agricultural abstraction pressures \non European water bodies, additional efforts are necessary \nto better integrate the objectives of the different policies, \nand it is essential that future agricultural policy interventions \nnot only work in synergy with water policies but also actively \nsupport them. Potential additional requirements under CAP \nconditionalities could be minimum efficiency standards for the \nirrigation infrastructure associated with a water permit. \n\nIn the funding available under rural development plans \n(2014-2020), the water-saving targets were not accompanied \nby a requirement to adjust water permits and ensure water \nsavings from increased efficiency that benefited the water \nbalances of linked surface water and groundwater bodies. \nOverall, investments in water efficiency programmes should \nbe accompanied by a careful consideration of water balances \nat farm, aquifer and basin level, including consideration of \nsurface-groundwater exchanges (EC, 2015d). Clear limits on \nresource use should accompany efficiency targets and should \nbe established at hydrologically relevant spatial scales. Policies \npromoting more efficient use of natural resources should also \ninclude a realistic assessment of the possible savings and the \nimpact of the policy on the producer and consumer impact.\n\nFurthermore, some rural development plans in the period \n2014-2020 integrated measures for adopting climate adaptation \nand the need to build resilience into farming systems through \nappropriate crop diversification (e.g. in Greece) and adopting \ndrought-resistant crops (in Romania) (Berglund et al., 2017). \nIn view of climate change impacts, the next CAP programming \nperiod should ensure that countries support the adoption \nof crops or varieties/hybrids with a reduced requirement for \nwater and more resistance to droughts and the adoption \nof appropriate soil management practices, following the \nprinciples of agroecology and organic farming, to increase farm \nresilience while preserving water resources. Although CAP \nsupport for agroecological practices and organic farming has \nincreased\tin\tthe\trecent\treforms,\tmore\tsupport\twill\u00a0\tbe\tneeded\t\nto reduce agricultural pressures on the environment and \nfoster a large-scale transition towards more sustainable and \nresilient\u00a0farming\tsystems.\n\nIt will also be important to overcome the known limitations in \nterms of the institutional and technical capacities for monitoring \nand enforcement. The requirements for implementing the WFD \nhave motivated water authorities to push water suppliers to \nimprove data collection, organisation and reporting. For example, \nwater utilities and irrigation cooperatives have accelerated the \ninstallation of water meters or improved their maintenance and \nrepair (Buchanan et al., 2019). However, opportunities remain. \nFor instance, the data and statistics reported frequently lack \nthe necessary accuracy, because of the issue of overabstraction \n(including incidents of unauthorised and unregistered abstraction). \nThe challenge is most serious in the agricultural sector and \nparticularly in southern Europe (Buchanan et al., 2019). \n\nDigitalisation has already become common in all sectors, but the \nexploration and validation of its potential applications differs by \nsector (e.g. energy is a frontrunner, water follows slowly). In the \ncontext of the updated EU digital strategy, this should be seen \nas an opportunity to use the experience of sectors that are well \nahead to leapfrog towards meaningful and effective exploitation \nof digital solutions. For implementing water policy, digital \napplications could facilitate data collection and information \nsharing while reducing the administrative burden associated with \nreporting. Digitalising water is also seen as an enabler of circular \neconomy models (e.g. turning waste water treatment plants into \n'blue\tresource\tcentres'\u00a0(20)) and could have potential to increase \nparticipation and mutual learning to identify new and innovative \nways of overcoming the societal challenges of our era.\n\nThe slow transition towards sustainable water use in agriculture \nis linked to the costs and complexities not only of modifying \nfarm systems but also of reforming whole production and \nconsumption systems (EC, 2020j). Transforming agricultural \nsystems to tackle water scarcity issues and to become more \nresilient to droughts requires a transition in supply chains and \nconsumer demand to give the right market signals to farmers \n(EEA, 2017b). The new farm to fork strategy illustrates how the \nEuropean Green Deal aims to support such integrated and \nsystemic thinking and promote more sustainable food systems. \nEmphasis is given not only to providing the right incentives \nto producers but also to leveraging sustainable investments \nfrom food system stakeholders (such as cooperatives and \nsupermarkets), reducing waste throughout the food chain, and \nmoving consumption patterns towards sustainable diets to \nreduce the total demand for natural resources, including water \n(EEA,\u00a02021c).\n\n6.6.5 Renewable energy systems\n\nSuch systemic thinking to reduce Europe's vulnerability to water \nstress still has to permeate policies in other economic sectors, \nalthough some safeguards already exist. For instance, the \n2030 climate target plan and the EU strategy for energy system \nintegration are major EU policy areas that drive substantial \nlevels of investment, notably towards renewable energy. \n\n(20) For more information see: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/690323\n\nhttps://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/690323\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n103Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\nAchieving a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050, without increasing \nthe pressure on freshwater resources, requires shifting \nthe focus onto the systemic challenges characterising this \ntransition. Low-carbon technologies should be considered not \nonly from the perspective of expected gains in CO2 emissions \nbut also from the perspective of their water requirements \n(Magagna et al., 2019) (Box 6.6), because some renewable \nsources of energy can increase water scarcity and vulnerability \nto droughts, for instance the large-scale adoption of biofuels or \nhydropower affecting the hydrology and hydromorphological \ndynamics of surface water bodies (Vanham et al., 2019). \nDirective 2009/28/EC (EU, 2009a) on the promotion of the use \nof energy from renewable resources recognises this when it \ncalls for using sustainability criteria when cultivating crops for \nbiofuels. In such cases, Member States will need to ensure that \nenergy policies do not encourage the expansion of irrigation \nfor the production of bioenergy where basins and aquifers \nare already overexploited. Currently, no Member States have \nsuch a safeguard in place. With the renewed and expanded \ncommitments on climate neutrality and 80\u00a0%\tof electricity to \nbe produced from renewable sources by 2050, this becomes \nincreasingly relevant. The classification system for 'green' and \n'sustainable' economic activities under the sustainable finance \ntaxonomy should provide an additional layer of protection.\n\nBox 6.6  Further deployment of current hydrogen \nsolutions for electricity storage could \nincrease total water consumption\n\nAccording to the European Commission's hydrogen \nstrategy for a climate-neutral Europe (EC, 2020e), \nincreased production of hydrogen could account for \nup to 16-20\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\tEU\tenergy\tproduction.\tHydrogen\t\ncould be used to store surplus production of electricity, \nand then convert it back to hydrogen gas, which could be \nused in combustion engines generating kinetic power and \nwater. It could be applied in various sectors, but mostly \nin transport and industry. However, further deployment \nof current hydrogen solutions could increase water \nconsumption\tin\tthe\tenergy\tsector\tby\tmore\tthan\t30\u00a0%.\n\nSources: Magagna et al.

(2020).\n\n6.6.6 Forging a climate-resilient Europe: the new EU \nstrategy on adaptation to climate change\n\nThe EU climate change adaptation strategy from 2021 aims to \nrealise the 2050 vision of a climate-resilient Union, by making \nadaptation smarter, more systemic and swifter and by stepping \nup international action. It recognises that adaptation policy \nhas a systemic nature, and it calls for adaptation action to be \nimplemented 'in an integrated manner with other European \nGreen Deal initiatives' (EC, 2021a). It aims to build on and \n\nexpand the achievements of the 2013 strategy regarding \nthe mainstreaming of adaptation into EU policies and the \nincorporation of climate risk into decision-making (EC, 2021). This \nrepresents an opportunity to build on the synergies between \nwater stress policies and climate adaptation strategies, which \naccording to recent assessments are not fully exploited at \nMember State and river basin levels (Buchanan et al., 2019). \nFurthermore, Member States not yet facing water stress are \nnot taking sufficient action to address future threats as a result \nof climate change (Buchanan et al., 2019). As climate change \nprogresses, the intersection between adaptation measures, \nwater and agriculture will gain relevance. On the basis of the \nexpected changes in growing seasons and suitable crops \nacross different European regions, economic integration and \ncoordinated economic planning will be crucial to ensure the \nresilience of the EU economy. The collection of climate-related \ndata, the enhancement of their usability, and the transfer \nof knowledge and technology will also be fundamental, and \ndigitalisation could play a facilitating role in all of these. Here, \nonce more, the lessons learned from the energy sector in setting \nup the Just Transition Mechanism could prove useful in keeping \nup with the pace of environmental change.\n\n6.7 The role of EU innovation policy in reducing \nwater stress\n\nOver the last two decades, the European Commission has laid \nthe foundations for EU innovation policy and taken action to \ngenerate the necessary conditions for innovation to flourish in \nthe region (European Parliament, 2020). Financially underpinned \nby the Horizon 2020 programme, the innovation union policy \ninitiative set out to secure Europe's global competitiveness (EC, \n2015e). The refreshed goals for EU research and innovation \npolicy, the three 'O's \u2014 open innovation, open science, open to \nthe world \u2014 further reinforced this vision (EC, 2021c). Over time, \nthese policies have supported numerous research, development, \ninnovation and demonstration projects on climate change \nadaptation, environmental protection and resource efficiency. \nThey have also enabled the creation and operation of various \ninitiatives and partnerships that foster innovation in Europe, \nincluding in the area of water and the environment: European \ninnovation partnerships (EIPs) (e.g. EIP-Water, EIP-Agriculture); \njoint efforts by the European Institute of Innovation and \nTechnology's innovation hubs (e.g. the project Water Scarcity in \nSouth); joint programming initiatives (e.g. JPI Water, JPI Climate, \nJPI FACCE (Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change), JPI \nOceans); joint technology initiatives and European technology \nplatforms (e.g. WaterEurope, formerly WssTP). Furthermore, \nEuropean research organisations on water have teamed up to \ncreate thematic fora (e.g. EurAqua).\n\nSecuring Europe's leadership in scientific excellence and \ninnovation as a way to stimulate its economy, boost climate \naction and promote sustainable development continues \nto be a priority for the European Commission, as set out in \nthe reflection paper Towards a sustainable Europe by 2030 \n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n104 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n(EC,\u00a02019g)\tand\tmanifested\tin\tthe\tEuropean\tGreen\tDeal\t\n(EC,\u00a02019e).\tAs\tregards\twater\tstress\tand\tclimate\tresilience,\t\nthe new EU strategy on climate change adaptation and the \nmission on adaptation, which informs the new Horizon Europe \nprogramme, depend heavily on innovation to generate \nregion-specific portfolios of solutions to be demonstrated \nin a large number of European communities and regions \n(EC, 2020a). A good proportion of such solutions could be \ndeveloped by small and medium-sized enterprises capable \nof exploiting the capacity generated by Copernicus \u2014the \nEU's\u00a0Earth\tobservation\tprogramme\t\u2014\tand\tother\tsources,\twhich\t\nwould thereby seize a share of the value of the data economy \nenvisaged in the updated EU digital strategy (EC, 2020i).\n\nIn the field of water, European research and innovation is \ncurrently focusing on a wide range of topics (see Annex 1 for \nselected EU projects related to water stress management). The \naspects most relevant to the topics of water quantity and water \nstress are:\n\n\u2022 better monitoring of the Earth and its climate and of water \nuses (e.g. satellite technology, remote sensing, unstaffed \naerial vehicles, citizen observatories and information \ncrowdsourcing, digitalisation of the water sector);\n\n\u2022 better data management and analysis (e.g. internet of \nthings, big data science, machine learning, geographical \ninformation systems, advanced information and \n\ncommunication technologies, integrated data visualisation \nand decision support platforms);\n\n\u2022 better socio-environmental modelling and forecasting \n(e.g. near-real-time modelling and forecasting of natural \nphenomena including hydrological and drought forecasting, \nagent-based modelling of coupled socio-environmental \nsystems, elicitation of social attitudes through serious gaming);\n\n\u2022 better technologies for increasing technical water efficiency \n(e.g. leakage detection and control in water networks, \nprecision agriculture technologies, industrial symbiosis);\n\n\u2022 better tools for raising awareness and controlling water \nuse (e.g. mobile applications promoting awareness of and \nbehavioural change towards water use, schemes on water \nfootprinting of processes and products) (Box 6.7);\n\n\u2022 better technologies for enabling and promoting water \nsupply from alternative water sources (e.g. more \nenergy-efficient desalination and water reuse with minimal \nenvironmental risks, real-time monitoring of water quality \nparameters for safe water reuse, cost-efficient and safe \nwater recovery from effluent from processing industries);\n\n\u2022 better technologies for managed aquifer recharge.\n\nBox 6.7 Berlin uses augmented reality to foster citizen engagement in urban groundwater management\n\nSince 2000, Germany has registered 9 of its 10 warmest years on record. This is considered an unusual accumulation \nof record years of high temperatures (Helmholtz-Klima-Initiative, 2020). In 2019, the neighbouring states of Berlin and \nBrandenburg were ranked the two warmest German L\u00e4nder (Berlin.de, 2020). Furthermore, according to scenarios informing \nits climate adaptation programme, the city of Berlin expects to have a Mediterranean climate by the year 2100, similar to \nthat of present-day Toulouse (Reusswig et al., 2016). In this context, the prospects of decreased precipitation and variations \nin seasonality are bringing water resource challenges onto the German capital's agenda and, with this, a need for increased \ncitizen awareness of the origin and management of their water resources.\n\nManaged aquifer recharge, using the natural aquifer for treatment and storage, is the main process Berlin uses for \ndrinking water production.\n\nSince 2019, the Digital Water City project (Digital Water City, 2021) is set to (1) raise public awareness of Berlin's water \nresources; (2) increase acceptance of policies promoting the sustainable use of urban water, and (3) foster public involvement \nin\turban\twater\tmanagement.\tTo\tdo\tso,\tthe\tproject\tis\tdeveloping\tan\taugmented\treality\tmobile\tapplication\u00a0(21) providing \nits users with an immersive view into a 'hidden part' of the water cycle.

Alternatively, they may develop single international \nRBMPs, in which they should also involve non-EU countries that \nshare a river basin with them. These are used less frequently, \nthough. In Europe, there are nine cases of international river \nbasins with active international agreements, established \ninternational coordinating bodies and international RBMPs in \nplace: Danube, Elbe, Ems, Meuse, Odra, Rhine, Sava, Scheldt \nand Teno/Tana (see Box 6.8 and 6.9). In other international \nriver basins, a single international RBMP or an international \ncoordinating body may be missing. However, cases where no \ninternational agreement has been signed are rare (EC, 2019c).\n\nA review (EC, 2019c) of the above cases reveals that water stress \nis not highlighted as a significant issue requiring international \ncooperation in most of them. Thus, the issues of overabstraction, \nwater scarcity and droughts do not receive sufficient attention. \nThe focus of international cooperation is commonly on water \nquality issues, hydromorphology or flooding.\n\nBox 6.8 Examples of international cooperation in water stress management\n\nDanube: the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River strategy on adaptation to climate change, \ndeveloped in 2012 and updated in 2018, providing guidance on the definition of adaptation measures, such as restoring \nwater retention areas and addressing water scarcity and drought risks.\n\nElbe: climate change outlooks considered in the economic analysis of water use in the long term.\n\nEms: assessment of future climate change impacts; climate-proofing of measures considering their sensitivity to climate \nchange\timpacts\tunder\tdifferent\u00a0scenarios.\n\nMeuse: joint status assessment of transboundary groundwater bodies; ongoing work on a joint report on water scarcity \nthat will support the development of an updated framework for managing low-flow events (for the current framework see \nBox 6.1); ongoing work programme to increase information exchange on national and international activities related to \nclimate change assessment and adaptation.\n\nRhine: International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine strategy for adapting to climate change, developed in 2015, \nconsidering climate change impacts, the discharge regime of the river, prolonged periods of low flow and frequency of \nflood events under different scenarios; definition of the basic principles of selecting adaptation measures.\n\nScheldt: initial exploratory climate memorandum signed, including droughts aspects, such as a discussion on possible \nrestrictions on water abstraction.\n\n(22) North Sea, Northern Periphery and Arctic, Baltic Sea, Danube, Alpine Space and Mediterranean.\n\nConsideration of climate change and cooperation on climate \nchange adaptation (CCA) at international level has also \nstrengthened in Europe over the last decade (Ramieri et al., 2018). \nThe EU climate adaptation strategy, launched in 2013, included \nreferences to cross-border issues. Furthermore, the evaluation \nconducted by the European Commission in 2018 showed that the \nstrategy promoted several cross-border actions on climate risks \nbetween Member States (EC, 2018b). Transnational strategies or \naction\tplans\ton\tCCA\thave\tbeen\tdeveloped\tin\tmany\tregions\u00a0(22), \nincluding the Mediterranean, the Danube, the Alps and the Baltic. \nExisting international conventions (e.g. OSPAR Convention on \nthe protection of the North-East Atlantic, Barcelona Convention \non the protection of the coastal region of the Mediterranean) \nhave also catalysed the transnational dialogue and cooperation \non CCA issues. Moreover, web-based adaptation platforms, \nknowledge centres and networks have been set up, and \ntransnational CCA-related projects are being implemented. \nHowever, CCA-related projects are more focused on knowledge \ncreation and dissemination, awareness-raising, capacity-building, \nnetworking and cross-country exchange, and less focused on \nactual implementation of joint measures. Interreg programmes \nhave provided significant support to transnational cooperation \non CCA (Figure 6.4) (Ramieri et al., 2018). The new EU strategy on \nadaptation to climate change calls for more ambitious and more \nproactive EU-level action on climate adaptation, both domestically \nand internationally (EC, 2021a).\n\f\nSustainable solutions for water stress management in\u00a0Europe \n\n106 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n6.9 Prospects for solutions\n\nThe search for solutions to the increasing impacts of \nwater stress can take roughly four directions, each with its \npreferred\u00a0applications:\n\n1. Continue and intensify the development of technologies for \nmeasures to address sectoral water demand and for saving \nwater in households, agriculture, industry and electricity \nproduction. This is considered a no-regret option. In the \nlonger term it will become necessary in most parts of the \nEU, and in the short term it offers environmental gains.\n\n2. Intensify the development of nexus approaches, capitalising \non synergies between economic sectors, including NbS.\n\n3. Continue and intensify the pursuit of additional means \nof water supply in areas with coastal tourism, high-value \nagricultural and horticultural areas near coasts, and \n\nurbanised areas. In this context, inter-basin water transfers \nare considered a last resort because of their serious \nenvironmental impacts. The use of this measure should be \nrestricted to cases of genuine necessity and, where possible, \ncombined with NbS.\n\n4. Continued systemic change aimed at addressing the root \ncauses of overexploitation of natural resources, as part of a \nmuch broader transformation than of water management \nalone, following one of IPBES's conclusions (IPBES, 2019): \n'Goals for conserving and sustainably using nature \nand achieving sustainability cannot be met by current \ntrajectories, and goals for 2030 and beyond may only be \nachieved through transformative changes.'\n\nThe most likely outcome seems to be a mixture of site- and \ncase-specific combinations of the first three approaches, while \nthe fourth option offers an alternative pathway \u2014 maybe \nto be explored first in areas where current practices can no \n\nFigure\t6.4\t Available\tfunds\tfor\tInterreg\u00a0V\u00a0B\t2014\u20112020\tprogrammes\trelated\tto\tclimate\tchange\tadaptation\t(CCA)\t\nand disaster risk reduction (DRR) in vaious regions of Europe\n\nSource: Ramieri et al.

The iRBD covers an area of almost 35\u00a0000\u00a0km\u00b2,\twith\tclose\tto\t9\u00a0million\t\ninhabitants.\tThe\tlength\tof\tthe\triver\tis\t905\u00a0km.\n\nUrbanisation, industrialisation, agriculture and navigation affect the status of the waters of the iRBD Meuse. The Meuse \nis\tthe\tsource\tof\tdrinking\twater\tfor\talmost\t7\u00a0million\tpeople.\tNavigation\tis\tof\tparticular\tinterest\tin\tthe\tarea,\tboth\tin\tBelgium\t\n(Flanders) and in the Netherlands. Over the past two centuries an intricate network of shipping canals has been developed \nthat depends entirely on the Meuse for its water supply.\n\nThe\testimated\twater\texploitation\tindex\tplus\t(WEI+)\tof\tthe\tMeuse\tis\tabout\t30\u00a0%\ton\taverage.\tThis\tmakes\tthe\tiRBD\tstand\tout\t\nas one of the more water stressed in western Europe (see Map 5.1).\n\nIn 1995, after long negotiations, the issue of the distribution of available water during low-flow periods resulted in the Meuse \ndischarge convention between Belgium (Flanders) and the Netherlands. The guiding principle of the Meuse discharge convention \nis to secure equal rights to use water for economic purposes for both countries and to accept joint responsibility for the stretch \nof the Meuse that marks the international border. In this stretch, low discharges can be harmful to the valuable ecology.\n\nSimultaneously, in 1995, France, Belgium (Wallonia, Brussels Capital Region, Flanders) and the Netherlands reached \nagreement on a wider, multilateral convention on the protection of the Meuse. This convention was succeeded in 2002 \nby the International Meuse Commission (IMC) upon the signature of the Meuse Convention (Treaty of Ghent, which \nnow includes Germany and Luxembourg). The purpose of the convention is to achieve sustainable and integrated water \nmanagement of the Meuse iRBD.\n\nThe Meuse discharge convention stipulates that both Belgium (Flanders) and the Netherlands take measures to limit their \nwater use during times of water shortage. In the Netherlands this mainly involves pumping back water to the upstream \nstretches at the ship locks. The passage of ships through locks is also performed in a 'water-economical' manner, using \nwater-saving devices. If this is not sufficient, the water allowances of other water-using sectors are cut back, according to \nthe order described in the national priority sequence. Flanders limits its water use by installing pumps at the ship locks. A \nconsiderable part of the water intended for Flanders is used for these ship locks. When one of the parties at some point \nfinds it difficult to meet the conditions of the treaty, it is jointly considered whether that party may temporarily use more \nwater. The associated costs are settled afterwards (Bastings et al., 2011).\n\nLessons learned from the Meuse Convention (Mostert, 1999; Bastings et al., 2011);\n\n\u2022 Conventions are a matter of mutual trust. In the Meuse it took a long time to overcome historical disputes between \nBelgium and the Netherlands and build such trust.\n\n\u2022 Linking different issues can result in a package deal that is attractive to all parties. In the case of the Meuse, \nbreakthroughs were reached after linking water quantity in the Meuse with seaport accessibility in the Scheldt.\n\n\u2022 To arrive at an attractive package deal, a cross-sectoral approach is often instrumental.\n\nThe 2018 drought again demonstrated the vulnerability of the Meuse basin to water shortages. The Dutch evaluation of the \n2018 drought includes specific actions to reinforce dialogue with Germany and France on drought and low flows (Ministerie \nvan Infrastructuur en Waterstaat, 2019).\n\nlonger be continued. Whichever approach is chosen, it will \nbe fully dependent on and must therefore be interconnected \nwith economic and legal measures and measures to increase \npublic awareness. What counts is the (public's) awareness that \ncontinuing current practices is no longer possible in hotspots, \nand that there are areas that are likely to become additional \nhotspots in the coming decades.\n\nOne benefit of the gradual nature of the progress of water \nstress problems is that it leaves some time to develop new \n\npractices and exchange lessons learned across the EU. \nImplementing measures to address water demand will buy \nsome more time \u2014 provided lock-ins are avoided. Long-term \nplanning may include methods such as adaptive planning and \npathways that view short-term measures through a long-term \nperspective, to take a long-term view and to avoid additional \nlock-ins as much as possible.\n\f\n\u00a9 St\u00e9phane Isoard\n\f\n109Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\n7 \nConclusions\n\nWater stress can be caused by natural phenomena (drought \nevents), by phenomena arising from human activities \n(unsustainable water abstraction, deterioration of water quality, \nlack of access to water) or by a combination (climate change). \nClimate change is manifesting itself with increasing impact. It is \nexpected to cause a major increase in the occurrence of water \nstress, affecting an increasing area of the EU and an increasing \npercentage of its inhabitants annually. Water stress caused \nby overabstraction is persistent, but this report presents clear \nevidence that the efforts made to reduce it are having an effect.\n\nWater stress caused by overabstraction is often a local and \ntemporary phenomenon, predominantly occurring in urban \nareas, irrigated agricultural areas and tourist hotspots in the \nsummer months. Such areas tend to have high economic value \nand considerable vulnerability to water stress. The impacts of \noverabstraction in such areas can be aggravated by droughts. \nThe impacts are aggravated even more by the continuing trend \ntowards concentrating the population and economic activities in \nurban areas.\n\nEvidence is growing that water is being used in the EU with \nincreasing efficiency. The economic sectors that depend most on \nwater availability are agriculture, electricity production, industry \nand drinking water supply. Comparing the water consumption \nand net value added of agriculture, electricity production and \nindustry clearly indicates a trend towards increasing efficiency \nof water use, albeit not always consistently in the time span for \nwhich data are available (1995-2017) or among the four regions \nof Europe (eastern, northern, western and southern).\n\nCare must be taken that this gain does not only reinforce \neconomic growth (and associated water demands) but instead \nbenefits the environment. One way of securing this is by \nincorporating ecological flows in river basin management \nplans and drought management plans. The analysis of sectoral \nwater use and outlooks in this report signals that ecological \nflows have not yet been well defined in most of the river basin \nmanagement plans.\n\nThe agricultural, electricity production and industry sectors may \nhave\tpotential\tfor\tfurther\twater\tsavings\tin\tthe\torder\tof\t20-40\u00a0%;\t\n\nan updated assessment of this potential is needed. Where \ndemand management alone is not sufficient, alternative water \nsupply methods, such as waste water reuse and desalination, \nmay offer perspectives at the local scale. This report has not \naddressed the costs and benefits of these measures.\n\nPolicy responses at EU level that address or touch on water \nstress form an intricate network. The Water Framework \nDirective is at the centre of this network. Distinct progress is \nbeing made in its implementation, while additional efforts are \nneeded in monitoring, modelling and licensing of abstractions. \nIntertwined are sectoral policies and emerging integrated \ninitiatives. Our analysis suggests that 'anchoring' water \nmanagement objectives in sectoral policies is a prerequisite \nfor successful water stress management. The European Green \nDeal and the new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change \nhave great potential to leverage policy integration and increase \nEurope's climate preparedness and resilience.\n\nTo demonstrate the impacts of past and future water stress \nevents, the evidence needs to be available and presented at \nsufficient temporal and geographical detail. This level of detail \nis not always present in the data currently reported by the \nMember States to the European Commission and the EEA.\n\nInsufficient quality or coverage of data is a persistent and \nrecurrent issue in water management in general, and also in \nwater stress management. Emerging technological innovations \noffer promising perspectives for detailed (in both time and \nspace) observations of such issues as snow cover, soil moisture, \nactual evapotranspiration and unauthorised abstraction. For \ndata collection that depends on the cooperation of stakeholders \n(e.g. in the industry) collaboration must be intensified and the \nlessons learned expanded to other sectors.\n\nIn the parts of Europe where water stress problems need \nurgent action, the challenge is to avoid continued lock-in to \ntechnical solutions, such as water transfers, and instead start off \nwith an analysis that includes the root causes of the problem, \nusing nexus approaches and systemic analysis. Ecosystem \napproaches and nature-based solutions are measures readily \nassociated with such approaches.\n\f\n\u00a9 Seyran Kartal, Climate Change PIX /EEA\n\f\f\nWater resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment112\n\nAbbreviations\n\n8th EAP Eighth Environment Action \nProgramme\n\nCAP Common agricultural policy \n\nCCA Climate change adaptation \n\nCIS Common implementation strategy\n\nCSI Core Set of Indicators (EEA's \nindicators system) \n\nDMP Drought management plan\n\nEEA European Environment Agency\n\nEEA-38 and the UK The 32 member countries and six \ncooperating countries of the EEA and \nthe United Kingdom\n\nEIP European innovation partnership\n\nE-OBS Daily gridded observational data set \nunder the Ensembles project \n\nETC/ICM European Topic Centre on Inland, \nCoastal and Marine Waters \n\nEU European Union\n\nEU-27 The 27 Member States of the \nEuropean Union\n\nEU-27 and the UK The 27 Member States of the \nEuropean Union and the United \nKingdom\n\nFP7 Framework Programme 7 (funding \nprogramme)\n\nH2020 Horizon 2020 (funding programme)\n\nInterreg EU Instrument supporting cooperation \nacross borders through \nproject\u00a0funding\n\nIPBES Intergovernmental Science-Policy \nPlatform on Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services\n\nIPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange\n\nJPI Joint Programming Initiative\n\nJRC Joint Research Centre\n\nMAES Mapping and assessment of \necosystems and their services\n\nNbS Nature-based solutions\n\nNGO Nongovernmental organisation\n\nNUTS Nomenclature of Territorial Units \nfor Statistics (Eurostat's geocode \nstandard) \n\nNVA Net value added\n\nPeseta Projection of economic impacts of \nclimate change in sectors of the \nEuropean Union based on bottom-up \nanalysis\n\nRBD River basin district\n\nRBMP River basin management plan\n\nRCP Representative Concentration \nPathway\n\nRDP Rural development programme\n\nSDG Sustainable Development Goal\n\nSPI Standardised precipitation index\n\nUN United Nations \n\nWEFE nexus Water, energy, food, ecosystem nexus\n\nWEI Water exploitation index\n\nWEI+ Water exploitation index plus\n\nWFD Water Framework Directive\n\nWG Working Group\n\nWISE Water Information System for Europe\n\f\n113Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment \n\nReferences\n\nAllam, M.

The project also explored the \npotential to improve river basin management through the integration of ecosystems \nservices in freshwater policies and management.\n\nEartH2Observe\nGlobal Earth observation for \nintegrated water resource \nassessment\n\n(FP7, 2014-2017)\n\nEartH2Observe aimed to integrate available global Earth observations via satellites and \nin situ data from ground stations with global hydrological and land surface models to \nperform a re-analysis and generate a comprehensive and consistent data set for global \nwater resources. The project reconstructed time series of sufficient length (several \ndecades) for key components of the water cycle, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, \nsoil moisture, groundwater and others. Therefore, it improved our knowledge of water \nbudgets, especially in regions with gaps in their monitoring coverage. A key product of \nthe project was the Water Cycle Integrator data portal, which provides all data sets online. \nThe usefulness of the project outputs was demonstrated in selected case studies with the \nparticipation of local stakeholders.\n\nDestinE\nDestination Earth\n(European Commission, 20212030)\n\nThe ambition of the Destination Earth initiative is to create digital replicas of different \nsubsystems of the Earth (e.g. weather and climate, global ocean circulation and \nbiogeochemistry of the oceans, freshwater, food) and integrate them into a unique 'digital \ntwin' of the Earth. This digital twin will contain high-precision information on the status and \noperation of the physical world, including environmental and socio-economic activities, \nand it will be capable of simulating different scenarios for sustainable development. \nTherefore, it could improve policymaking and decision-making in the EU. The core feature \nof the project will be a federated cloud-based modelling and simulation platform, which \nwill provide access to advanced computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence applications \nand analytics, sophisticated software and data sets. It will be funded as part of the \nEuropean Commission's programme for Digital Europe, while certain aspects will also be \nsupported by Horizon Europe and the EU space programme. Although the initial end users \nare public authorities, the initiative will also provide opportunities for exploitation of the \nresults by scientific and industrial users in the future.\n\nHydrousa\nDemonstration of water loops \nwith innovative regenerative \nbusiness models for the \nMediterranean\u00a0region\n\n(H2020, 2018-2022)\n\nHydrousa focuses on the development of a circular business model for the \nMediterranean and other water-scarce regions across Europe and worldwide, by \nestablishing decentralised regenerative solutions for water/waste water treatment and \nmanagement that close the local water loops, improve agricultural production and \nbenefit local value chains. The project devises and demonstrates innovative solutions \nwith low-energy footprints for different types of water (i.e. rainwater, groundwater, \nwaste water, saline water and vapour). Proposed solutions adopt traditional handcraft \nand ancient technologies and combine them with modern nature-based and natureinspired approaches, as well as with information and communication technology systems \nand\u00a0automation.\n\nhttp://www.globaqua-project.eu/en/home/\f\nAnnex 1  Recent EU innovation projects for water stress management\n\n126 Water resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\niWAYS\nInnovative water recovery \nsolutions through recycling of \nheat, materials and water across \nmultiple sectors\n\n(H2020, 2020-2024)\n\niWAYS\tfocuses\ton\tthe\trecovery\tof\tenergy,\tmaterial\tand\twater\tfrom\tindustries\twith\tgaseous\t\nand waste water emissions by applying non-disruptive approaches that combine exhaust \ncondensation, water treatment and waste valorisation.

The key project output will be an integrated platform that serves \nas an early warning and decision support system. The platform will assist water utilities \nin mitigating risks, handling crisis events and alerting the public and the authorities on \nevolving issues with their water networks, thus reducing the potential for water shortages \nand improving response times in the event of crises.\n\nDigital Water.City\nLeading urban water management \nto its digital future\n\n(H2020, 2019-2022)\n\nDigital Water.City investigates a range of digital solutions that could be applied in \nurban and peri-urban environments to help the water authorities tackle modern water \nchallenges and increase citizens' awareness and participation in water protection and \nmanagement. The project demonstrates case studies from five major cities in Europe \n(i.e. Berlin, Copenhagen, Milan, Paris and Sofia). Inter alia, it develops digital solutions \nfor increasing the volume of safe water reuse, promoting precision farming, raising \nawareness of groundwater risks, and facilitating integrated monitoring and management \nof groundwater resources. A variety of methods and technologies is being combined and \ntested, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, unmanned aerial vehicles, realtime sensors, modelling, augmented reality, mobile technology and cloud computing. \nThe project also addresses the issues of interoperability, cybersecurity and governance \nregarding digital infrastructure.\n\nFiware4Water\nFiware for the next generation \nof internet services for the water \nsector\n\n(H2020, 2019-2022)\n\nFiware4Water builds upon the Fiware platform, which is an open-source smart solution \nincorporating modules that enable the connection of the internet of things, context \ninformation management, big data services and cloud services and facilitates smart city \ninitiatives and the next generation of internet initiative. The project aims to support the \nadoption of the Fiware platform by end users of the water sector (e.g. cities, water utilities, \nwater authorities, citizens and consumers) and solution providers (e.g. private utilities, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, developers), because of its capacity to enable \ninteroperability, standardisation, cross-domain cooperation and data exchange. The \nproject demonstrates four European case studies of digital water solutions for optimised \nselection of water sources and routing of water, increased water saving and safety in \nwater networks, real-time monitoring and awareness of household consumption, and \noptimisation of waste water treatment operation.\n\nNaiades\nA holistic water ecosystem for \ndigitisation of the urban water \nsector\n\n(2019-2022)\n\nNaiades focuses on real-time monitoring of water use in residential, commercial and \npublic buildings and the exploitation of big data analytics in three dimensions (i.e. spatial, \ntemporal and nodal). A mobile application has been developed to support consumers' \nawareness of and behavioural change towards their personal water use through a \nstepwise commitment to more sustainable water use goals. The project also measures the \nsafety and reliability of water supply after examining equipment failures and maintenance \nschemes, in order to understand and improve water asset management strategies by \nwater utilities. Furthermore, the project collects information on water quality and applies \nmachine learning techniques to predict potential quality problems before they arise, thus \nincreasing the confidence of consumers regarding the quality of their tap water.\n\nhttps://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/422582-new-technologies-to-slash-water-consumption-and-to-recover-30-of-water-and-heat-in-industry\f\f\f\nEuropean Environment Agency\n\nWater resources across Europe \u2014 confronting water stress: an updated assessment\n\n2021 \u2014 126 pp. \u2014 21 x 29.7 cm\n\nISBN 978-92-9480-391-7\ndoi: 10.2800/320975\n\nGetting in touch with the EU\n\nIn person\nAll\tover\tthe\tEuropean\tUnion\tthere\tare\thundreds\tof\tEurope\tDirect\tinformation\tcentres.\tYou\tcan\tfind\tthe\taddress\tof\tthe\tcentre\t\nnearest you at: https://europa.eu/european-union/contact_en\n\nOn the phone or by email\nEurope\tDirect\tis\ta\tservice\tthat\tanswers\tyour\tquestions\tabout\tthe\tEuropean\tUnion.\tYou\tcan\tcontact\tthis\tservice:\n\u2022 by freephone: 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11 (certain operators may charge for these calls),\n\u2022 at the following standard number: +32 22999696 or \n\u2022 by email via: https://europa.eu/european-union/contact_en\n\nFinding information about the EU\n\nOnline\nInformation about the European Union in all the official languages of the EU is available on the Europa website at:  \nhttps://europa.eu/european-union/index_en\n\nEU publications \nYou\tcan\tdownload\tor\torder\tfree\tand\tpriced\tEU\tpublications\tat:\thttps://publications.europa.eu/en/publications.  \nMultiple copies of free publications may be obtained by contacting Europe Direct or your local information centre  \n(see\u00a0https://europa.eu/european-union/contact_en).\n\nhttps://europa.eu/european\u2011union/contact_en\f\nTH-AL-21-011-EN-N\ndoi:10.2800/320975\n\nEuropean Environment Agency\nKongens Nytorv 6\n1050 Copenhagen K\nDenmark\nTel.: +45 33 36 71 00\nWeb: eea.europa.eu\nEnquiries: eea.europa.eu/enquiries\n\nhttp://eea.europa.eu", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Clean water comes out of a tap, we use the water and then \u2018dirty\u2019 water disappears down the drain. In this way, the water that leaves our homes, schools and workplaces is contaminated. For most European citizens, such waste water is collected, transported and then treated at an urban waste water treatment plant, to remove components harmful to the environment and human health, before the water is returned to nature (EEA, 2018). The importance of access to clean water and sanitation is embedded in Goal 6 of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (UN, n.d). Supplying clean water and collecting waste water has required huge investment across Europe in recent decades. In this briefing, we show that challenges to securing sustainable water in future, such as climate change, present new opportunities for resource efficiency and improved environmental protection.\nFor most European citizens, sewage from our toilets, sinks and washing machines goes down pipes to be treated, reducing disease-causing organisms and the nutrient load that would otherwise cause pollution and the proliferation of algae.\nWaste water from households and industry creates significant pressure on the aquatic environment because of the loads of organic matter and nutrients it contains. If released into waterways, ammonia and natural processes break down organic matter in the water but can use up the oxygen, making the river uninhabitable for fish and invertebrates. Meanwhile, excess nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can cause plants and algae to grow excessively, cutting out light and using up the oxygen in the water through respiration or when the plants decay (Picture 1). The widespread introduction of effective waste water treatment during the 20th century has greatly improved human health and environmental quality.\nImage \u00a9 Caroline Whalley\nThe proportion of households connected to waste water treatment facilities varies across Europe. In western-central Europe, for example, the connection rate is 97 %. In southern, south-eastern and eastern European countries, it is generally lower, although it has increased over the last 10 years to reach about 70 % (EEA, 2017a). Despite these significant improvements in recent years, around 30 million people are still not connected to waste water treatment plants in Europe. In areas where people live far apart, it may be more practical to use individual treatment methods like septic tanks to deal with sewage.\nSewers need to be built to collect sewage and transport it to a waste water treatment plant. There, differing levels of treatment can be applied and usually include:\nMore information about treatment types in specific urban waste water treatment plants is available: EEA urban waste water treatment maps\nSewage sludge, formed by bacteria as a result of the consumption of organic pollution, arises as a by-product of waste water treatment. A range of treatments allow the safe disposal of the sludge. Liming and aerobic or anaerobic digestion stabilise the sludge, avoiding odour and reducing pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic digestion reduces the amount of sludge and produces biogas, while dewatering removes excess water, decreasing the weight and reducing transportation costs.\nDifferent disposal routes exist, depending mostly on national regulatory frameworks and sludge quality. Approximately half the sewage sludge produced by EU Member States is spread on land as fertiliser and a quarter is incinerated (Eureau, 2017). Sludge can contain high concentrations of metals, pathogens and persistent trace organic pollutants, so its use on land may be restricted to protect the environment.\nPast decades have seen billions of euros invested across Europe in the collection and treatment of urban waste water to remove harmful microorganisms, oxygen-consuming substances and nutrients (EC, 2017). This investment means that most Europeans no longer need to worry about the quality of their drinking water or local waterways (EEA, 2016, 2017b). However, our understanding of the challenges faced by urban waste water treatment has improved, for instance, in our knowledge of climate change and of the presence of hazardous substances. As we address these, we can use the opportunity to implement more sustainable solutions (Fig 1).\nSource: EEA\nIn some areas, climate change means heavy rainfall will be more frequent. In urban areas \u2014 where rainwater drains into the sewers carrying domestic sewage and industrial waste water (so-called \u2018combined sewers\u2019) \u2014 the rain enters the combined sewer network faster than it was designed for. This can cause overloading of the sewer network, leading to surface water flooding and overflow at urban waste water treatment plants, with untreated sewage flowing into rivers, lakes or coastal areas. Sustainable urban drainage systems can provide a solution, as they are designed to manage runoff in a sustainable way.\nIn other areas, climate change will lead to reduced rainfall. As a first step, improving water efficiency to reduce unnecessary use can conserve both water and the energy used in its transport and treatment. However, waste water treatment itself can play an important role in increasing the water availability. High level treatment can remove pollutants, so that the treated water can be reused. The EU is, in 2019, preparing a regulation on the reuse of urban waste water for agricultural irrigation.\nThe challenge\nSolutions implemented by countries\nStorm water management: adapting to climate change\nWaste water treatment plants in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, discharge to coastal areas. An open storm water system designed to accommodate a 15-year rainfall event includes 6 km of canals and water channels, 10 retention ponds, 30 green roofs and a botanical roof garden on an old, industrial roof. Rainfall is collected in natural ditches and reservoirs before being directed into a conventional sewer system. The system is integrated within green spaces that can be temporarily flooded to help manage water by slowing its entry into the conventional storm water system. This system avoids energy use by diverting storm water away from collection systems and waste water treatment.\nSeasonal increases in population and water scarcity\nIn Malta, the Ta\u2019Bakrat urban waste water treatment plant serves 434 000 population equivalent (p.e.), treating approximately 80 % of all waste water in Malta. It is subject to particular pressures during the tourist season. Investment in treatment technology helps address the issue of water scarcity, as the installation aims to provide 7 billion litres of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge each year. New treatment construction costs EUR 20 million, with a further EUR 20 million invested in irrigation infrastructure.\nIn urban areas it can be a challenge to find space to install new treatment plants or upgrade existing ones. There can be public opposition to development near residential areas, owing to noise and odour concerns.\nIn rural areas, population densities, the nature of the ground and surface water characteristics are key to deciding the type of collection and treatment system needed. Individual treatment systems, like septic tanks, are often used, since investment in sewers and treatment is generally costly and may impact heavily on a few users. The treatment plant needs to be able to operate with low volumes of water. Moreover, it can be difficult to find suitably qualified personnel to operate the treatment plant.\nThe challenge\nSolutions implemented by countries\nSmall, rural area with seasonal increase in population\nThe Rowy treatment plant in Poland deals with urban waste water from 5 000 p.e in winter and three times as much in the summer. It discharges directly into the \u0141upawy river. With increasing numbers of tourists, the plant was upgraded to increase capacity and introduce more efficient technologies. It was rebuilt to operate in two modes: part operation in \u2018winter\u2019 mode when there is less waste water to process; and full operation in \u2018summer\u2019 mode to deal with higher quantities of waste water. The upgrade cost approximately \u20ac7.5 million, with energy savings recorded in the winter.\nIn recent years, efforts have been put in place to reduce the energy consumption of infrastructure. Many urban waste water treatment plants have invested in technologies to better control processes and use less electricity, with non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions decreasing by 20% between 2005 and 2017 (EEA, 2019a). The capture of biogas resulting from the processes and the implementation of anaerobic digestion can be used to support the plants\u2019 energy needs. Energy efficiency measures include the recovery of heat from waste water processes and the use of space to accommodate wind turbines and solar panels, providing renewable energy.\nThe challenge\nSolutions implemented by countries\nImproving resource and energy efficiency\nIn the Netherlands, the Amersfoort urban waste water treatment plant (315 000 p.e.), receives domestic and light industrial effluent. The treatment process comprises physical treatment, and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The final effluent is discharged to the River Eem. In 2016, Amersfoort was converted into a regional sludge processing hub for several waste water treatment plants in the area, supported by the EU LIFE programme (with EUR 10.5 million). It uses innovative technologies to recover phosphorus and nitrogen from sludge for commercial nutrient use, producing a fertiliser as well as biogas. It is 100 % energy self-sufficient and exports energy to power 600 city dwellings.\nIn some cases, where the receiving water is particularly sensitive, treated effluent must meet a very high standard. This is done, for instance to avoid nutrients that cause excessive algal growth when discharged into Nutrient Sensitive Areas under the Water Framework Directive; to kill pathogens if discharge is near bathing waters; upstream of drinking water abstraction; or in watercourses with European or international protection.\nThe challenge\nSolutions implemented by countries\nDischarge into sensitive area and provision for broader infrastructure\nThe Arad urban waste water treatment plant in Romania has a treatment capacity of 225 000 p.e. It discharges effluent into a highly sensitive stretch of the Mures River, designated a Special Protection Area for birds and a Nutrient Sensitive Area. Upgrades to seven treatment plants \u2014 co-financed by the EU Cohesion Fund \u2014 rehabilitated the plants, as well as reservoirs, water transmission pipes and the sewerage network. The waste water treatment plant upgrade cost EUR 18 million. This resulted in a significant reduction in the organic and nutrient pollution load entering the River Mures.\nProtection of drinking water aquifer\nThe Wulpen urban waste water treatment plant in Belgium has a capacity of 74 700 p.e. The aquifer of St-Andr\u00e9 needed to be protected from saline intrusion as a result of over-abstraction. The upgraded plant includes more stringent treatments to remove phosphorus and disinfect the effluent. The treated water is of superior quality \u2014 similar to that of drinking water \u2014 is free of micropollutants and pathogens, and is used to recharge the aquifer. The project cost EUR 6 million and was financed by the EU\u2019s 7th Framework Programme.\nIn recent years, concern has increased regarding the presence of many chemicals at low concentrations within the water environment. With so many different substances in use, many chemicals reach surface waters via urban waste water treatment plants applying traditional treatment methods. Research has shown that many of the chemicals in waste waters now arise from use in our homes and leaching from products, or are directly added in the case of cleaning products and excreted pharmaceuticals (UKWIR, 2018). Concern is growing over the presence of mixtures of chemicals in the environment \u2014 the so-called \u2018cocktail effect\u2019 \u2014 that may be impacting aquatic life (EEA, 2019b).\nAn example of a possible new concern is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which arises from the use of antimicrobials, such as antibiotics, in human and veterinary medicine. Use and excretion of antimicrobial agents has resulted in the evolution of resistant bacteria, viruses and microbes, which can cause disease and are now resisting medicinal treatment. As a consequence, it has become increasingly difficult to tackle certain infections (WHO, 2018). Urban waste water treatment plants could be transferring AMR genes to the environment, but currently there is very limited information on the pathways for AMR in the environment to reach humans and the significance of this (EEA, 2019c).\nContinued vigilance will be needed to tackle new issues for waste water treatment as they are identified.\nIn the EU, the main objective of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) and equivalent national legislation for non-EU countries, is to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges. This is achieved through the collection and treatment of waste water in settlements and areas of economic activity with a p.e. of more than 2 000. In most cases, the Directive sets out that waste water must be subject to secondary treatment but in catchments with particularly sensitive waters, more stringent waste water treatment may be required. Currently the European Commission is evaluating the Directive to see if works well and is adequate for current and newer issues.\nThe Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) established a framework for the protection of rivers, lakes, transitional waters (estuaries), coastal waters and ground water. It aims to ensure that all surface water bodies are at good chemical and ecological status, displaying minimal signs of impact from human development. Meeting the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is the baseline for water pollution coming from urban areas.\n|Symbol||Brief explanation|\n|Storm water management \u2014 adapting to climate change|\n|Resource and energy efficiency|\n|Operating in areas with seasonally high population|\n|Operating in water scarce regions|\n|Compliance with European legislation \u2014 discharging into sensitive waters|\n|Urban and rural waste treatment provision|\nEC, 2017, Ninth Report on the implementation status and the programmes for implementation (as required by Article 17) of Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste water treatment.
