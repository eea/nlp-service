Wherever possible, \nthis report reflects briefly on the immediate response to and \nlonger-term implications for cities of the coronavirus crisis in \neach of the eight urban environmental sustainability nexuses. \nHowever, the research for this report and the analysis of these \nnexuses was largely finalised before the coronavirus emerged \nin Europe. More research would be required to understand how \nthe responses to COVID-19 have evolved and what the outcomes \nof the post-pandemic recovery will be that will also affect cities' \nachievement of the nexus objectives presented in this report.\n\nWe know that cities have been at the forefront of the health \ncrisis from the very beginning, not only bearing the worst \nimpacts but also becoming essential actors in proactively \nand innovatively addressing the health emergency, as well as \ndealing with the wider social and economic ramifications. It is \nclear that city, national and EU budgets will come under strain \nas a result of the economic crisis, which may result in reduced \nbudgets for core environmental initiatives in the years ahead.\n\nAt the same time, many policies that have been implemented \nprimarily to deal with the health emergency will also have \nlong-term environmental and quality of life benefits (e.g. \nimproved active travel infrastructure, access to green \ninfrastructure). These policies will also improve urban resilience \nto shocks (e.g. extreme weather events). There is a growing \nmovement of cities in Europe actively committing to a green \nrecovery from the crisis \u2014 supported by initiatives at the EU \nlevel, such as the European Green Deal.\n\nAs regards cultural shifts, similar uncertainties exist. While \npeople may be more attuned to the importance of clean air \nand high-quality green spaces, we are also seeing, for example, \ngrowth in single-use plastics, and a renewed preference for \nthe use of private cars over public transport, which may have \nserious environmental consequences.\n\nWhat is clear is that, for most Europeans, the pandemic \nhas caused abrupt changes in daily routines that will have \nfar-reaching consequences for cities. For many urban dwellers, \n\nworking from home has become the new normal, video \nconferences have replaced face-to-face meetings (and related \nbusiness travel), online shopping is taking over from physical \nretail, and people are becoming better acquainted with their \nimmediate neighbourhoods and local green spaces.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is clearly a challenge of unprecedented \nproportions, while also offering a window of opportunity that \nmay accelerate sustainability transformations in cities. From \nthe perspectives of both research and practice, it is clear that \nthere is a long agenda of issues that will have to be tackled \nin the months and years ahead. These include, for example, \nwhat a green recovery looks like for different cities; the \nmeaning of urbanity and the appropriate mix of land uses; \nnew requirements for the design of the public realm and \ngreen spaces; opportunities and challenges presented by new \nmodes of transport; changes in urban functions (e.g. homes \nbecoming the hub of day-to-day life and office buildings being \nconverted to housing); the impact on local business and service \nproviders (e.g. less inner-city footfall); the role of technology and \ndigital futures; urban and regional production (e.g. food, clean \nenergy) and value chains; and considerations of new forms of \nurban\u00a0decisionmaking.\n\nWhile current efforts are rightly focused on tackling the \nimmediate challenges posed by the pandemic, it is important \nto swiftly put in place recovery pathways that align with wider \nsustainability objectives. The EU's ambition of climate neutrality \nby 2050 and its European Green Deal must stay on track, while \ncontinuing to recognise the profound societal changes we \nare\u00a0undergoing.\n\nMoving forward, it will be ever more important to ensure a fair \ntransition for all while rebuilding our economies sustainably. \nOne important legacy of this crisis is likely to be the realisation \nthat behaviours, institutions and even infrastructure can be \nchanged a lot faster than may have previously been assumed. \nWe are not as 'locked-in' to certain ways of doing things as we \nthought and, if needed, can radically transform how our cities \noperate and how we operate within them. This has important \nimplications for cities when it comes to the transformation \nof systems that will be required to tackle the climate and \necological crisis in the years to come.\n\f\n\u00a9 Grzegorz Piaskowski, My City/EEA\n\f\n9Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nExecutive summary\n\nBackground and approach\n\nThis report presents the results of research undertaken to \nsupport the preparation of the EEA report Urban sustainability \nin Europe \u2014 Avenues for change. It presents the detailed \nanalysis of eight urban environmental sustainability nexuses. \nThese examples were used to help understand the complexity \nof urban systems and explore how, in practice, using nexus \nanalysis could help identify existing challenges, potential \ntrade-offs, actions to achieve urban sustainability objectives \nand opportunities to move towards better coordinated and \nintegrated policy and action. The analysis is followed by \noverall findings and lessons in support of policy integration \nand\t\u00a0action.\tThis\treport\tis\talso\ta\tpart\tof\ta\tseries\tof\toutputs\t\nprepared by EEA as presented in Figure ES.1.\n\nThe European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 report \nemphasises the key role cities play in wider sustainability \ntransitions across Europe. Cities are hubs of creativity, \ninnovation and learning and have the capacity to effect \nsystemic changes across a range of critical environmental \nissues (EEA, 2019a). Cities concentrate people, jobs and \neconomic activity. However, this also means that they are \ndisproportionately affected by social challenges such as \nsegregation, poverty and inequality (EC, 2016a). \n\nVulnerabilities from climate change and other environmental \nstresses will also be felt most acutely in urban areas because \nof the higher densities of people and infrastructure and \nbecause of cities' dependence on their hinterlands for food, \nwater, energy and other resources (EEA, 2019a). The EEA's indepth analysis of drivers of change of relevance for Europe's \nenvironment and sustainability (EEA, 2020a) emphasised that \ncities have a primary role in pushing forward societal change \nby promoting the circulation of ideas and encouraging social \nand technological innovations, experiments and changes in \nvalues, lifestyles and approaches to governance. \n\nCities are therefore both places where systemic challenges \nmust be met and places of opportunity to address these \nchallenges. Of course, cities differ enormously in the \nchallenges they face and the tools they have available to \naddress them. Sharing concrete examples of the many \ndifferent expressions of urban sustainability can help to inspire \ncity governments, irrespective of their context, to recognise \nthat\tthere\tis\ta\ttransition\tpathway\tthat\tis\tright\tfor\u00a0them.\t\n\nUrban environmental sustainability: \na framework\n\nAlthough there is no single agreed definition of urban \nsustainability, or what a sustainable city might look like, there is \nbroad agreement on what contributes to urban sustainability. \nThis includes the need to address economic, social and \nenvironmental issues in an integrated way and to ensure that \ncities are inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. For the \nEEA, urban environmental sustainability means encouraging \nrevitalisation and transitions of urban areas and cities to improve \nliveability, promote innovation and reduce environmental \nimpacts while maximising economic and social co-benefits. \n\nUrban systems are inherently complex, as is the concept of \nurban environmental sustainability. To help understand the \nrange of factors that will influence the transition towards \nurban environmental sustainability, a conceptual framework \nfor urban environmental sustainability has been developed. \nThe framework is designed to help support assessment and \nanalysis. \n\nThe conceptual framework is based on four main components \n(see Figure ES.2). These are: \n\n\u2022 Lenses \u2014 a range of perspectives on urban environmental \nsustainability that represent priority issues or concerns \nreflecting the EEA's environmental remit and can be used to \nguide/focus assessment and analysis. \n\n\u2022 Context \u2014 the range of current and historical, physical, \nsocial and institutional characteristics that create and shape \nthe setting in which a specific city exists, develops and \nfunctions. Each city's context has a considerable influence \non the transition to urban environmental sustainability. \n\n\u2022 Enabling factors \u2014 relatively high-level forces that, based \non their level of availability, can facilitate (drivers) or hinder \n(barriers) the transition towards urban environmental \nsustainability. \n\n\u2022 Building blocks \u2014 key qualities that contribute to urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Depending on the context \nand enabling factors, different building blocks will be the \ninputs required to transition towards urban environmental \nsustainability. \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n10 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nFigure ES.1 The EEA's reports and outputs on urban environmental sustainability transitions being published in \n2020 and 2021\n\nSource: EEA.\n\nAssessment and reporting outputs\n\nMethod and context outputs\n\nTHE MAIN REPORT\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\nAvenues for change\n\nFlagship report on urban environmental\nsustainability setting out the EEA's conceptual\n\nframework and summary of analysis\nor urban nexuses and drivers\n\nThe Covid-19 briefing\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nOpportunities for challenging times\n\nAn initial overview of key impacts of \nthe pandemic on urban environmental \n\nsustainability, and lessons from how \ncities are responding\n\nThe methodology report\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nA stakeholder-led assessment process\n\nDescribes the stakeholder-led process of \ndeveloping and applying the knowledge\n\nbase and conceptual framework for\nurban environmental sustainability\n\nThe glossary\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nGlossary of key terms and concepts\n\nA glossary of key terms and concepts\n used in the EEA's work on urban \n\nenvironmetal sustainability\n\nThe nexus assessments\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\n Learning from nexus analysis\n\nAn assessment of eight urban \nsustainability nexuses to explore the \n\ncomplexity of urban systems and \nhighlight policy priorities\n\nThe drivers report\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\nWhat is driving cities\u2019 environmental change?\n\nExplores the factors driving urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions\nin selected cities. Provides lessons on \n\nenabling factors and barriers\n\nThe conceptual framework is intended to be applied in different \nways to support the analysis of cities from the perspective of \nenvironmental sustainability. It has been used to develop and \ninform the analysis of urban nexuses and research into drivers \nof and barriers to sustainability in cities that are summarised in \nthis report. \n\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, \ncost\u2011effective actions\n\nTo address systemic environmental challenges and \naccommodate a greater number of people in the coming \ndecades while improving the quality of life of their residents, \nEuropean cities must urgently shift towards a more integrated \napproach to policy and action. There is a need for cross-cutting \nstrategies to address key systems (e.g. energy, mobility) and \nsupport the transformation to a low-carbon and circular \n\neconomy. Nexus analysis provides a way of helping to \nunderstand complex systems and identify better coordinated \npolices and actions to support urban environmental \nsustainability. \n\nDrawing on the conceptual framework, literature review and \nstakeholder input, eight example nexuses were selected for \nassessment: \n\n\u2022 Climate resilience nexus \n\n\u2022 Quality of life nexus \n\n\u2022 Urban accessibility nexus \n\n\u2022 Environment and health nexus \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n11Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n\u2022 Food security nexus \n\n\u2022 Closing the loop nexus \n\n\u2022 Clean energy nexus \n\n\u2022 Sustainable buildings nexus. \n\nEach of the priority nexuses is framed around a nexus objective \n(e.g. clean energy, accessibility) and selected interacting policy \nareas. Measuring progress towards nexus objectives could \nbe achieved by either using existing overarching indicators or \nindices or creating new ones, for example an overall index of \nurban climate resilience, or by monitoring a range of outcomes \nassociated with achieving the nexus objective, for example, in \nthe case of climate resilience, measuring the change in flood \nrisk to urban communities. The nexus analyses presented \nin this report are intended to be illustrative and explore \nselected examples of interacting areas of policy and action. A \ncomprehensive compilation of potential nexus indicators has \nnot been completed; however, results of an initial overview of \npotentially relevant indicators for each nexus from EEA or other \nsources were presented. Where these are available, potential \nindicators for each key nexus issue are proposed (i.e. an overall \nindicator or indicator set related to the nexus objective), as are \nindicators for measuring nexus outcomes.\n\nThe urban nexus approach can help to identify opportunities to \ncoordinate policymaking and action. Policymaking and action \nare often developed in silos, addressing specific sectors or \nissues, with sometimes competing objectives. The urban nexus \napproach, through which two or more urban policy areas are \nconsidered together, can help identify synergies, co-benefits \nand trade-offs. In this way opportunities can be prioritised to \nachieve better coordinated and cost-effective policymaking and \naction. \n\nTo achieve sustainability transitions, policy needs to be \nintegrated vertically as well as horizontally. Cities often have \na degree of autonomy in their governance and so they can, \nto some extent, influence change independently. However, \ncities also have interrelationships and interdependencies at \ndifferent scales, including at the EU and national scales, as well \nas with neighbourhoods and communities. The nexus approach \nfocuses on the horizontal integration of policy within a city; \nhowever, it is also important to consider vertical integration of \npolicy between a city and other scales. \n\nThe priority urban nexuses analysed illustrate how \ninterconnected and complex urban systems are. They operate \nat different levels and interact in many ways. For example, \nmeeting the nexus objective of urban climate resilience relates \nto other nexus objectives, in particular quality of life, urban \naccessibility, environment and health, and food security. \nHowever, assessing the nexuses individually helps break down \nthe challenges into more manageable issues while also still \nconsidering their interconnectedness. \n\nOverall policy and governance implications\n\nLooking across the lessons emerging from the nexus \nanalysis, some overall policy and governance implications \nare\u00a0identified:\t\n\n\u2022 Cities are complex systems and a wide range of different \ntypes of actions are seen across the nexuses and can be \nlinked to high-level policy agendas (e.g. at the EU scale). \nHowever, the nexus analysis shows that in practice a \nrelatively small number of policy agendas can be identified \nthat may be key to achieving urban environmental \nsustainability. A total of 18 policy agendas were identified, \nfor example building adaptive capacity and reducing \nvulnerability to climate change; improving the quality \nof and access to public open space and creating or \nimproving green infrastructure and urban ecology; using \ndigital technology; and promoting participation and \nempowerment of stakeholders and citizens. \n\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to remain intertwined \nwith policymaking and actions across sectors and affect \nthe transition to urban environmental sustainability in the \nimmediate future and longer term. Although the overall \nimplications of COVID-19 on progress towards the nexus \nobjectives is unclear, many of the actions envisaged will be \ninfluenced by the response to and need to recover from \nthe pandemic. Cities may have an opportunity to take \nadvantage of the moment to implement a green recovery. \n\n\u2022 A lack of coordinated and integrated policy and action \ncan result in trade-offs. The analysis showed that nexuses \ninteract through thematic and hierarchical links, as \nwell as through specific actions and interventions. An \naction intended to help achieve one nexus objective can \nlead directly to trade-offs in the achievement of other \nnexus\u00a0objectives.\t\n\n\u2022 Some actions provide opportunities to deliver co-benefits \nsimultaneously across various urban sustainability \nobjectives in a cost-effective way. For example, developing \nand improving green infrastructure in cities can help \nto reduce flood risk and urban overheating (Climate \nresilience nexus), reduce air and noise pollution and \nencourage active travel (Environment and health nexus), \nand improve people's satisfaction with their surroundings \n(Quality\tof\tlife\u00a0nexus).\t\n\n\u2022 Cities are well-placed to be leaders in delivering the \ntransition to a low-carbon sustainable economy and have \na pivotal role in achieving related EU policy objectives. For \nmost of the policy areas across the nexuses, cities can \ndesign, resource and implement sector-specific policy \nand actions without necessarily requiring the reform of \nthe policymaking process at national and/or EU scales. \nHowever, EU and national governments also have an \nimportant role in ensuring complementarity between \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n12 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\npolicy at different scales and in helping cities to overcome \nchallenges to achieving the nexus objectives. \n\n\u2022 Achieving urban sustainability will require new governance \napproaches. Such approaches could include systematic \nidentification of conflicts and barriers across policy sectors; \nhorizontal and vertical integration and coordination of \nmeasures; empowerment of all residents and enabling \nthem to have a greater say in urban decision-making. \n\n\u2022 Citizens and communities are fundamental to help cities \nreach their urban sustainability objectives. People are a \nfundamental part of the various systems (food, energy, \ntransport, etc.); thus to be truly effective, equitable action \nand collaboration must be central to any policy responses. \n\n\u2022 The nexus analysis could make use of composite indicators. \nThe nexus analysis shows that there is a limited number \nof such indicators available that could support nexus \nassessment. This contrasts with the abundance of \nquantitative contextual indicators focusing on a single topic. \n\n\u2022 The nexus analysis is a useful approach to improve urban \npolicy integration. Applying this approach encourages \n\ncommunication and coordination and can help \ndecision-makers to identify key actions to meet the \nselected urban sustainability objectives. Potential \nblind spots in decision-making processes can also be \nuncovered by highlighting potential trade-offs. The \nEEA conceptual framework for urban environmental \nsustainability is useful for decision-makers who need \nto identify key actions to meet the selected urban \nsustainability objectives. The lenses and building \nblocks that are embedded in the framework can help \nto identify the focus of analysis and provide a set of \nrelevant actions to contribute to urban environmental \nsustainability.\n\n\u2022 A number of research needs and opportunities were \nidentified, including applying the nexus approach at \ndifferent levels, such as within cities, and at national \nand European levels (using selected clusters of cities); \nusing cities to test and experiment with solutions to \ncomplex transition challenges, for example through EU \nand national research agendas; and developing new \nmeasures of progress towards urban sustainability, \nincluding composite indicators and measures \ncombining quantitative and qualitative evidence.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n13Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nCU\nLT\n\nURE \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGOVERNANCE  \n\n \n \n\nKNOW\nLEDGE \n\nTECH\nN\n\nOLOGY \n \n\n \n\n \nDATA AND INFORMATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFI\nN\n\nAN\nCE\n\n \n\nEnvironmental \nquality\n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nPublic \nopen space\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nEcological\nmulti\nfunctionality\n\nSustainable \nurban\n\n agriculture\n\nRenewable\nenergy\n\nLow energy\n consumption\n\nEnergy \nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial \n\nuse and zero \nwaste\n\nResource \nefficiency\n\nSustainable\nmobility\n\nGreen\neconomy\n\nBuilt \nenvironmental\n\nquality\n\nIntegrated\nplanning\n\nHousing\nplanning\n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \n\njustice\n\nParticipation\nand\n\nempowerment\n\nCollaborative \nand \n\ncommunity-led\ninitiatives\n\nTHE\n(SUSTAINABLE)\n\nCITY\n\nLow-carbon city lens\n\nCircular city lens\n\nHealthy city lens\n\nInclusive city lens\n\nGreen city lens\n\nResilient city lens\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nEnabling factors\n\nLenses\n\nContext (the geography of a \nparticular city as well as its urban \nform, infrastructure, people, \ninstitutions, etc.)\n\nCO2\n\nCONTEXT\n\nFigure ES.2 Conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\n\u00a9 Daniel Kusak, My City/EEA\n\f\n15Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n1 \nIntroduction\n\n1.1 Background\n\n1.1.1 Purpose of the report\n\nThis report presents the results of research undertaken to \nsupport the preparation of the EEA report Urban sustainability in \nEurope \u2014 Avenues for change (EEA, 2021). It presents the analysis \nof eight urban environmental sustainability nexuses. These \nexamples were used to help understand the complexity of urban \nsystems and explore how, in practice, using nexus analysis could \nhelp identify existing challenges, potential trade-offs, actions \nto achieve urban sustainability objectives and opportunities to \nmove towards better coordinated and integrated policy and \naction. The analysis is followed by overall findings and lessons \nfrom the example nexuses. These findings are also summarised \nin the main Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change \nreport.\n\n1.1.2 The need for integrated policymaking in cities\n\nThe European environment \u2014 State and outlook 2020: Knowledge \nfor transition to a sustainable Europe (SOER\u00a02020)\tstresses\tthat\t\nachieving sustainability transitions requires coherence across \npolicy domains and scales. Policies and actions are often \ndeveloped in silos, addressing specific sectors or issues, with \ncontrasting objectives (EEA, 2019a). Likewise, research and \nknowledge development are frequently compartmentalised \nalong disciplinary boundaries. This means that misalignment \nand conflicts are inevitable, and it limits shared understanding \nof systemic challenges and responses that fully reflect the \n'barriers, opportunities, trade-offs and co-benefits associated \nwith systemic change' (EEA, 2019a). There is a need for 'policies \nthat embrace the inherent interconnectedness of systems \ncomponents, interactions across systems, and links between \neconomic, social and environmental goals' (EEA, 2019a).\n\nThis is certainly the case in cities and metropolitan area and \ntheir peripheries, where the complexity of interactions between \nsocio-economic and environmental factors present significant \nchallenges for improving quality of life while minimising \nenvironmental pressures and resource depletion. However, \nurban areas also provide opportunities for positive systemic \n\nchange. What is needed is better coordination and prioritisation \nof policy and action across sectors. The prioritisation aspect is \nparticularly important here, as 'total integration' of everything \nwith everything else as part of political processes is impossible. \nHowever, recognising and prioritising critical interrelationships \nthat have not been addressed appropriately is a key first step \nfor better integrated policymaking (Rode, 2018). By considering \npriority interlinkages between systems and policy areas, \nenvironmental, social and economic trade-offs and  \nco\t-benefits\u00a0(1) can be identified (Rode, 2018; EEA, 2019a).\n\n1.1.3 The nexus concept and urban nexus analysis\n\nOne approach to thinking about the interactions between \nsystems and policies is the nexus approach. Box 1.1 provides \nmore information on the nexus concept, approach and analysis. \nA nexus is defined as the interlinkages and interrelationships \nbetween two or more systems (e.g. food and energy) or policy \nareas. Nexus analysis refers to the identification and analysis \nof the interactions, interrelationships and interdependencies \namong sectors and policies or other interventions. The nexus \napproach involves proactive and integrated policy engagement \nwith such interrelated sectors, resulting in a new approach to \ndeveloping policy and action. In an urban context this means \nconsidering together two or more urban policy areas in order to \naddress a specific urban environmental sustainability problem \nor to advance a policy objective. By identifying priority synergies, \nco-benefits and trade-offs, opportunities can be identified for \nbetter coordinated and integrated policy and action.\n\nConsidering urban issues in this way is intended to improve \nour understanding of interactions and enable more coherent \nand effective policy and other interventions that can identify \nand minimise trade-offs and 'reduce environmental pressures\u2026 \nrealising potential co-benefits for human health and well-being' \n(EEA, 2019a). A nexus approach can help decision-makers \nchoose the most appropriate policy measures or other actions \nto help identify cost-effective interventions and minimise hidden \nor unanticipated costs. Cost-effectiveness is defined as either, \nfor a given outcome (e.g. a percentage reduction in air pollution), \nminimising the net-present value of costs or, for a given cost, \nmaximising the relevant outcome(s) (EC, 2014).  \n\n(1) A co-benefit is where the delivery of one policy area or intervention can help achieve outcomes in another policy area. For example, an \nintervention to encourage active travel (walking and cycling) could have the main objective of improving public health but might have  \nco-benefits of reducing congestion and air and noise pollution, thus improving quality of life.\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n16 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nIn the context of urban environmental sustainability,  \ncost-effectiveness also considers the co-benefits of an \nintervention (e.g. the health benefits of meeting a primary \nobjective of reduced air pollution).\n\nIn summary as presented in Figure 1.1, the potential benefits \nof conducting nexus analysis for urban environmental \nsustainability are to:\n\n\u2022 help manage the complexity of urban systems by \nidentifying critical interrelationships, co-dependencies \nand trade-offs between selected aspects of urban \nenvironmental sustainability and/or desired policies and \nother\u00a0interventions;\n\n\u2022 identify and assess specific counteracting and reinforcing \npolicies and other interventions and their outcomes;\n\n\u2022 improve understanding of how to achieve multiple \noutcomes and objectives together and take advantage of \nco-benefits;\n\n\u2022 identify opportunities for improved policy integration and \nefficacy, by jointly considering multiple objectives and \ndesired outcomes; \n\n\u2022 through the above, help to identify cost-effective urban \nsustainability policy and action.\n\nBox 1.1 The nexus concept and its use in an urban context\n\nThe term 'nexus' by definition refers to the interlinkages or connections between two or more elements. A 'nexus \napproach' implies explicitly considering these connections or interlinkages between resources or sectors and the \nimplications of these in, for example, the context of a strategic or policy goal (Magic Nexus, 2018). Hoff (2011) puts \nthe nexus approach in the context of system efficiency over sector productivity: 'The nexus focus is on system \nefficiency, rather than on the productivity of isolated sectors.' The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations considers the nexus approach as a 'conceptual approach to better understand and systematically analyse \nthe interactions between the natural environment and human activities, and to work towards a more coordinated \nmanagement and use of natural resources across sectors and scales' (FAO, 2014).\n\nThe nexus approach therefore explicitly recognises synergies and trade-offs as necessary for the development of \nresponse options. The approach helps ensure the sustainability of the environment and people's livelihoods, facilitating \nmore integrated and cost-effective policymaking, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThe EEA's 2020 state of the environment report introduces the concept of the 'resource nexus'. This recognises that \n'links between \u2026 systems arise because of their shared reliance on natural systems, both as a source of resources and \nas a sink for wastes and emissions'. This shared reliance means that 'addressing problems in one area may simply shift \nthe burden to other systems'. A resource nexus approach can also help highlight the interdependence of production \nand consumption systems and their cumulative impacts (e.g. on ecosystems). Achieving the transition to a low-carbon, \nresource-efficient economy 'will require that the interlinkages across systems are considered and the trade-offs and \nco-benefits identified' (EEA, 2019a).\n\nThe focus of existing definitions of the nexus approach is predominantly on resource efficiency and the management of \nscarcity. However, in an urban context a different focus may be appropriate. UNESCAP (2016) discusses the urban nexus \nas focusing on the interlinkages among various elements and their 'conversion pathways' \u2014 the extraction, supply, \ndistribution, end use, disposal \u2014 in consumption and production chains of socio-economic sectors. Furthermore, \nUNESCAP suggests that cities serve as a nexus, or a focal point that connects and is shaped by economic, technological \nand social forces (UNESCAP, 2016). UNESCAP (2016) and Lehman (2018) propose an 'intra-urban nexus' and a 'nested \nurban nexus', the former focusing 'solely on what is urban in the nexus framing', including urban metabolism, \ninfrastructure and human security, while the latter recognises that nexus dynamics need to be understood in the \ncontext of driving and constraining forces at both lower and higher levels, meaning that nexus analysis at a city level will \nneed to consider developments at other levels, e.g. global, regional or national policy developments and ecosystems at \nsub-national and regional levels.\n\nICLEI and GIZ (2014) defined the use of urban nexus analysis as an 'approach that guides stakeholders to identify \nand pursue possible synergies between sectors, jurisdictions, and technical domains, so as to increase institutional \nperformance, optimize resource management, and service quality'. Rode (2018) discusses the urban nexus as helping \nto facilitate a move away from the 'functionally segregated city and its simplistic view of the relationship between \nurban life and city design' towards an approach that can 'better address the complexities, interrelationships and \nco-dependencies \u2026 characteristic of city systems'. Rode (2018) in particular focuses on what is seen as 'the critical nexus' \nof urban form and transport, which provides a good illustration of the nexus approach in practice, as 'both elements \nneed to be dealt with jointly to provide accessibility to people, goods and ideas in cities'.\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n17Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n1.2 Priority urban sustainability nexuses\n\nDrawing on the urban environmental sustainability conceptual \nframework (see Chapter 2 of the Urban sustainability in Europe \n\u2014 Avenues for change report), literature review and stakeholder \ninput, eight priority urban sustainability nexuses were identified \nand selected. Table 1.1 presents an overview of these nexuses. \nThe eight nexuses were selected to cover a range of key \nurban sustainability objectives and to reflect the main topics \naddressed by EU environmental and climate policies. They also \nhighlight some of the most critical interrelationships between \nsectors that are currently not considered appropriately as part \nof policymaking and action. They are not, however, intended \nto be comprehensive, as a great many other sustainability \nobjectives and critical interrelationships exist, and in meeting \nthese objectives a very large number of critical policy \ninteractions or nexuses could be identified.\n\nThe overall aim of the urban nexus analysis is to explore \ncritical interlinkages and interrelationships between two \nor more policy areas that need to be considered together \nin order to advance an urban sustainability objective. The \nselected urban nexuses are intended to be examples of how \nthis analysis approach could be used in practice to identify \nexisting challenges to achieving urban sustainability objectives \nand opportunities to move towards better coordinated and \nintegrated\tpolicy\tand\u00a0action.\n\nEach nexus is framed around meeting a high-level urban \nsustainability objective (e.g. climate resilience, food security) \nthat is systemic in nature and requires coordinated \npolicymaking and action. Meeting these nexus objectives \n\ncould require interventions in a large number of policy areas. \nHowever, for the nexus analysis in each case, three interlinked \npolicy areas were selected to help identify examples of key \ninteractions, challenges and opportunities for prioritisation \nand coordination of policy and interventions. Different or \nadditional policy areas could be selected to broaden the \nanalysis or to focus on other policy priorities. However, the \nselection for this analysis is intended to represent some of the \nkey areas in which coordinated policy is required. Although \ndifferent cities may use different terminology and have \ndivergent levels of authority or autonomy, the selected policy \nareas are intended to be representative of strategy, policy and \nother interventions commonly seen in cities.\n\nThe assessment draws on the conceptual framework, by \nconsidering actions in the context of the 'building blocks' of \nurban sustainability that are relevant to the key policy areas \nin each nexus. Each nexus analysis also explores one example \nof a challenge and the actions to address it in more detail. By \nfocusing the analysis in this way, the intention is to facilitate a \nmore detailed assessment than would be possible if a larger \nnumber of challenges and actions were considered. Of course, \neach nexus has many potential challenges and associated \nactions and these will differ from city to city.\n\nThe nexus analysis is based on an assessment of what \nchallenges cities typically face in meeting urban sustainability \nobjectives, which critical interrelationships are currently \n'under-serviced' and how action can be better coordinated and/\nor prioritised across the selected policy areas. In doing so, the \nanalysis can identify co-benefits and trade-offs and help to \nimprove the cost-effectiveness of interventions.\n\nFigure 1.1 The value of conducting nexus analysis for urban environmental sustainability\n\nTransition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nWhat enablers need \nto be in place?\n\nWhat barriers need\nto be avoided?\n\nWhat outcomes are \npart of the vision?\n\nWhat components\nare required?\n\nWhat is the influence\nof complexity?\n\nWhat contextual\nfactors are influential?\n\nWhat are the different\nperspectives?\n\nWhat qualities and\nprocesses contribute?\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nIntroduction \n\n18 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nA template was used to develop each example nexus.

This is an urgent issue: in 2019 the European \nParliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, \nand we also saw the emergence of the youth strikes for \nclimate movement (EC, 2019a). Careful planning and action \nthat considers climate risks can make a city more resilient. The \nimportance of urban resilience to climate change is emphasised \nin the EU strategy for adaptation to climate change (EC, 2013) \nand by the Climate Adaptation Partnership of the urban agenda \nfor the EU (Climate Adaptation Partnership, 2018). As part of the \nEuropean Green Deal a new, more ambitious, EU strategy on \nadaptation to climate change is planned in 2020/21 (EC, 2019b; \nEEA, 2020a). To provide a legal basis for the European Green \nDeal goal of the EU becoming climate neutral by 2050, the \nEuropean Commission has proposed the first European Climate \nLaw (EEA, 2020a). The law aims to ensure that all EU policies and \nall sectors of the economy and society contribute to the goal of \nclimate neutrality.\n\nA range of perspectives and definitions of resilience exist \nacross policy, practice and research. This ranges from a narrow, \nengineering-based, structural definition of resilience to an \ninterdisciplinary concept focused on the interrelationship \nbetween social and ecological systems (Armitage et al., 2012). \nA distinction is also made between proactive and reactive \nresilience. Reactive resilience focuses on resistance and \n'bounce-back' after a shock and suggests a return to the \nstatus quo. Proactive resilience emphasises adaptation and \ntransformation in response to both shocks and stresses and \nsuggests a need to change existing conditions (Twigger-Ross \net al., 2015). Proactive resilience is particularly relevant in \nrelation to urban sustainability. By avoiding 'bouncing back' \nto a previous, potentially unsustainable state, cities can adapt, \ntransform and learn while following new trajectories for future \ndevelopment (Chelleri et al., 2015).\n\nUrban areas are affected by climate change in direct and \nindirect ways. It is often the result of the compounded effects of \nclimate hazards and the consequences of unsustainable forms \nof urban development, such as air pollution or limited surface \nwater drainage in cities. Building urban resilience implies \nmoving away from unsustainable urban development practices \n\nwhile implementing measures to adapt to and mitigate climate \nchange. Recognising and accounting for the synergies between \nadaptation and mitigation measures can help ensure that \nmanaging climate change impacts will also reduce the impacts \nof greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and vice versa.\n\nA climate-resilient city requires individuals, communities, \ninstitutions, businesses and systems to have the capacity to \nreduce exposure to, prepare for, cope with, recover better from, \nand adapt and transform as needed in response to the impacts \nof climate change.\n\nThe focus of this nexus is on the objective of achieving urban \nclimate resilience, which is an important aspect of urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Enhanced climate resilience \nwill help a city tolerate climate change impacts and natural \ndisasters. In doing so, it can avoid the potential collapse of \nsocial, economic, and technical systems and infrastructures. \nSuch a collapse of urban systems may have far-reaching \nconsequences for individuals and urban communities. A city \nthat lacks climate resilience may be vulnerable to even small \ndisturbances, such as localised flooding events.\n\nIf cities enhance their climate resilience this can also support \nprogress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through more sustainable use \nof land and through green infrastructure (GI) measures that \nsequester carbon, maintain and enhance biodiversity and \nimprove air quality.\n\n\u2022 Sustainable buildings \u2014 through standards for new and \nretrofitted buildings to reduce GHG emissions, and through \nusing sustainable heating and cooling to help buildings \nadapt to a changing climate.\n\n\u2022 Quality of life (QoL) \u2014 through nature-based \nsolutions\u00a0(NbS)\tthat\tcan,\tfor\texample,\treduce\tflood\trisk\tand\t\nprotect people's homes.\n\nClimate resilience can also contribute to other nexus outcomes, \nincluding 'closing the loop', through minimising consumption \nof resources to prevent GHG emissions, and 'clean energy', for \nexample by using rooftops for renewable energy production to \nreduce GHG emissions.\n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n22 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n2.1.1 The climate resilience nexus and the \nCOVID-19 \u00a0pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown \nmeasures altered all aspects of urban life, many cities had to \nreconsider their resilience to large shocks, including climate \nchange. Ensuring access to urban green spaces for the public \nemerged as a fundamental strategy of cities when coping \nwith this crisis. In addition, local authorities across Europe are \nreshaping their transport networks by reallocating some road \nspace from private cars to public transport, pedestrians and \ncyclists. This has provided cities with opportunities to reduce \nemissions from vehicles and increase greening (EEA, 2020a). \nThe requirement for social distancing to manage the spread \nof the virus has also led cities to review and adjust their heat \naction plans. This is due to the potential contradiction between \nadvice given to the public for managing heat stress and that \nfor managing COVID-19, such as the advice to go to public \nair-conditioned spaces (EEA, 2020a).\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting the importance of cities \nbeing resilient to shocks. The growing awareness of resilience \nas a wider concept and the cascading effects of the COVID-19 \ncrisis across systems (e.g. mobility, food) have highlighted the \nimportance of planning for future risks. The pandemic has \nalso had a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable \ngroups in society. In their resilience strategies cities need to \nreflect on the social justice implications of climate risks and \nadaptation\u00a0actions.\n\nAs part of their green recovery plans cities could take advantage \nof\tthe\tNext\tGeneration\tEU\trecovery\tpackage\u00a0(2) and support \nfrom national governments to implement measures that \nalso build climate resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic also \nstrengthens the case for the climate adaptation and mitigation \npotential of green areas in cities. While cities are managing the \nhealth crisis, these circumstances provide an opportunity to \nmainstream adaptation across policy areas and to make it an \nessential part of a green recovery. For example, in their policies \n\nfor sustainable and healthy buildings, cities could encourage \nincreased use of vegetation to manage urban heat waves. The \npandemic is likely to result in major changes across various \nsectors that may have climate adaptation and mitigation \nbenefits. For example, cities will need to revisit and change \nthe transport infrastructure to shift the focus from mobility to \naccessibility and to prioritise active transport.\n\n2.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nclimate resilience in cities\n\nClimate resilience is a broad area, and making cities more \nresilient will require coordinated action across a wide range \nof policy areas. This nexus focuses on three interconnected \npolicy areas: spatial planning, GI and the built environment. \nConsidering these together can lead to a more transformative \napproach to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change \nimpacts (Figure 2.1). Addressing adaptation and mitigation \ntogether may also be cost-effective way of improving \nclimate\u00a0resilience.\n\nIntegrating these selected nexus policy areas is also likely to \nhelp minimise trade-offs and lead to co-benefits. For example, \nNbS can have adaptation (e.g. flood risk management) and \nmitigation (e.g. carbon sequestration) outcomes, but they can \nalso enhance QoL by creating or enhancing green spaces; \nencourages sustainable transport whereby space is created \nfor cycling and walking; provide socio-economic benefits \n(create new green jobs, make areas more attractive to \ninvestors, reduce health service costs); and improve air quality \n(Raymond et al., 2017; IEEP, 2021).\n\nYet, there are also some potential trade-offs. For example, \nthe creation of green spaces in inner city areas may conflict \nwith the goal of a 'compact city'. This concept aims to make \ncities more accessible to sustainable transport (walking, \ncycling and public transport) in order to reduce urban sprawl. \nIn addition, creating or enhancing green spaces can lead to \nhigher land and property prices in adjacent neighbourhoods \nand may trigger gentrification (Raymond et al., 2017). \nWithout accompanying policies and measures (e.g. related \nto affordable housing) this may exacerbate inequalities \nwithin\t\u00a0cities.\n\n(2) https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n23Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nGreen\ninfrastructure\n\nBuilt\nenvironmentSpatial planning\n\nExample challenge and action: \nManaging urban flood risk by \nusing nature-based solutions\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nenhance climate resilience\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks \nsupporting climate resilience\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nBuilt \nenvironment \n\nquality\n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nSustainable urban\nagriculture\n\nParticipation\nand\n\nempowerment\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nFigure 2.1 The climate resilience nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges of \nachieving climate resilience in cities and how coordinated action \ncan enhance it. Table 2.1 then provides an overview of the \nchallenges and actions to address them. There follows a more \ndetailed assessment of an example illustrating how coordinated \naction can help achieve climate resilience in cities: managing \nurban flood risk by using NbS (Section 2.2.1).\n\nChallenges of and actions for achieving climate  \nresilience in cities\n\nUnder a changing climate, cities will need to respond to a range \nof impacts. These could include heat waves, wildfires, extreme \nweather events (e.g. storms, hail), more intense precipitation, \ncoastal flooding and sea level rise, pluvial and river flooding, \nand drought. Building urban climate resilience requires taking \naction to avoid, minimise and withstand climate change \nimpacts while also adapting and transforming as needed \n(rather than returning to the status quo). From an urban \nsustainability perspective, actions to build resilience should \naim to minimise consumption of resources, ensure equitable \ndistribution of the benefits of adaptation to all and enhance \neconomic\u00a0sustainability.\n\nTo enhance climate resilience cities will need to build adaptive \ncapacity and reduce vulnerability. The specific actions a city \ngovernment chooses will depend on a range of contextual \nfactors and conditions, including:\n\n\u2022 the resilience of existing infrastructure and systems;\n\n\u2022 the location and geographical setting of the city  \n(e.g. coastal, topography);\n\n\u2022 existing environmental qualities, and physical and social \nconditions;\n\n\u2022 existing levels of inequality and vulnerability; \n\n\u2022 existing awareness of and political support for climate \naction.\n\nThe 2020 EEA report on urban adaptation in Europe notes \nthat 'the number of local authorities committed to adaptation \nand the number of those planning and implementing \nadaptation measures has grown rapidly' with 'over a quarter \nof the population in EEA-38 \u2026 living in local authorities \ncommitted to adaptation under the Covenant of Mayors for \nClimate and Energy' (EEA, 2020a). In spite of this progress, \nthe adoption of local adaptation strategies has been slower \nthan originally envisaged. By 2020 all cities with more than \n150\u00a0000 inhabitants were expected to have adopted an \nadaptation\tstrategy.\tIn\t2018,\tonly\t40\u00a0%\tof\tthis\ttarget\thad\t\nbeen achieved (EEA, 2020a). This means that many cities still \nlack coherent, cross-sectoral resilience strategies. Climate \nadaptation and resilience is also rarely mainstreamed across \nother policy areas. There is thus a need for cities to prepare \ncomprehensive resilience strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic \nmight encourage local policymakers to take action, as it \nhas highlighted the importance of cities being resilient to \nunprecedented shocks.\n\nHowever, many cities lack the technical and institutional \ncapacity to strategically prepare for climate change and to \nbuild adaptive capacity. Cities can seek to build technical and \ninstitutional capacity by engaging with city networks such as \nthe Covenant of Mayors, which has developed resources and \n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n24 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nmaterials\tto\tsupport\tcities\u00a0(3), such as its Urban Adaptation \nSupport\tTool\u00a0(4) (developed jointly with the EEA). The Covenant \nof Mayors also provides opportunities for peer-to-peer \nlearning, such as through twinning, capacity-building events \nand webinars. Another means of building capacity could \nbe through training or recruiting experienced officers with \nresponsibility for climate resilience.\n\nAs well as capacity to develop climate resilience strategies, \na further capacity-related challenge can be insufficient \nexpertise and knowledge of the range of climate change \nadaptation approaches (e.g. incremental and transformative) \nand specific measures that should be implemented. There \nare mechanisms that cities can adopt to help build their \ninstitutional and technical capacity.\n\nAlongside technical and capacity challenges, financing climate \nresilience interventions may also act as a barrier. However, \nvarious potential sources of funding may be available to \nEuropean cities. Funding at the national level will vary between \nMember States. EU-level finance potentially available to cities \nincludes\tthe\tfollowing:\tthe\tEU\tLIFE\u00a0(5) programme, which \nsupports projects exploring innovative ways of integrating \nadaptation into urban land use planning, building layouts and \nmanagement of natural resources; the European Regional \nDevelopment\tFund\t(ERDF)\u00a0(6), which prioritises climate \nadaptation funding; and the European Investment Bank (EIB), \nwhich supports adaptation interventions such as Jessica (Joint \nEuropean\tSupport\tfor\tSustainable\tInvestment\tin\tCity\tAreas)\u00a0(7). \nCities could also take advantage of the Next Generation \nEU\trecovery\tpackage\u00a0(8) to build adaptation measures into \ntheir recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Covenant \nof Mayors website provides a comprehensive overview of \nfunding available to cities for actions to address climate \n\nchange\u00a0(9). There are also international financial institutions \nthat provide support for cities to address climate change \nissues. For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand\tDevelopment\tGreen\tCities\tprogramme\u00a0(10) helps local \nauthorities to invest in sustainable municipal infrastructure.\n\nWhere cities have resilience strategies in place, together with \nthe finance and the technical capacity to implement them, a \nrange of approaches can help adapt and transform cities into \nattractive, climate-resilient and sustainable places. Approaches \nfor 'coping' with extreme events and 'incremental' adaptation \nto improve existing adaptation measures can both offer \neffective short- and medium-term solutions (EEA, 2016b). \nWhere more fundamental change is required, 'transformative' \nadaptation offers longer-term solutions. Transformative \nadaptation addresses the systemic nature of climate change \nand enables cities to embrace change (EEA, 2016a). An \nexample of a transformative approach can be found in the \nNetherlands, where the country is attempting to find ways of \nliving with different water levels, instead continuing to try to \nkeep the water out. Box 2.1 provides examples of incremental \nand transformative approaches.\n\nClimate change impacts do not affect all citizens in the same \nway. Extreme events, such as flooding caused by heavy rainfall \nor heat waves, often have the most impact on vulnerable \ngroups in society. Similarly, approaches to building resilience \nto climate change can also exacerbate social and economic \ninequalities. Understanding inequalities with respect to climate \nimpacts and solutions is a key condition for addressing this \nchallenge. Yet, in most European cities there is still limited \nawareness of this problem and of the need for adaptation and \nmitigation interventions to be designed to address the needs \nof vulnerable groups (ETC/CCA, 2018).\n\n(3) https://www.covenantofmayors.eu/support/adaptation-resources.html\n(4) https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/knowledge/tools/urban-ast/step-0-0\n(5) https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/life/life-calls-proposals_en\n(6) https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/erdf\n(7) https://www.eib.org/en/products/mandates-partnerships/esif/index.htm\n(8) https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940\n(9) https://www.covenantofmayors.eu/support/funding.html\n(10) https://www.ebrdgreencities.com\n\nhttps://www.covenantofmayors.eu/support/adaptation-resources.html\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n25Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 2.1  Examples of incremental and transformative approaches to adaptation\n\nExamples of incremental and transformative approaches to dealing with selected climate change impacts (flooding and \noverheating) include (based on EEA, 2016a, p. 35):\n\n\u2022 Flooding:\n\n\u2022 coping approaches \u2014 e.g. making flood insurance obligatory to distribute the burden of economic damage \nfrom flooding across society;\n\n\u2022 incremental approaches \u2014 e.g. adding floodgates to buildings, upgrading sewerage systems and using \nsustainable urban drainage systems;\n\n\u2022 transformative approaches \u2014 e.g. land use and spatial planning to create space for water; reducing soil \nsealing to allow natural drainage; placing infrastructure on higher ground; retreating from low-lying  \nflood-prone areas; making use of floating buildings and infrastructure; developing infrastructure and buildings \nthat can be temporarily flooded with little or no damage; harvesting and reusing rainwater; and using  \nnature-based solutions and green infrastructure (see Section 2.2.1).\n\n\u2022 Overheating:\n\n\u2022 coping approaches \u2014 e.g. providing heat alerts for the most vulnerable people and directing them to 'cooling \ncentres' or other places where they can stay cool;\n\n\u2022 incremental approaches \u2014 e.g. additional and/or improved air conditioning;\n\n\u2022 transformative approaches \u2014 e.g. changing city design (e.g. cooling through use of green infrastructure), \nchanging building design (e.g. using passive cooling) and changing behaviour (e.g. working in the cooler parts of \nthe day).\n\n\u2022 Water scarcity and droughts:\n\n\u2022 coping approaches \u2014 e.g. encouraging lower household consumption (e.g. recommending taking showers \ninstead of baths, using water-saving appliances in households and buildings, prohibiting garden watering and \nswimming pool refilling); selecting drought-tolerant plants in urban areas and introducing new regulations in \nthe agricultural sector (e.g. temporary interdiction of using water sprinklers, allowing only drip irrigation at \nnight); and introducing temporary emergency measures to protect freshwater bodies and reservoirs;\n\n\u2022 incremental approaches \u2014 e.g. meeting the demand for water by getting it from deeper wells, desalinisation, \nfrom other regions and additional storage, water rationing and reducing leakage.\n\n\u2022 transformative approaches \u2014 e.g. reducing the demand by using water-saving appliances in households \nand buildings, reusing and recycling water, awareness raising, establish water-saving behaviours and changing \nproduction processes (e.g. agriculture, livestock) to use less water, and creating infiltration areas based on \necosystem services for replenishing groundwater.\n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n26 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nThis challenge can be addressed through a range of \nmechanisms. Engaging local citizens (including vulnerable \ngroups and those less likely to engage in 'traditional' citizen \nparticipation processes) through participative decision-making \non the choice and design of adaptation and mitigation options \ncan help to identify the difficulties and needs of disadvantaged \ngroups (EEA, 2020a). In planning and designing climate \nadaptation (and mitigation) interventions the needs of the \nmost vulnerable groups should be considered. A vulnerability \nanalysis could help to identify specific needs and particular \nforms of vulnerabilities determined by social differences (ETC/\nCCA, 2018). Coping approaches can also be an effective way \nto address some elements of inequality (see also Box 2.1). For \nexample, making flood insurance obligatory (and supporting \nthose least able to afford it), ensuring heat and flooding alerts \nare understandable and reach those most at risk (e.g. the \nelderly and families with children) or subsidising or building \ngrey water systems (that harvest rainwater) to build climate \nresilience while reducing the costs for the economically \nvulnerable.\n\nAnother key challenge is how to build resilience while \naccounting for potential interactions between climate \nadaptation and mitigation measures. A poorly coordinated \npolicy mix may lead to undesirable trade-offs, while there are \nbenefits in linking adaptation and mitigation when designing \nand implementing climate-related activities (Kongsager, 2018). \nImproving communication and integration of actions between \nlocal administration departments can help avoid trade-offs and \nsave resources for dealing with unwanted consequences.\n\nCertain adaptation options, particularly those related to \n'grey' infrastructure, may make greater demands on energy \nand material resources and increase GHG emissions (EEA, \n2016a). In addition, physical infrastructure projects can \ncreate lock-ins. This occurs when cities invest heavily in into \nsolutions that are not long-term sustainable solutions for \n\nurban resilience. An example would be investing in urban \nenergy and transport infrastructure that lock the city into \nunsustainable energy generation and travel choices. Such \nlock-ins are typically costly or politically difficult to change. \nHowever, coordination of adaptation and mitigation action is \nyet to be widely established across European cities. Just over \na quarter of European cities explicitly consider the synergies \nand co-benefits between adaptation and mitigation in their \nclimate change action plans (Aguiar, 2018).\n\nSynergies between adaptation and mitigation policy are found \nwhere policies and investment to reduce GHG emissions also \nhelp to manage climate change impacts and vice versa. For \nexample, reforestation programmes to stabilise degraded soils \nat risk of landslides and erosion can also sequester carbon. \nCreating synergies through combined measures can increase \nthe cost-efficiency of actions and make them more attractive to \nstakeholders, including potential funding agencies.\n\nAlthough adaptation is key for urban climate resilience, without \nmitigation the growing pressure from climate change in the \nlong term will undermine cities' efforts to remain resilient. Cities \nacross Europe are seeking to reduce or prevent GHG emissions \nthrough a range of strategies. Cities can shift to renewable \nenergy sources, retrofit buildings to make them more energy \nefficient, develop more sustainable transport systems, and \npromote more sustainable uses of land and GI. Economic \n(e.g. costs, incumbent interests) and social (e.g. existing \nbehaviours, equality) factors can make the implementation of \nsuch measures challenging (Hendrickson et al., 2016). Citizen \nengagement through participative decision-making may be key \nin designing measures and in ensuring local buy-in and uptake. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown that some transformative \nchanges can be implemented much faster than previously \nassumed. When facing a deep crisis, cities have shown that \nthey can radically transform how they operate and how people \noperate within them.\n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n27Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Weak institutional capacity and lack of \ncross-sectoral integration acting as a \nbarrier to building adaptive capacity and \nreducing vulnerability.\n\n\u2022 Seek to build institutional capacity, e.g. by engaging with city networks on \nclimate change (e.g. Covenant of Mayors) and training or recruiting staff.\n\n\u2022 Improve communication and integration between different departments \nof local administrations.\n\n\u2022 Lack of technical expertise in and \nknowledge of the range of climate change \nadaptation approaches (e.g. incremental \nand transformative) and specific measures \nthat should be implemented. \n\n\u2022 Adopt incremental approaches that maintain the essence and integrity of \nsystems by going beyond existing actions to deal with natural variation in \nclimate and with extreme events.\n\n\u2022 Adopt transformative approaches that offer longer-term solutions to deal \nwith climate impacts. \n\n\u2022 Insufficient financial resources to design \nand implement adaptation measures.\n\n\u2022 Explore funding mechanisms available at national and EU level. For \nexample, at the EU level, financial support for adaptation interventions can \nbe accessed through the LIFE programme, ERDF and EIB, e.g. through their \nfinancial support for integrated, sustainable urban renewal programmes.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate awareness of and insufficient \naccounting for social inequalities in \nrelation to climate impacts and solutions.\n\n\u2022 Engage local citizens (including vulnerable groups and those less likely to \nengage in 'traditional' citizen participation processes) through participative \ndecision-making on the choice and design of adaptation and mitigation \noptions to ensure local buy-in and secure uptake.\n\n\u2022 Perform specific vulnerability analysis to understand needs and identify \nvulnerabilities determined by social differences.\n\n\u2022 Design climate adaptation and mitigation interventions to address the \nneeds of the most vulnerable groups.\n\n\u2022 Adopt coping approaches such as making flood insurance obligatory, \nproviding heat alerts for most vulnerable people, harvesting rainwater \nand using less water-intensive sanitation techniques as short- and \nmedium-term solutions to deal with climate impacts.\n\n\u2022 Lack of accounting for potential \ninteractions between climate adaptation \nand mitigation measures to avoid \nundesirable trade-offs/maximise \nsynergies.\n\n\u2022 Explicitly consider the synergies and co-benefits between adaptation and \nmitigation in city climate change action plans to reduce GHG emissions \nand help manage climate change impacts.\n\n\u2022 Link adaptation and mitigation policies and investments to maximise \nsynergies.\n\nTable 2.1 Overview of challenges and actions for achieving climate resilience in cities \n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n28 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n2.2.1 Example assessment of interlinked actions: \nmanaging urban flood risk by using  \nnature\u2011based solutions\n\nHow do nature-based solutions manage urban \nflooding fit within the climate resilience nexus?\n\nNature-based solutions as a flood risk management \nstrategy will:\n\n\u2022 require spatial planning policy that protects \nexisting, or supports the creation of new, open \nand green spaces and facilitates their use for flood \nmanagement;\n\n\u2022 can replace or reduce the need for built \ninfrastructure such as culverts and drainage; \n\n\u2022 can be designed and implemented to help meet the \nneed for green infrastructure in a city by providing \ngreen spaces that benefit biodiversity and people.\n\nClimate change is expected to increase the intensity and \nfrequency of extreme rainfall, which is one of the main drivers \nof urban flooding (Hammond et al., 2013). Flood risk in cities \nis exacerbated by the extent of impermeable land surfaces, \ncoupled with housing and commercial development in river \nfloodplains (EEA, 2016b). The main cause of urban flooding is \nthe increase in soil sealing (resulting in a limited land area for \nwater absorption or storage) that increases the pressure on \ndrainage systems that often lack the capacity to handle intense \nrainfall events (Warhurst et al. 2014; Ochoa-Rodriguez, 2021).\n\nUrban flooding can lead to physical, economic, social and \nenvironmental impacts. In the short term, these can include \nhuman health risks (physical and mental), property damage \nand losses, and failure of infrastructure such as transport and \nelectricity networks. In the longer-term, the disruption caused \nby flooding can have economic impacts that extend beyond the \nimmediately affected city (Hammond et al., 2013).\n\n\u00a9 Matthew on Unsplash\n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n29Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nA range of measures could be used to address urban flood \nrisk. However, there is increasing attention on the potential of \nNbS, which may include creating and enhancing GI in a city and \nsmaller-scale actions such as installing green roofs. NbS aim to \nhelp societies address a variety of environmental, social and \neconomic challenges. They are actions inspired by, supported \nby or copied from nature (EC, 2015a). NbS use the features \nand system processes of nature in order to achieve desired \noutcomes. For example, by using natural processes to reduce \nurban run-off and increase urban water storage (e.g. tree \nplanting, creation of reed beds and ponds for temporary water \nstorage), NbS can mitigate flood risk. The approach therefore \nemphasises that maintaining and enhancing natural capital is of \ncrucial importance, as it forms the basis for solutions  \n(EC, 2015a).\n\nNbS have the potential to provide multiple co-benefits beyond \nenhancing resilience to urban flooding (EEA, 2016b; IEEP, 2021). \nFor example, the use of GI (e.g. restoring wetland areas and \nfloodplains) can also have human health benefits by improving \nair quality and providing space for recreation. GI will also have \nenvironmental benefits from providing a buffer for habitats \nand species and climate mitigation benefits from carbon \nsequestration (EEA, 2017a; IEEP, 2021). NbS also potentially \navoid the potential trade-offs arising from implementing grey \ninfrastructure solutions to flood protection, such as increased \nGHG emissions during construction or operation.\n\nMaximising co-benefits and limiting trade-offs while using NbS \nrequires the interactions between various policy areas to be \nconsidered (EEA, 2016a). For example, coordination between \nwater and other policy areas (e.g. land use planning, transport) \nto reduce flood risk at the local level (EEA, 2016b). Long-term \nurban spatial planning is particularly important to maximise \nco-benefits and limit trade-offs (EEA, 2020a). It can account for \nfuture climate change impacts and for the changing needs of a \ncity. Decision-makers also need to consider collaborations and \nharmonisation of policy responses and interventions across \nadministrative boundaries and scales. For example, a city may \nbe able to address some flood risks, such as local stormwater \ndischarge, but cannot on its own reduce the risk from upstream \nriver flooding (EEA, 2016a).\n\nBox 2.2  Example policy response: blue-green \ninfrastructure mitigating urban flooding \nin Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nFollowing multiple heavy rainfall events, Copenhagen \ndeveloped a cloudburst management plan. It addresses \nthe eight central city catchments and includes 300 \nseparate projects that are expected to run over the \ncourse of the next 20 years. These projects are designed \nto increase the city's blue-green infrastructure and \nenhance its resilience to flooding.\n\nCopenhagen concretisation masterplans were \ndeveloped for a number of these catchment areas. \nThese integrated, multidisciplinary plans bridge the \ngap between planning and site-specific solutions. This \nwas achieved through the application of a cloudburst \nformula \u2014 a six-step procedure designed for integrating \nblue-green infrastructure solutions. The cloudburst \nformula is shaped by investigation, modelling and \nmapping, analysis of the cost of doing nothing, planning \nand designing of multifunctional and flexible solutions, \npublic participation and cost-benefit analysis.\n\nUsing this procedure helps to identify integrated flood \nresilience solutions. For example, one of the options for \na priority catchment area included the lowering of the \nlevel of a local lake to create a new cloudburst storage \nare. This option combines a blue-green and a grey \nsolution (i.e. use of pipes), resulting in an integrated and \nbalanced approach between infrastructure and green \nspace.\n\nSource: Oppla (2021a).\n\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n30 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 2.4  Example policy response: water retention reservoir in Podutik, Slovenia\n\nA flood reservoir in Podutik was redesigned into a multifunctional flood reservoir, resulting in a broad range of ecosystem \nservices being provided through the integration of nature-based solutions. Through a collaborative process involving a wide \nrange of stakeholders (i.e. local council, national government agencies, academics, private sector and local communities) \nthe project aimed to develop a new approach to water management and flood prevention. The Podutik reservoir follows \npolicy set out in the Seventh Environmental Action Programme (2014-2020), the Water Framework Directive and the Floods \nDirective. Establishing a multifunctional flood reservoir had two main objectives: firstly, to improve and maintain a good \necological status in the nearby watercourses and, secondly, to mitigate floods in the settlements near the city of Ljubljana.\n\nThe Podutik reservoir is an example of good practice, as it has led to multiple benefits, including an increase in local \nbiodiversity, the mitigation of water pollution and establishing a strong identity for the area. Among the key lessons for \nsuccessfully planning and implementing this policy response is the importance of an integrated approach to planning, as \nwell as strong engagement from stakeholders.\n\nSource: Oppla (2021b).\n\nBox 2.3  Example policy response: urban river restoration: a sustainable strategy for stormwater management in \nLodz, Poland\n\nDuring industrialisation, the majority of the many city's urban streams were canalised and transformed into culvert pipes, \ncontributing to an increase in surface run-off and in the speed of water outflow and causing frequent flooding in parts of \nthe city during storms.

This and other examples \npresented in this nexus highlight the potential for a range \nof co-benefits to accrue from adaptation interventions to \nbuild urban climate resilience. The selected assessment \nexample illustrates that, apart from reducing flood risk and \nurban overheating, NbS and GI can provide multiple social \n(e.g. health and QoL), environmental (e.g. biodiversity, \nreduced pollution, reduced urban heat island effect), climate \nmitigation (e.g. carbon sequestration) and economic (e.g. \nreduced energy consumption) benefits.\n\nThere is a need for a coherent policy framework and \nconsistency among the policy areas forming this nexus. One \nchallenge is that the EU has no formal authority for spatial \nplanning; however, in 1999, the EU Member State ministers \nresponsible for regional planning signed the European \nSpatial Development Perspective (ESDP) (EC, 1999). The ESDP \nhas influenced spatial planning policy in European regions \nand Member States and put the coordination of EU sectoral \npolicies on the political agenda. Actors such as the Covenant \nof Mayors for Climate & Energy also have an important \nrole in supporting cities to take a coordinated approach to \ntackling the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.\n\nCities are increasingly at the forefront of efforts to address \nclimate change in Europe. In practice, achieving climate \nresilience can prove challenging. Despite the interconnected \nnature of climate impacts, the planning and implementation \nof adaptation and/or mitigation measures tend to be \nconcentrated in one policy department (e.g. planning, \nenvironment). This can lead to undesirable trade-offs that \ncan further accelerate climate change. Developing a joint \nadaptation and mitigation plan in cities can help to address \nthe issue of trade-offs and identify and realise co-benefits. \nMainstreaming mitigation and adaptation into existing \nsectoral policies can also help ensure that synergies are \nidentified and represents an efficient and effective use of \navailable resources (Bertoldi et al., 2018).\n\nCrucial knowledge gaps and limited financial resources may \nrestrict\tcities'\tability\tto\ttake\tthe\tnecessary\tactions\t(Guan\tet\u00a0al.,\t\n2017). For example, the transport and building sectors are \nillustrative of the transformation required to achieve climate \nresilience. The development of climate-resilient infrastructure \nand measures to reduce GHG emissions requires huge \ninvestment. Thus, cities may need support from the EU and \nnational governments in the form of funding, capacity building, \nknowledge and data to support local adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures. New sources of finance may be available to cities, \nsuch\tas\tthrough\tthe\tNext\tGeneration\tEU\trecovery\tpackage\u00a0(11).\n\nEnsuring horizontal coordination of governance is important for \nclimate resilience in cities, as mitigation and adaptation policies \nmay be the responsibility of different departments in municipal \nauthorities and may require the cooperation of a wide range \nof stakeholders. Mitigation is dominated by a relatively small \nnumber of sectors (e.g. energy, transport) that often have \ngovernance oversight at a national level, or in large private \nsector companies. Adaptation tends to represent a broader \nmix of actors and sectors (e.g. water, health, biodiversity) and is \nmanaged more disparately, ranging from individuals to  \nnational agencies.\n\nThere is also a significant existing knowledge base available \nfor cities to help inform decision-making and action to achieve \nclimate resilience. For example, numerous studies have \nprovided the tools and data for identifying where the risks \nof flooding exist (e.g. Copernicus European Flood Awareness \nSystem\u00a0(12)). In addition, there are well-established cases  \nof how cities can mitigate and adapt to climate change  \n(e.g.\tClimate-ADAPT\tcase\tstudies\u00a0(13) and resources and \nsupport\tfrom\tthe\tCovenant\tof\tMayors\u00a0(14)). It is now up to the \ndecision-makers to take action and implement the necessary \nmeasures to enhance urban climate resilience.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance \nand urgency of cities building resilience to large shocks. The \ncrisis induced by COVID-19 has enabled cities to learn lessons \nfor increasing their resilience to climate change, as it has \nmany characteristics in common with climate impacts on \nsociety. For example, rapid emergence, global spread and a \ndisproportionate impact on vulnerable groups are some of the \ncharacteristics shared by both phenomena (EEA, 2020a). It is \nimportant that the negative economic impact of the pandemic \ndoes not distract or discourage local authorities from building \nresilience to climate change.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940\f\nClimate resilience nexus \n\n32 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n2.4 Existing networks and sources of information\n\nVarious networks of cities have been established to take \ncollective action against climate change.

However, there are \naspects\t(e.g.\u00a0physical\tand\tmental\thealth)\tthat\thave\tstagnated\t\nor worsened. The disproportionate exposure of lower \nsocio-economic groups to air pollution, noise and other \nnegative environmental impacts tends to affect urban areas \nmore than rural areas (EEA, 2018a). Addressing the challenges \nof inequality of opportunity and QoL is therefore of growing \nconcern\tfor\tmost\tEuropean\t\u00a0cities.\n\nThe European Commission recognises that the qualities of \nthe natural and physical environment are key determinants \nof QoL (Eurostat, 2016). Four out of five Europeans see \nenvironmental issues as having a direct effect on their daily \nlife and health (Eurobarometer, 2017). Previous work by the \nEEA has established environmental quality as a fundamental \nissue for social wellbeing and urban QoL (EEA, 2009).\n\nThe term QoL is widely used in the policy literature but lacks a \nclear and unambiguous definition. It can be highly subjective \nand dependent on people's individual circumstances \u2014 \nalthough there is a broad consensus that a good QoL is \na universal desire for almost everyone. A list of material \n(e.g. food, water and energy security) and non-material \ndimensions (e.g. equity, freedom of choice, enjoyment \nof natural beauty) have been proposed among existing \ndefinitions of and approaches to QoL. These dimensions \nalso explicitly link QoL to the natural world. Together they \ncontribute to achieving the inclusive goal of good quality of \nlife (IPBES, 2019).\n\nConversations around QoL in cities have long been \ndominated by international rankings such as the Economist \nIntelligence Unit 'Global Liveability Index'\u00a0(28) and the 'Mercer \nquality of living'\u00a0(29) city ranking. Such rankings tend to place a \ngreater emphasis on the economic and social aspects of life \nin cities. This has somewhat devalued the strong link between \nQoL in cities and the quality of the natural environment. \nResearch is increasingly highlighting that these two outcomes \nare inextricably linked (Stessens et al., 2020; Jones, 2021). \n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that a greater focus on urban \nenvironmental quality is key to developing policy responses that \naim to enhance liveability in cities.\n\nIf a better QoL is realised in cities, this is likely to support \nprogress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Sustainable buildings \u2014 through well-built, well-insulated \nand well-ventilated housing and improvements in the wider \nbuilt environment.\n\n\u2022 Urban accessibility \u2014 through the creation of safer and \nmore walkable streets and building high-quality efficient \npublic transport systems.\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through sufficient and \nbiodiversity-rich green spaces that are accessible to all.\n\n3.1.1 The quality of life nexus and the \nCOVID-19\u00a0pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social distancing and \nlockdown measures are having a substantial impact on a range \nof urban systems that have further affected people's QoL. The \nsignificant reduction in motorised traffic as a result of the travel \nrestrictions imposed across European cities initially led to a \ndrastic reduction in noise and air pollution levels (EEA, 2020b), \nalthough the easing of restrictions partially reversed this \npositive trend. For example, air pollution levels have rebounded \nin several European cities (e.g. Athens, London, Paris) driven by \nan increase in traffic and congestion (EEA, 2020c). To sustain \nthe positive impacts on QoL, longer-term recovery plans need \nto actively avoid a return to 'business as usual'. One of the \nmajor risks is an increase in private motorised traffic as people \ncontinue to avoid public transport. Ensuring that some of the \ninfrastructure changes that were put in place to encourage \nmore active travel (e.g. new segregated cycle lanes, wider \npavements, traffic calming measures) become permanent \nwill help to ensure a healthier and more sustainable mobility \nsystem in future.\n\n(28) https://www.eiu.com/topic/liveability\n(29) https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings\n\nhttps://www.eiu.com/topic/liveability\f\nQuality of life nexus \n\n36 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nThe local lockdowns also highlighted the link between \naccess to high-quality green spaces and QoL, especially \nfor those living in cramped housing conditions without \naccess to private outdoor space. During the lockdowns \npeople became more acquainted with their immediate \nneighbourhoods and local green spaces, and there is some \nevidence that this has led to an increased appreciation of \nthe importance of nature (Rousseau and Deschacht, 2020).\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated \nthe huge inequalities that persist when it comes European \nurban residents' QoL. Local lockdowns disproportionately \naffected the poorest urban residents, with ethnic, racial \nand religious minorities, migrants, elderly people, people \nwith disabilities and other marginalised groups particularly \naffected. Those with the lowest household incomes have \nbeen less able to work from home and also experienced \nmuch higher rates of unemployment. This has been \ncompounded by poor housing conditions, including higher \nexposure to air pollution, crowded living conditions, \npoor thermal insulation and no outdoor space, all of \nwhich increase the risk of COVID-19 infections (Ahmad \net al., 2020) while negatively affecting long-term QoL. To \nreverse some of the devastating impacts on the QoL of the \nmost vulnerable urban groups, recovery planning needs \nto understand and address existing social inequalities \nwithin local communities. This includes investing in better \nhousing, reducing air pollution and improving access to \nhigh-quality public green spaces and other urban amenities \nin\tlow-income\u00a0neighbourhoods.\n\n3.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nurban quality of life\n\nThere are many important policy areas that can contribute \nto achieving the urban QoL nexus. This nexus recognises the \nessential but often neglected role of the natural environment \nas our life support system and the way that it is integrated with \nthe built environment in cities. The QoL nexus therefore focuses \non the need for coordinated policy related to spatial planning, \nurban design, and nature and biodiversity (see Figure 3.1).\n\nTogether, the natural and built environments create \nconditions that either improve or worsen social, economic \nand cultural elements of QoL. The focus is in particular on \nbetter coordination of the nexus policy areas. The following \nsections explore some of the key challenges for urban QoL and \nhow coordinated action can improve it. An overview of these \nchallenges\tand\tactions\tto\taddress\tthem\tis\tprovided\tin\tTable\u00a03.1.\t\nIntegrating these policy areas could also have co-benefits, \nsuch as enhanced amenity value for people and increased \nbiodiversity. This nexus analysis also provides case studies \nillustrating good practice in European cities.\n\nThe assessment then discusses in more detail an example \nillustrating how coordinated action can contribute to QoL: \nincreasing access to green space through integrated land \nuse planning (Section 3.2.1). This was selected by viewing the \nnexus through the green city lens. Viewing the nexus from the \nperspective of different lenses may provide other entry points \ninto the wide-ranging and interdisciplinary policy challenge \nof achieving urban QoL. For example, viewing the QoL nexus \nthrough the inclusive city lens might identify actions to reduce \nthe inequality in people's access to green spaces.\n\nNature and\nbiodiversity\n\nUrban designSpatial planning\n\nExample challenge and action: \nIncreasing access to \ngreen space through \n\nintegrated land use planning\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve urban quality of life\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks \nsupporting quality of life\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \n\njustice\n\nEcological\nmultifunctionality\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nParticipation \nand\n\nempowerment\n\nPolicy interaction\nGreen\n\neconomy\n\nFigure 3.1 The quality of life nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\f\nQuality of life nexus \n\n37Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nChallenges of and actions for achieving urban  \nquality of life\n\nOne key challenge to successfully improve QoL in cities is \nassociated with the methodological issues in determining what \ngood QoL looks like. This is exacerbated by the heterogeneity \nof individual cities and individual's needs and desires. A \nEuropean Commission survey on perceptions of urban QoL \nshowed that satisfaction varied considerably both within cities \nacross different social groups and between European cities \n(EC, 2016a).\n\nWhile a universal definition of QoL may seem impossible, \nunderstanding the causal links between underlying common \nurban challenges (e.g. physical and mental health, pollution, \ncrime) and specific policy measures (e.g. implementation \nof green infrastructure, improved public space) can help to \nidentify transferable policy responses targeted at improving \nQoL. Some of these links are fairly well documented and \nalready have indicators to measure progress (e.g. the health \nimpacts of greater urban green space). Others are harder to \nmeasure and address because of feedback loops and indirect \ncosts (e.g. how the environmental impacts of individual \nhousing\tchoices\taffect\u00a0QoL).\n\nThe complex interaction between the many determinants of \nQoL means that efforts to promote one element can have \nunexpected impacts elsewhere. This is complicated by the \nfact that there is a tension between individual short term \nQoL improvements (e.g. private transport) and collective, \nlongerterm needs for sustainable development (e.g. reducing \ntraffic congestion) (EEA, 2009).\n\nThe trade-off between individual and community outcomes \nneeds to be addressed as part of any actions aiming to \npromote QoL in cities. This is why actions to improve QoL need \nto take a systemic view and consider distributional impacts. \nThe benefits of measures to improve QoL (e.g. increased green \nspace, improvements in the environment) always need to be \ncarefully monitored to ensure that trade-offs (e.g. increased \nproperty values and the resultant gentrification and social \ndisplacement) are taken into consideration (Wolch et al., 2014; \nMaantay and Maroko, 2018).\n\nAchieving satisfactory QoL in cities is also hindered by poor \nsectoral policy and governance integration at various scales \n(e.g. national, regional, local). This integration is essential to \nensure that QoL can be effectively mainstreamed into urban \ndecision-making processes including public and private \nstakeholders (e.g. developers, city government, citizens).\n\nThe benefits of urban life often go hand in hand with negative \noutcomes. These may include poor environmental quality and \n\npollution, lack of access to green space, congestion, crime and \ninequality that can affect the QoL of urban dwellers, including \ntheir physical and mental health (Eurostat, 2016; EEA, 2018a). \nAs QoL is a broad topic, there are a range of actions that could \nimprove QoL in cities. The specific policy measures will depend \non the current conditions in individual cities. The following \ntypes of action that are explicitly linked to the environment and \nsustainability could be considered to improve urban QoL:\n\n\u2022 Nature-based solution (NbS). According to the final action \nplan of the EU urban agenda Partnership for Sustainable \nLand Use and Nature-based Solutions, both sustainable \nland use and NbS can provide sufficient, efficient and \nbiodiversity-rich green spaces that enhance people's QoL. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the value of \ngreen areas for people's QoL. In addition, a city with more \ngreen and blue infrastructure will be less susceptible to the \nurban heat island effect and improve residents' thermal \ncomfort overall for during the warmer months.\n\n\u2022 Traffic reduction measures. Policies to reduce traffic in \ncities can play a significant role when it comes to improving \nQoL. Common measures include reducing speed limits, \nrestricting vehicles' access to certain areas or reallocating \nroad space to other uses. Such actions have the potential to \nreduce air pollution and noise and can also free up spaces \npreviously used by cars to increase green space, which \ncan increase urban biodiversity and climate resilience. \nAs shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, creating safer \nand more walkable streets, with more opportunities for \nexercising and socialising, can often have health and social \ncohesion co-benefits with far-reaching positive impacts on \nQoL. Given that poorer communities tend to be located \nnext to more major streets and urban highways, such \nmeasures also have the potential to address inequalities in \nhealth and well-being (Lee and Sener, 2016; Marshall and \nMcAndrews,\u00a02016).\n\n\u2022 Improvements in housing and the wider built \nenvironment. Most urban dwellers in Europe spend \naround 90\u00a0%\tof\ttheir\ttime\tindoors,\tmeaning\tthat\thousing\t\nquality is crucial to overall QoL (WHO Europe, 2014). The \nlockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \nhave further increased the time people spend indoors. \nWell-built, well-insulated and well-ventilated housing \nhas better indoor air quality, reduces exposure to noise, \nprotects against heat and cold and thus has tangible QoL \nbenefits while also reducing fuel poverty in low-income \nfamilies. Rooftops can be used for vegetation (reduces \nrun-off and risk of flooding) or for energy production, which \nimproves the overall resilience of the built environment \nand has long-term benefits for QoL (WHO Europe, 2014; \nStreimikiene, 2015; UK Green Building Council, 2016).\n\f\nQuality of life nexus \n\n38 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nTable 3.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving good urban quality of life \n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Methodological issues in defining and \nmeasuring QoL and determining what good \nQoL looks like.\n\n\u2022 The tensions between individual needs \nand short-term QoL improvements and \ndesires and collective, longer-term needs for \nsustainable development. \n\n\u2022 Understanding the clear causal links between specific policy actions and \nQoL improvements, e.g. by using established indicators to measure the \nhealth impacts of greater urban green space.\n\n\u2022 Taking a systemic view and considering distributional impacts when \nimplementing measures to improve QoL.\n\n\u2022 Poor sectoral policy and governance \nintegration hindering effective \nmainstreaming of QoL into urban \ndecision-making processes.\n\n\u2022 Defining a clear and measurable set of QoL indicators that can be used \nto assess urban policies to track improvement over time.\n\n\u2022 Complex interactions between many \ndeterminants of QoL mean that efforts \nto promote one element can result in \nunwanted/unexpected impacts on other \nQoL element(s). \n\n\u2022 Careful monitoring of any new measures to improve QoL to ensure that \ntrade-offs are carefully considered and the distributional impacts of \ndifferent policies on all sectors of society are considered.\n\n\u2022 Poor environmental quality (e.g. air, water, \nnoise) and lack of access to green space \nnegatively affecting physical and mental \nhealth of urban dwellers.\n\n\u2022 Excessive motorised traffic causing pollution, \ncommunity severance and discouraging safe \nactive travel options.\n\n\u2022 Housing and built environment \nquality that is not meeting the needs \nof residents, leading to high fuel \ncosts and an uncomfortable living or \nworking\u00a0environment.\n\n\u2022 Implementing NbS that provide biodiversity-rich green spaces that \nenhance people's QoL (see Section 3.2.1).\n\n\u2022 Implementing traffic reduction measures to reduce air and noise \npollution which have health and social cohesion co-benefits.\n\n\u2022 Improving housing and the wider built environment by insulating \nhousing, using sustainable heating/cooling sources that reduce air \npollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and using rooftops for \nvegetation, all of which have tangible health benefits while also reducing \nfuel poverty and improving resilience.\n\n3.2.1 Example assessment of interlinked actions: increasing access to green space through integrated land use \nplanning\n\nHow does increased access to green space through integrated land use planning fit within the quality of life \nnexus?\n\n\u2022 Access to high-quality green space has been reliably shown to improve people's satisfaction with where they live, \nwhile it is also linked to improved health outcomes and promoting physical activity, which in turn improves quality \nof life.\n\n\u2022 Land use planning that ensures that people of all income groups have access to green space can have a \ntransformative effect on quality of life, especially for low-income communities.\n\n\u2022 Improving green spaces has many co-benefits beyond the immediate amenity value it provides to people. It can \nenhance urban biodiversity, improve air quality, improve soundscapes, act as a carbon sink, reduce the urban heat \nisland effect and absorb stormwater.\n\f\nQuality of life nexus \n\n39Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nThis policy and action area focuses on the link between land \nuse planning and high-quality urban green spaces and their \nrole in mitigating the negative outcomes arising from living at \nhigher densities, and making compact cities attractive, safe and \nsustainable places to live.\n\nGreen areas in cities can fulfil a variety of functions, including \nfar-reaching economic, environmental and social benefits \nthat can enhance QoL. The challenge lies in identifying ways \nof introducing green space into cities without inadvertently \ncausing negative feedback loops associated with urban \ndispersal or gentrification. There may be inevitable trade-offs \nregarding green areas, although these will generally be \nrelatively minor. For example, when planning green areas \ncities should consider the economic costs of their maintenance \nand management. Trees and plants may have negative health \nimpacts arising from pollen, and their roots and branches may \ndamage roads and pavements. If not carefully planned and \nwell managed, these spaces may deteriorate in quality and \nbecome unsafe for users, thus undermining QoL. Perhaps \nmost importantly, there is always a trade-off when it comes \nto alternative land uses, and cities have to strike a balance \nbetween the benefits of green space and other urban uses.\n\nUrban expansion is still often falsely perceived as the best \npath to improving QoL by providing urban dwellers with \nmore affordable and greener places to live. Yet urban sprawl \nand the road building and increased transport demand that \naccompanies it can increase emissions and contribute to \nclimate change, and it also leads to further deterioration \nand fragmentation of natural areas. This results in reduced \nbiodiversity, loss of ecosystem services and loss of agricultural \nland (EEA, 2016c).\n\nAll of this has long-term impacts on the QoL of all Europeans, \nmeaning that uncontrolled urban expansion is incompatible \nwith a sustainable urban future. Living at higher densities \ncan be a solution, but it needs to be carefully planned and \nmanaged to ensure that it maximises the social, economic and \nenvironmental benefits without leading to more congestion, \npollution, exposure to noise and insufficient access to green \nspace for inner city residents (Bart, 2010).\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nMany European cities already have an existing urban fabric \nthat can be regenerated and reconfigured to increase access \nto green space. This can be achieved by using urban land use \nplanning tools that place a greater emphasis on promoting \ngreen space. Even in dense and relatively 'grey' cities such \nas Paris, significant improvements in access to green space \ncan be achieved. In recent years the city has demonstrated \nthis by pedestrianising and greening the banks of the Seine, \nconverting a disused railway line into an elevated linear forest, \n\nand installing 70\u00a0ha of new green infrastructure and rooftop \ngardens (C40 Cities, 2015).\n\nDespite this potential, 'green recycling' (whereby previously \ndeveloped grey infrastructure is redeveloped as green areas) \nremains\ta\tmarginal\tphenomenon.\tIt\taccounts\tfor\tonly\t0.2\u00a0%\tof\t\ntotal land consumption (EEA, 2018b). The EU aims to achieve \n'no net land take by 2050' in line with the United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals. Today, land recycling and \ndensification\taccount\tfor\tonly\t13\u00a0%\tof\tnew\tdevelopments,\tand\t\nland take continues to be a major challenge. Europe's urban \nplanners will need to play a key role in limiting urban expansion \nby designing integrated mobility and land use policies that \nallows sufficient space for green areas while also thinking about \nhow the wider green infrastructure network can connect green \nspaces both within and beyond individual cities (EEA, 2019b).\n\nIncreasingly, new developments are being planned so that \nthey include a sufficient amount of high-quality green space. \nAn increasing number of municipalities in Europe are using \nthe Green Space Factor (GSF) developed by the city of Malm\u00f6 \nto determine green infrastructure requirements for new \ndevelopments before planning permission is granted (Kruuse, \n2011). The GSF was adapted from the Berlin Biotope Area \nFactor, which is used as a guideline for new developments in \nthe German capital.\n\nAnother important strategy that can provide access to \nhigh-quality green spaces while significantly preserving natural \nenvironments is using urban containment boundaries. These \ncreate 'hard' edges between the city and the countryside to \nensure that development is not allowed to sprawl into intact \nnatural habitats (Schulze B\u00e4ing, 2010). This not only ensures \nthat existing natural spaces and biodiversity is preserved and \ncities' growth remains compact but also allows people access \nto wild areas in close proximity to the city. Urban containment \nboundaries have significant health and well-being benefits \nwhen compared with fragmented and artificial green areas \nassociated with suburban developments.\n\nPolicies that contain urban expansion and those that focus \non regenerating and greening existing brownfield sites can \nhave impacts on land values. This happens when certain \nareas are made more attractive to live in and space for new \nhousing developments is constrained. Cost of living is one of \nthe main factors that shapes QoL, and ensuring that people \nhave access to affordable housing is an essential component \nof this. Land use policies that promote biodiversity and green \nspace therefore need to carefully monitor how investment in \ngreening existing urban spaces affects low-income residents in \norder to avoid 'green' gentrification. Such policies should also \nensure that the benefits of green space are experienced by a \ndiverse range of people irrespective of their socio-economic \nbackground (Maantay and Maroko, 2018).\n\f\nQuality of life nexus \n\n40 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 3.1  Example policy response: a focus on compact development and green spaces to promote well-being in  \nLjubljana, Slovenia\n\nIn 2007 the city centre of Ljubljana was closed to all motorised traffic as part of an urban 'ecological zone' that today \ncovers more than 100\u00a0000\u00a0m2. Cycling and other forms of sustainable mobility are promoted in the zone and formerly \nderelict brownfield sites have been transformed into new green spaces.\n\nThe Ljubljana urban master plan, which forms part of the city's 2025 development vision, ensures that 83\u00a0%\tof new \ndevelopment will be focused on existing brownfield sites to preserve green spaces and regenerate the urban core in \norder to enhance the quality of life of local residents. An essential element of the city's strategy has been the ecological \nrestoration of the River Ljubljanica, including renovated river banks with improved vegetation to create new high quality \npublic spaces.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2016 the city created more than 90\u00a0ha of new public green areas on former brownfield or degraded \nland. (This, among other factors, led to its selection as European Green Capital in 2016.) Today, almost 75\u00a0%\tof the city \nsurface is green areas. 80\u00a0%\tof the green areas are on the outskirts of the city and are connected to the historical centre \nby green wedges and riparian corridors that link city centre parks and gardens. This includes a 34-km-long circular green \ncorridor popular for sports and leisure. Investments in urban gardening and urban beekeeping have further enhanced \nresidents' ability to connect with nature in meaningful ways while enhancing local biodiversity.\n\nSource: Oppla (2021c).\n\nBox 3.2  Example policy response: green ventilation corridors to address urban heat islands, air pollution and \nquality of life in Stuttgart, Germany\n\nStuttgart is a pioneer in using intelligent land use planning to protect and enhance the green spaces surrounding the \ncity. The city has developed green ventilation corridors and implemented construction bans in strategic locations to \nallow the winds from the surrounding hills to be channelled into the valley where the city lies. This helps to combat the \nurban heat island effect but also significantly improves local air quality and has had the co-benefit of protecting natural \nareas and enhancing local biodiversity. With the support of local climate maps (Climate Atlas) that inform the planning \nprocess, Stuttgart has stopped planned construction totalling 60\u00a0ha in recent years. On the basis of the Climate Atlas, the \ncity established an environmental office tasked with evaluating the effect of new buildings on the local climate and green \nspace. In addition, the following principles guide the planning process:\n\n\u2022 Green spaces are to surround buildings and larger interconnected green areas are to be protected and enhanced.\n\n\u2022 Valleys, hills and hillsides are not to be built up.\n\n\u2022 Urban sprawl is to be avoided.\n\n\u2022 All trees in the urban core over a certain size are protected.\n\n\u2022 Green roofs are subsidised (the city now has 300\u00a0000\u00a0m2 of green roofs).\n\nAs a result of these approaches, more than 60\u00a0%\tof Stuttgart's total land area is green space and more than 39\u00a0%\tis\t\nprotected \u2014 the highest percentage in any German city. The different green areas of the city have also been linked \nup, connecting the central royal gardens with the forests on the city's edges. Combined with investments to enhance \nbiodiversity, restore river systems and provide cycle paths and other leisure activities that allow people to actively use \nthese spaces, Stuttgart has considerably improved the quality of life of its residents.\n\nSource: Climate-ADAPT (2020b). \n\f\nQuality of life nexus \n\n41Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n3.3 Lessons for achieving good urban quality \nof life\n\nWhile individual cities may have achieved a high QoL for \nparts of their population, on the whole people's lifestyle \nchoices are still putting their future well-being and that of the \nnext generation at risk. It is important to find ways to align \ndemands for higher QoL with demands for a good-quality \nenvironment and a safe climate. From environmental and \nsustainability perspectives, implementing NbS, and also \nmeasures to reduce traffic and improve the quality of housing \nand the built environment, are examples of the actions that \npotentially address many challenges related to the QoL nexus.\n\nThinking about the way in which cities are planned and \ndesigned, and how the built environment and the natural \nenvironment interact, appears to be a good place to start. \nDeveloping policy responses integrated between spatial \nplanning, urban design, and nature and biodiversity is likely \nto significantly contribute to improved QoL within cities. To \nenhance the QoL, this sectoral integration should be guided by \nthe intention to enhance environmental quality as well as to \nachieve social equity and sustainability.\n\nMany of the relevant policy interventions that support QoL \nhave already been implemented in some cities. The question \nis how these successful approaches can be replicated and \nadjusted to different types and scales of sectoral and city \ngovernance and to specific city contexts (i.e. spatial, cultural, \ngeographical). To achieve transferable good practices, \nshort-term, sectoral and siloed governance approaches need \nto be transformed to facilitate more collaborative, integrated, \nholistic and long-term solutions. This would enable adequate \nresponses to the complexities associated with achieving \nequitable and sustainable QoL improvements (EEA, 2009). It \nappears that this is a shared European policy objective that \nhas the potential to incentivise true horizontal and vertical \nintegration in policymaking.\n\nNew technologies are likely to play an essential role when it \ncomes to ensuring that urban environments promote greater \nsatisfaction with life by being greener, healthier and more \naccessible places to live. However, in the post-pandemic \nworld changes in priorities at the individual, societal and \ngovernmental levels in relation to what constitutes a good \nQoL will be even more fundamental. This means addressing \nquestions of urban lifestyles and consumption patterns and \nimagining alternative urban futures in which we shift away \nfrom an individualistic perspective towards policies that \npromote good QoL for all.\n\nWhile exact definitions of QoL may differ between individuals, \ncities and countries, there are a number of commonalities. This \nsuggests that achieving good urban QoL would benefit from \nknowledge exchange between European cities and partnerships \nacross different levels of government, civil society and the \nprivate sector. It is therefore essential that the EU sets the \ncorrect framework conditions that provide cities with the tools \nto confidently tackle the challenges posed by the QoL nexus \nwithout compromising environmental objectives. This includes \ngood data and new indicators to measure QoL and allow cities \nto benchmark themselves against their peers.\n\n3.4 Existing networks and sources of \ninformation\n\nExisting networks and sources of information relevant to this \nnexus include:\n\n\u2022 Clever Cities \u2014 a Horizon 2020 project\u00a0(30).

Even so, \nmany European cities continue to confront major accessibility \nchallenges. This is because decades of transport and land use \nplanning have locked cities into prioritising a car-centric urban \ndevelopment model.\n\nMoving towards better urban accessibility is also increasingly \nseen as a fundamental precondition for a range of urban \nenvironmental sustainability objectives. It leads to reduced \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from transport, improved \nair quality, reduced noise, preservation of green space and \nreduced habitat fragmentation. This is because there is a \nstrong link between a more compact urban form and reduced \ntransport demand. Denser cities generally increase accessibility \nthrough proximity of urban functions and services, while \nreducing resource consumption and negative environmental \nimpacts (Rode et al., 2014). Studies have shown that higher \ndensities can reduce vehicle-kilometres travelled per capita by \n40\u00a0%\t(Ewing,\t2008).\tShorter\tdistances\talso\tencourage\tactive\t\ntravel such as walking and cycling, which has a positive impact \non health outcomes (Duncan and Kawachi, 2018).\n\nHigh-quality and efficient public transport systems are \nessential for improving urban accessibility. Traffic congestion \nremains a significant issue for all major EU cities, costing nearly \nEUR\u00a0100\u00a0billion,\tor\t1\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU's\tgross\tdomestic\tproduct\t(GDP)\t\nper year (EC, 2017). Yet to date only five European cities have \nintroduced congestion charging. Despite recent technological \nadvances in fuel efficiency and electric mobility, emissions from \ntransport\tacross\tEU\tMember\tStates\tactually\tincreased\tby\t28\u00a0%\t\nbetween 1990 and 2017 (EEA, 2018c). Across Europe, road \nsafety also continues to be a major challenge, with more than \ntwo thirds of all road accidents happening in urban areas. The \n\nexternal costs of road accidents in Europe have been estimated \nat\t1.7\u00a0%\tof\tGDP\t(EC,\t2018a).\n\nThe urban accessibility nexus recognises that enabling people \nto access work, education, shopping or leisure in an equitable \nand efficient manner is an essential component of economic \nand social development and one of the key reasons we have \ncities to begin with (Simpson, 2004; Duranton and Guerra, 2016; \nGutman and Tomer, 2016; Cervero et al., 2017; Rode, 2018).\n\nIf better urban accessibility is realised in cities, this is likely to \nsupport progress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through measures that reduce \ncar use and traffic and establish multifunctional green \nspaces that facilitate active transport and reduce air and \nnoise pollution.\n\n\u2022 Climate resilience \u2014 through the development of more \nsustainable transport systems and infrastructure that \nreduces or prevents greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u2022 Quality of life \u2014 by reducing the distances between urban \nservices, creating more liveable streets and improving \naccess to green space and other urban amenities.\n\n4.1.1 The urban accessibility nexus and the \nCOVID-19\u00a0pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nThe need for immediate social distancing measures to \ncontain the spread of the virus led to rapid changes in travel \nbehaviour in most cities, with far-reaching consequences \nfor urban accessibility. Public transport systems were either \npartially closed or operating at reduced capacity in many cities, \nespecially at the beginning of the pandemic. For many travellers \nreducing the risk of infection has become the main criterion for \nchoosing transport modes, overtaking even time to reach the \ndestination and the price of the trip in importance (McKinsey \nCenter for Future Mobility, 2020). As a result, many European \ncities saw a significant increase in the number of people \nwalking and cycling for leisure and as a means of transport. To \naccommodate these new sustainable travel behaviours, and to \nprevent an increase in private motor vehicle trips, many cities \n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n46 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nresponded with rapid infrastructure changes, including pop-up \nbicycle lanes, pavement widening and closing parts of the city \nto cars. For example, Paris built 50\u00a0km of temporary cycle lanes \nby taking space away from motor vehicles, whereas in Rome \nthe\tcreation\tof\t150\u00a0km\tof\tnew\tcycle\tlanes\thas\tbeen\tapproved\t \n(Zafra, 2020).\n\nThe reduction in economic activity and increase in the use of \nactive transport had an immediate and positive impact on \ncongestion and air quality in many cities across Europe (EEA, \n2020d), although, as lockdown restrictions were eased, some \nof these gains have been reversed. The drastic reduction \nin public transport use and the increase in operational \nexpenditure on additional health and hygiene measures has \nalso led to a collapse in revenue for many public transport \noperators (Lozzi et al., 2020). This has required central \ngovernment support to keep services running and potentially \nendangered the long-term sustainability of public transport \nnetworks in some cities. City governments quickly recognised \nthe importance of making public transport safe and attractive \neven during the pandemic. To restore passenger confidence \ncities have introduced new safety protocols, including cleaning \nsurfaces, requiring the wearing of face masks, installing \ndividers between passengers and drivers, and installing \ncontactless payment systems.\n\nA significant increase in home working (for people with \noffice-based jobs) also led to an overall reduction in travel \ndemand. The widespread adoption of technologies that \nfacilitate virtual connectivity may cause companies to rethink \nthe necessity of maintaining large and expensive inner-city \noffice space (Deloitte, 2020), and this may lead to people \nmoving further away from traditional employment centres. At \nthe same time, local travel increased in residential areas, as \npeople spent more time in their immediate neighbourhoods.\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nIn their pandemic recovery plans many cities have started \nto recognise that there can be no return to 'business as \nusual' and are proposing new strategies that are likely to \nfundamentally affect urban accessibility. These may include \ninvestment in active travel infrastructure; improved public \ntransport safety and accessibility; changes in traffic regulations \nto increase safety; and pricing policies such as congestion \ncharges to prevent an increase in car use. For example, Dublin \nstarted to develop a 'living' framework of mobility proposals \ntogether with the National Transport Authority. This plan \nproposes to provide additional space for pedestrian areas \nand safe cycling facilities. It also suggests implementing the \nvarious bus route changes that will be required to implement \n\ncycling and walking measures while maintaining a strong public \ntransport network (OECD, 2020).\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, many employers are looking at new \nways of operating. Working from home and shorter working \nweeks are both considered viable long-term options that could \nemerge as alternatives to a mass return to offices (BBC, 2020). \nIf proximity to one's job becomes less of a factor in deciding \nwhere to live for many office workers, it could lead to a shift in \ndemand for housing away from urban centres and traditional \ncommuter belts. This trend might be exacerbated by a growing \ndemand for bigger houses and access to private gardens. A \nlong-term decline in daily commuting and a preference for \nsuburban living could have significant implications for urban \neconomies and land use. For example, the high street retail \nsector might relocate closer to its more dispersed customer \nbase, which could lead to urban sprawl (Chait, 2020). A \nreduction in demand for centrally located office space may \nenable the construction of affordable housing in the inner \ncity, or at least provide opportunities for more mixed-use \ndevelopments. At the same time, an increase in e-commerce \nmay also lead to an erosion of 'bricks and mortar' stores, an \nincrease in urban freight movement and a potential loss of our \nvibrant high streets.\n\nThere is some evidence that the idea of a '15-minute city', in \nwhich people are able to meet all of their daily needs within a \nshort walk or cycle from their homes, is gaining some traction \namong policymakers. If prioritised in response to COVID-19, this \napproach could increase accessibility in a way that preserves \neconomic vitality and supports a low-carbon transition \n(Mart\u00ednez Euklidiadas, 2020). New global initiatives have also \nemerged to ensure a sustainable urban mobility transition \nas part of the recovery from the pandemic. For example, the \nTransformative Urban Mobility Initiative has developed the \navoid-shift-improve framework to implement a sustainable \nmobility in cities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  \n(TUMI, 2020).\n\nIn the longer-term, if there is an overall replacement of \nphysical connectivity with more virtual connectivity, this could \nlead to reductions in the need for travel, without necessarily \nsacrificing accessibility. However, the impact of these changes \nis likely to be unequally distributed across different population \ngroups, and cities will have to think very carefully about how \ntheir recovery policies can ensure that the most vulnerable \ngroups do not experience a decline in their ability to access \nurban opportunities. To help policymakers with the long-term \nsustainable mobility transition, a new foresight project, \n'European urban mobility 2050', supported by the EEA, will \nprovide the narratives that they need to make the transition in \nthe right direction.\n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n47Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n4.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nurban accessibility\n\nMoving towards better accessibility for all requires strong \ncross-sectoral collaboration across a range of policy domains. \nThis nexus focuses on coordination between transport policy \n(which determines the transport options available), spatial \nand land use planning (which determines where different \nresources are located within the city and relative to one \nanother) and housing policy (which determines questions \nof equity and inclusion) (Rode, 2018). Exploring the 'space' \nbetween these three policy areas in more detail should \nhelp to identify solutions that address accessibility while \noptimising integration and strengthening outcomes in each \narea (see Figure 4.1).\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges \nof and potential actions for achieving urban accessibility, \n\nconsidering in particular the need for coordination across \nthe selected policy areas. The overview of the challenges and \nactions to address them is provided in Table 4.1. We then \ndiscuss in more detail an example illustrating an integrated \napproach to addressing an accessibility challenge: using  \ntransit-oriented development to increase urban density \n(Section 4.2.1).\n\nThe assessment example was selected by viewing the nexus \nthrough the inclusive city lens. The nexus could be viewed \nfrom other perspectives, which would help to identify other \npotential areas of action. For example, viewing the urban \naccessibility nexus through a healthy city lens might lead to \nprioritising actions to reallocate road space and make non-car \ntransport modes safer and more available and attractive. \nThis would incentivise changes in travel behaviour that could \nimprove people's health and well-being while also having \nenvironmental\u00a0benefits.\n\nTransport Housing\n\nExample challenge and action: \nIncreasing urban density through\n\ntransit-oriented development (TOD)\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve urban accessibility\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\nKey building blocks \nsupporting urban \n\naccessibility\nPolicy interaction\n\nSpatial planning\n\n  \nSustainabl\ne mobility\n\nHousing \nquality\n\nParticipation and \nempowerment\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nFigure 4.1 The urban accessibility nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\nChallenges of and actions for achieving urban accessibility \n\nEuropean cities face the challenge of how to enhance mobility, \nensure accessibility to key urban opportunities, and create \nhigh-quality and efficient transport systems at the same time \nas reducing congestion, pollution and accidents. Although \naccessibility has been moving up the urban policy agenda for \nsome time, many cities continue to struggle to tackle these \ninterlinked policy areas comprehensively and move towards \naccessibility-based urban development. This is in large part \n\nbecause the traditional transport policy and land use model \nhas been unable to address, or has even exacerbated, these \nconcerns (Hajer and Kesselring, 1999; Vasconcellos, 2001; World \nBank, 2002; Litman, 2011). A legacy of outdated spatial and \ntransport planning models has locked cities into prioritising \ncar-centric urban development. Both existing infrastructure \nand existing urban form are likely to be shaped significantly by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Huge reductions in public transport \nuse, renewed investment in walking and cycling infrastructures \nand, at the same time, an increase in the use of private cars \n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n48 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nwill potentially have significant implications for environmental \nsustainability and land use change.\n\nTransport, housing and spatial planning at times function as \nseparate worlds, with their own institutions, disciplinary and \ncultural backgrounds, planning procedures and concepts \n(Rode et al., 2014). In most countries, dedicated transport \ndepartments remain responsible for administering transport \npolicies at national and local levels. These are often separate \nfrom spatial planning and housing policy, although their actions \ndirectly affect urban development. This siloed decision-making \nstructure and poor cross-sectoral integration of policy and \ngovernance (i.e. across different governance levels \u2014 national, \nregional, local) has led to wide-ranging socio-economic and \nenvironmental costs and challenges. These include urban \nsprawl, congestion, poor road safety and poor transport \nconnectivity (i.e. both within cities and between cities and \ntheir hinterlands). These challenges have undermined the \nsustainable growth of many European cities.\n\nPolicymakers recognise these impacts, but the narrow remit \nto simply anticipate and address demand often prevents them \nfrom considering the broader implications of their actions. Thus, \nin their efforts to facilitate movement, transport departments \nmay unwittingly make choices that reduce accessibility (Rode \net\u00a0al.,\t2019).\tA\tcommon\texample\tof\tthis\tis\ta\tfocus\ton\texpanding\t\nroad capacity and parking spaces to deal with increasing rates \nor motorised transport. Rather than alleviating congestion, \nsuch policies reduce accessibility for both car and non-car \nusers by increasing circulation rates and leading to more \ncongestion (Venter et al., 2019). Governance of accessibility has \na multi-level dimension, as cities do not function in isolation \nand are connected with their hinterlands. For cities to ensure \naccessibility for intercity commuters, freight, and national and \ninternational tourists, they will need to work with other scales \nof governance (e.g. supranational, national, regional). Better \nalignment of policy frameworks at different governance scales \nand across sectors is an important component of this process, \nas it can help to eliminate or at least mitigate unintended \nbarriers to urban accessibility. The cascading impacts of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted this, and travel \nrestrictions are having far-reaching consequences for cities.\n\nDefining the exact meaning of accessibility, and then measuring \nit accurately, is another challenge for policymakers. The high \nlevel of heterogeneity in cities means that accessibility is \noften unevenly distributed, something that was highlighted \nvery clearly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain groups are \nmore likely to experience accessibility-related disadvantages. \nLow-income groups, women, elderly and disabled people, and \n(more generally) households without a car are the most affected \nby a lack of access (Fol and Gallez, 2014). Questions of who has \naccess to opportunities, at what times and at what cost are \ntherefore an important additional component of ensuring that \naccessibility for all becomes the driving force of urban planning \npolicy. This requires agreement about what type of accessibility \nshould be promoted and how this access is distributed \n\nacross the wider population. Generally speaking, diversifying \ntransport modes as much as possible tends to ensure that the \ngreatest number of people can reach the greatest number of \ndestinations in ways that meet their needs.\n\nThere are many different policy interventions and governance \nreforms that can support a transition towards better urban \naccessibility. Transport policy reforms are an obvious place to \nstart. Tackling unsustainable trends in this sector requires a \nrecognition that car-based journeys in urban areas are generally \nthe least optimal. The logical consequence of this is therefore \nto shift resources away from cars and towards walking, cycling \nand public transport. With the emergence of the COVID-19 \npandemic, European cities have changed their priorities to \ninvest in active transport infrastructures and limit the number \nof journeys people take. An important way of maximising the \nimpact of such policies is to bring municipalities together to \ncoordinate transport across the wider metropolitan area  \n(Rode et al., 2019).\n\nThere are various interventions that can ensure more \nsustainable mobility, including:\n\n\u2022 imposing regulations that require compliance  \n(e.g. restrictions on parking, speed limits, \nlow-emission\t\u00a0zones);\n\n\u2022 creating economic incentives (e.g. road pricing, congestion \ncharging, budget support for public transport projects); \n\n\u2022 using information and service provision to encourage \nbehaviour change (e.g. public awareness campaigns, \nor guidance for local transport planners that promotes \naccessibility-focused approaches, bike sharing schemes, \npark and ride schemes, integrated mobility apps).\n\nAt the spatial planning level, a better spatial mix and \ndistribution of economic activities, services and amenities and \na focus on compact and mixed-use development can make \na major difference to accessibility. Housing tends to be most \nexpensive in the inner city (where accessibility to jobs and \nother services is highest), with low-income groups pushed \nto the outskirts, where housing is more affordable but the \nease of accessing employment and other opportunities may \nbe reduced. Transit-oriented development, whereby new \ndevelopments are clustered around existing (or new) bus routes \nor railway or metro lines, can play a major role in ensuring \ngreater accessibility for all.\n\nDevelopments in telecommunications and e-commerce may \nprogressively reduce the need for conventional transport \nand provide a different form of accessibility. The COVID-19 \npandemic has shown that homeworking is a viable alternative \nto office-based work for many people. As companies begin \nto rethink the need for office space in urban centres, this \ncould have a significant impact on land uses and existing \ntransport\u00a0networks.\n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n49Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n4.2.1 Example assessment of interlinked \nactions: increasing urban density through \ntransit\u2011oriented development\n\nTable 4.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving urban accessibility \n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Poor spatial, housing and transport planning \npractices including:\n\n\u2022 poor policy integration across sectors and \ndifferent governance levels (i.e. supranational, \nnational, regional, local).\n\n\u2022 lack of long-term planning and narrow focus on \ndirectly addressing demand rather than solving \nunderlying accessibility issues (e.g. expanding \nroad capacity rather than reducing road use).\n\n\u2022 legacy of outdated spatial, housing and \ntransport planning models. \n\n\u2022 Ensure better alignment of policy frameworks at different \ngovernance levels and across sectors to eliminate unintended \nbarriers to urban accessibility.\n\n\u2022 Ensure a better spatial mix and distribution of economic \nactivities, services and amenities at the spatial planning level \n(see Section 4.2.1).\n\n\u2022 Implement transport, housing and spatial planning policy \nreforms (regulatory, economic, information based) which \nrecognise that car-based journeys in urban areas are the \nleast\u00a0optimal.\n\n\u2022 Build and expand high-quality efficient public transport systems \nand infrastructure that promotes active travel.\n\n\u2022 Lack of understanding of the exact meaning of \naccessibility and how to measure it accurately.\n\n\u2022 Lack of recognition that certain groups are \nmore likely to experience accessibility-related \ndisadvantages and have different accessibility needs.\n\n\u2022 Develop clear metrics to measure progress towards accessibility \n(e.g. PTAL (public transport accessibility level).\n\n\u2022 Agree what type of accessibility should be promoted within \na city and how this access is distributed across the wider \npopulation.\n\n\u2022 Diversify transport modes as much as possible to ensure that \nthe greatest number of people can reach the greatest number \nof destinations in ways that meet their needs.\n\nHow does transit-oriented development fit within \nthe urban accessibility nexus?\n\n\u2022 Transit oriented development creates a strong \nlink between transport and land use planning \nby encouraging the clustering of jobs, housing \nand other services in relatively constrained areas \naround transit hubs.\n\n\u2022 Proximity to mass transit tends to lead to increases \nin land values around stations, which encourages \nhigher density development.\n\n\u2022 This concentration creates vibrant communities \nwith high-quality public areas and shorter \ncommuting distances \u2014 increasing access and \nmaking cities more liveable in the process.\n\nUrban density and mixed use tends to be strongly correlated \nwith greater accessibility. In this context, urban planning that \naims to reduce passenger travel demand is an important \ncomponent of accessibility-focused urban development \n(Ahlfeldt and Pietrostefani, 2019).\n\nUrban sprawl has increased rapidly in Europe in recent \ndecades. It is characterised by dispersed and segregated land \nuses. Urban areas have been expanding even in countries \nwhere the population has not been growing (EEA, 2016c). In \naddition to undermining accessibility objectives, urban sprawl \nis associated with a number of long-lasting and negative \necological, economic and social externalities. Some of these \ninclude the loss of fertile farmland, landscape fragmentation \nand higher infrastructure costs for transport and other services \n(C\u00e1rdenas Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015; EEA, 2016c; OECD, 2018). \nPoorly managed urban growth not only has severe negative \nconsequences, but it can also create 'lock-in', limiting options in \nthe future.\n\nWhile compact urban development has proven to have great \npotential for the sustainable growth of our cities, it is not \nwithout its detractors. If not carefully managed, greater urban \ndensities can lead to increased traffic congestion and air \n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n50 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\npollution, accelerate gentrification and increase house prices, \nthus exacerbating urban inequalities (Salat and Ollivier, 2017; \nDingil et al., 2018). It can also reduce access to urban green \nspaces, which are essential for human health and well-being \n(Kabisch et al., 2015), provide space for nature and have a role \nin managing climate risks. Liveable urban density therefore \nrelies on the concurrent development of excellent public and \nactive transport infrastructures, as well as social policies to \npre-empt the potentially detrimental effects of compact urban \ndevelopment. This will ensure that the benefits of greater \ndensity can be fully realised to enhance accessibility and quality \nof life for everyone.\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nThere is a range of policy responses that can promote urban \ndensity. Some of them include urban containment policies, \nsuch as green belts, minimum density requirements for new \ndevelopments and regenerating existing neighbourhoods \n(OECD, 2018). One of the policy interventions that has \nshown itself to provide significant social, economic and \nenvironmental co-benefits is transit-oriented development \n(TOD). TOD builds on well-established European precedents \nof concentrating urban development along railway lines, \nmetro routes and other public transport routes (e.g. trams, \n\nBox 4.1  Example policy response: regional transport and land use integration in the Randstad, the Netherlands\n\nThe Zuidvluegel (south wing) of the Randstad is one of the densest areas in Europe. The settlement structure is polycentric \nwith roughly 65 minor municipalities spread out over the area and two major cities, namely Rotterdam and The Hague. In \nthe early 2000s a transit-oriented development (TOD) strategy was developed called Stedenbaan (Cities Line). It focuses \non existing but underused railway stations, aiming to densify urban development around the stations and increasing \nlocal train frequency to facilitate this. In 2011, the Stedenbaan agreement was revised and extended to 47 cities. This new \nagreement,\tcalled\tStedenbaanPlus,\tset\tthe\tambitious\tgoal\tof\tbuilding\t80\u00a0%\tof\tnewdwellings\taround\tall\trailway\tstations\tand\t\nkey transit nodes, with a distinction between different types of stations, which correspond to different TOD solutions.\n\nStedenbaan is a slightly different approach to TOD, shifting the focus from the city to the region, involving stakeholders \nacross administrative sectors and levels, and creating cooperative rather than competitive relations between local \nmunicipalities. While the initial motivation was to unlock the economic potential of the wider region, there are significant \nenvironmental and social co-benefits and the project has allowed many municipalities to rethink their long-term urban \ndevelopment strategies.\n\nThe Stedenbaan approach may provide an interesting model for other cities in the EU, as a lot of European cities already \nhave significant rail infrastructure that is often underused either because of a lack of mixed-use developments in proximity \nto stations or because of insufficient service frequencies).\n\nSources: Balz and Schrijnen (2016); Staricco and Brovarone (2018).\n\nbuses). At its heart is the idea that transport, land use and \neconomic growth can all be managed more efficiently if \nplanned in an integrated way (Salat and Ollivier, 2017). This \nis because high-quality public transport and compact urban \ndevelopment mutually reinforce each other. Mass transit \ncan support the large passenger flows that come with \nhigh-density development, while the concentration of jobs \nand housing around stations helps make public transport \nfinancially viable.\n\nWell managed TOD measures can create important co-benefits \nbeyond mitigating urban sprawl and shaping more accessible \npolycentric cities. These include relieving congestion and \nshifting to more sustainable transport modes, improving air \nquality, boosting economic growth, improving the quality of \nplaces, and increasing physical activity levels (Gouldson et al., \n2018; Linton and Bray, 2019).\n\nThe following examples demonstrate that TOD can take \nmany different forms and can be adapted by cities to suit \ntheir context and needs. The transport infrastructure can be \nretrofitted to improve accessibility for existing high-density \ndevelopments. It can also be used to encourage  \ndensification around existing stations or to encourage  \nnew urban developments. \n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n51Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 4.2  Example policy response: using transit-oriented development to develop new neighbourhoods in \nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nCopenhagen is a pioneer of transit-oriented development, initiated in its 1947 Finger Plan, which designated five corridors \nof urban development along existing or planned suburban railway lines, which would be electrified to provide rapid rail \ntransit services to Copenhagen's central business district. Every station would be the focal point for high-density housing \nand contain local shopping facilities.\n\nBuilding on this legacy, Copenhagen started developing \u00d8restad new town on a strategic piece of reclaimed land owned \njointly by the city (55\u00a0%)\tand\tthe\tDanish\tgovernment\t(45\u00a0%).\tIn\t2000,\ta\tnew\tbridge\twas\tbuilt\tconnecting\tCopenhagen\tto\t\nMalm\u00f6 in Sweden. Leading up to this, the city identified the area between the city and the new bridge as suitable for \nhigh-density housing. \u00d8restad is designed to be highly accessible by public transport and bicycle. Car parking within \n\u00d8restad is restricted for both residents and visitors and is largely confined to multi-storey car parks. The \u00d8restad \nDevelopment Corporation created a masterplan and provided critical infrastructure, including the new Copenhagen metro, \nbefore selling plots along the line to developers. The finance captured from land sales was then used to pay for a significant \nchunk of the metro's development.\n\n\u00d8restad has helped to improve Copenhagen's international competitiveness by expanding its central business district and \ndeveloping highly accessible sites for office, media, retail and leisure activities. The large investment in mass transport \ninfrastructure in the central parts of Greater Copenhagen has increased its accessibility and encouraged commuting from \na much wider area, including more than 20\u00a0000 commuters a day from the Malm\u00f6 area. (This is an interesting example of a \ncase where better accessibility has led to an increase in overall transport demand, which will have to be studied further to \nsee if the benefits of greater accessibility outweigh the costs of the increased number of trips.)\n\nSources: Knowles (2012). \n\nBox 4.3  Example policy response: Vienna's Aspern Seestadt, a transport-oriented development area still  \nunder development\n\nWith the transformation of the former airfield Aspern, the city of Vienna plans to establish a new urban centre to the \neast of Vienna. The masterplan envisages the development of a multifunctional district with a mix of residential, office, \nscientific, research and educational uses. In 2028, 240\u00a0ha of land will be developed, accommodating around 20\u00a0000 \nresidents and a similar number of workplaces. Aspern Seestadt is expected to reduce the existing lack of jobs in the \neastern part of Vienna, resulting in considerable commuter flows into other districts of Vienna. The development of \nAspern Seestadt is accompanied by an integrated mobility strategy that seeks to transform the mobility patterns of \nincoming residents by prioritising walking, cycling and public transport. The new city district will be connected to Vienna's \npublic transport network and the wider metropolitan region through the metro, light rail and heavy rail, as well as the \ntram and bus networks. The new metro line was opened in October 2013, before the residential areas were developed. \nA management group has been established with the aim of maximising the attractiveness of streets and public spaces, \nin which a broad choice of shops, restaurants and other services are provided. The highest densities in Aspern Seestadt \nare to be found around the two metro stations. Aspern Seestadt can be considered both a single-node and a corridor \ntransit-oriented\u00a0development.\n\nSources: Nordregio (2016); Aspern Seestadt (2020). \n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n52 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n4.3 Lessons for achieving better \nurban\u00a0accessibility\n\nA key lesson for cities is that policies that explicitly aim to \nachieve better accessibility have the benefit of addressing \na multitude of interlinked urban challenges. These go far \nbeyond the environmental burden of excessive motorised \ntransport in cities and have the potential to fundamentally \nreconfigure how we live, work and interact with each other. \nImplementing transport policy reforms that promote walking, \ncycling, public transport and other forms of sustainable \nmobility can play an important role. However, these need to \nbe linked to spatial planning and housing policies to achieve \nreal urban accessibility. In order to be truly effective, questions \nof equity and social inclusion will have to be central to any \npolicy responses. This will ensure that a move towards greater \naccessibility does not come at the expense of the most \nvulnerable urban residents.\n\nLack of integration and collaboration across the different \ngovernance levels (i.e. national, regional, local) and policy \nsectors that characterise this nexus can lead to wide-ranging \nsocio-economic and environmental costs and challenges \n(e.g.\u00a0urban\tsprawl,\tcongestion,\tpoor\troad\tsafety)\tand\tcan\tbe\t\nan obstacle to accessibility-based planning. However, each \nsector's role is fairly well defined and differentiated, and \nthose sector-specific remits are robustly embedded into \nthe institutional frameworks of most countries (Rode et al., \n2019). Thus, while governments work towards integrating \nkey institutions and policies, they can already implement \nsector-specific actions to advance urban accessibility. This is \ngood news for cities, as it means that there are many actions \nthat do not have to wait for fundamental reforms to the \npolicymaking process or to existing institutional arrangements. \nThe extent to which city governments can effectively implement \naccessibility policies will depend on the specific institutional and \ngovernance context and the overall decision-making powers \nthat have been devolved to them. This can vary significantly \nfrom\tone\tEU\tcountry\tto\tthe\u00a0next.\n\nThe EU has significant limitations in developing policies on \nurban planning, since land use policies are mostly a national, \nregional or local competence. This presents a challenge for \nachieving greater policy coherence around accessibility at the \n\nEU level. At the same time, the EU can play an important role in \nseveral ways: for example, by developing clear standards and \nguidelines that focus on public transport access requirements \nfor new developments and that stipulate desirable urban \ndensities. The EU can also promote knowledge sharing \nand peer-to-peer exchange, which ensures that important \nlessons to promote urban accessibility are disseminated. \nAnother opportunity would be the development of mandatory \nsustainable urban mobility plans \u2014 already a requirement for \ncities in France and the United Kingdom. These new planning \ninstruments that consider accessibility are increasingly being \nmainstreamed into decision-making processes. However, cities \nare still learning how to use them effectively to ensure that \nthey meet the objectives of specific policy interventions.\n\nDefining and measuring accessibility currently presents a \nmajor barrier. It can mean different things to different people, \nand accessibility disadvantages are likely to affect some social \ngroups more than others. To ensure equity, city governments \nneed to agree what type of accessibility should be promoted \nand how this access should be distributed across society. \nAddressing the urban accessibility nexus might require \nnew cross-sectoral metrics, analysis and appraisal methods \nand the introduction of (as far as possible) standardised \nmeasurement indicators. These will have to acknowledge the \ndifference between transport-related terminologies that are \noften used interchangeably: for example, traffic (focus on \nlevel of service of roads and vehicle speeds), mobility (focus \non multi-modal, door-to-door movement), connectivity (focus \non ease of exchange between fixed locations) and accessibility \n(focus on travel costs and time to reach destinations) (Venter, \n2016; Litman, 2017). Finally, it will be critical to ensure \nthat new disruptive technologies \u2014 from automation to \nsmart\tmobility\u00a0\u2014\tenhance\turban\taccessibility\trather\tthan\t\nundermine it. This will require the creation of an agile \nregulatory environment that can respond proactively to these \nrapid\u00a0changes.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for \ncities to rethink their transport policies to change the focus \nfrom mobility to accessibility. By investing in TOD and active \ntransport infrastructure, cities can build resilience to future \npandemics while also ensuring significant environmental and \nhealth benefits\n\f\nUrban accessibility nexus \n\n53Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n4.4 Existing networks and sources \nof\u00a0information\n\nExamples of existing networks and sources information relevant \nto this nexus include:\n\n\u2022 Civitas (39) initiative.

In 2013 the European \nCommission introduced the clean air policy package to reduce \nthe health and environmental impacts of air pollution by 2030 \n(EC, 2019c). With the launch of the urban mobility package, the \nEuropean Commission reiterated measures to address these \nissues (EC, 2020a).\n\nHuman health is closely linked to the state of the environment. \nAlthough emissions of air pollutants have declined in recent \nyears,\talmost\t20\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU's\turban\tpopulation\tlives\tin\tareas\t\nwhere air pollutant concentrations exceed at least one EU air \nquality standard (EEA, 2019a). For example, approximately \n8\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU's\turban\tpopulation\tis\texposed\tto\tfine\tparticulate\t\nmatter (PM2.5) concentrations that exceed the EU limit value \n(EEA,\t2019c).\tUrban\tmobility\tcontributes\tas\tmuch\tas\t70\u00a0%\tof\t\nair pollutants (other than carbon dioxide, CO2) from transport \n(EC, 2019d). Noise pollution is also a major environmental \nhealth concern in cities, especially from road traffic (EEA, 2019d, \n2019e). For example, regular exposure to noise pollution can \ntrigger elevated blood pressure and heart attacks and causes \napproximately 12\u00a0000 premature deaths each year (EEA, 2019d, \n2019f). An estimated 82\u00a0million people in European cities are \nexposed to noise levels in excess of 55\u00a0dB\tfrom traffic during \nthe day-evening-night period (EEA, 2019d). Light pollution \nalso has impacts on the environment, for example disrupting \nphotosynthesis or the activities of insects and animals (Falchi \net al., 2011). More than 99\u00a0% of the EU population lives in areas \nwhere\tthe\tnight\tsky\tis\taffected\tby\tlight\tpollution\u00a0(47)\t(Falchi\tet\u00a0al.,\t\n2016). In urban areas it affects both flora and fauna as well as \nhuman health (Falchi et al., 2011; \u0160kvareninov\u00e1 et al., 2017; \nCoogan et al., 2020).\n\nExposure to environmental stressors differs between social \ngroups in cities. As a result, the health of some groups \n(e.g.\u00a0low-income\tgroups\tand\tethnic\tand\tracial\tminorities)\tis\t\nmore affected by the state of the urban environment than \n\nothers (Brulle et al., 2006; EEA, 2013, 2018a). This is because \nof the unequal distribution, quality and maintenance of \nurban infrastructures and services, such as transport \nsystems and high-quality green spaces (Barnes et al., 2018). \nFor these communities the risks are often exacerbated \nby factors such as unemployment and poor access to \nhealth\u00a0services.\n\nIn addition, the quality and accessibility of urban green \nspaces are considered important elements of healthy urban \ncommunities (Bertram et al., 2015; Edwards et al., 2018; EEA, \n2019f). These dimensions can be addressed through urban \ndesign and policies related to public transport, walking and \ncycling infrastructure. Together these can contribute to \nimprovements in environmental quality, human health and \nsocial equity and justice issues. Achieving high-quality urban \nenvironments that enhance health for all citizens should \nthus\tbe\ta\tpriority\tfor\turban\u00a0policymakers.\n\nIf environment and health is improved in cities, this is likely \nto support progress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Quality of life \u2014 through planning and measures to \nimprove green infrastructure (GI) and prioritise access \nand multifunctionality to enable active transport, social \nmeeting places, and the enhancement and maintenance \nof biodiversity.\n\n\u2022 Climate resilience \u2014 through the creation and \nenhancement of green areas that can incorporate \nmeasures to manage climate impacts and extreme \nweather events such as floods and heat waves.\n\nEnhanced environment and health can also contribute to \nother nexus outcomes, including 'food security', through \nthe creation and enhancement of GI that can provide \ncommunities with space to grow nutritious and healthy food, \nand 'urban accessibility', through urban design and policies \nto improve public transport and to provide walking and \ncycling infrastructure.\n\n(47)\t Light\tpollution\tis\tdefined\tas\twhen\tartificial\tbrightness\taccounts\tfor\tmore\tthan\t10\t%\tof\tthe\tnight's\tnatural\tlight.\n\f\nEnvironment and health nexus \n\n56 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n5.1.1 The environment and health nexus and the \nCOVID\u201119 pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of the \nenvironmental quality in cities for people's physical and mental \nhealth. For example, continued exposure to poor air quality \nleads to increased mortality risk from respiratory diseases \nsuch as COVID-19. The strict travel restrictions imposed across \nEuropean cities during the height of the lockdown led to a \nsignificant reduction in motorised traffic. This reduction had an \nimmediate and positive impact on air quality, with emissions \nfrom\tcars\tand\tmotorcycles\tfalling\tby\t88\u00a0%\tcompared\twith\t\npre-pandemic levels (EEA, 2020d; OECD, 2020). Concentrations \nof particulate matter (PM10) and PM2.5 across European cities \nwere variable and, where reductions in these pollutants were \nobserved, the decrease was less pronounced than that for \nnitrogen dioxide (NO2) (EEA, 2020e). Noise pollution was also \nreduced across many European cities. There are also reports \nthat wildlife was thriving during the height of the lockdowns, \nwith some species (e.g. wild bees) benefiting from the reduced \nair and noise pollution (Stokstad, 2020). However, the easing of \nsome COVID-19 restrictions in late summer 2020 saw air and \nnoise pollution levels rebound across European cities  \n(EEA, 2020c).\n\nAs a result of the ban on non-essential travel many cities \nexperienced a rapid decrease in tourist arrivals. Although this \nraised concern for local economies, it also resulted in reduced \nenvironmental pressures, including water pollution and impacts \non local habitats, in coastal tourism destinations.\n\nThe need for social distancing to reduce the risks of spreading \nCOVID-19 meant that public transport systems were closed or \nrun at limited capacity. This was mainly because of the health \nrisk posed by the confined space and resulting difficulty in social \ndistancing. To encourage more active travel and provide space \nfor social distancing many cities set up temporary cycling and \npedestrian infrastructure.\n\nDuring the pandemic, a huge increase in the use of personal \nprotective equipment has led to increased plastic pollution in \nthe environment. Individual choices during lockdowns are also \nincreasing plastic demand. Packaged take-away meals and \nhome-delivered groceries became increasingly popular during \nthe lockdowns. This puts extra pressure on regular waste \nmanagement services, potentially leading to inappropriate and \nillegal waste management strategies, including illegal dumping \nand local burning (Adyel, 2020).\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nThe pandemic has provided cities with an opportunity to \nreconsider mobility with an emphasis on active travel, \nimproved local environments and human health benefits. In \ntheir pandemic recovery plans many cities have proposed \nlong-term and permanent strategies including investments \nin an active mobility infrastructure; improved safety \nand accessibility of public transport; changes in traffic \nregulations to increase safety; and pricing policies such as \ncongestion charges.\n\nPublic green spaces should play a key role in the green \nrecovery. Local policymakers need to prioritise the provision \nof safe and accessible green space. It is especially essential \nin areas of deprivation or where there is poor or unequal \naccess to green space.\n\n5.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nenvironment and health in cities\n\nThere are many important policy areas that can contribute \nto improving the environment and human health in cities. \nGiven their relative importance for human health, this \nnexus focuses on the need for coordinated policy related to \ntransport, GI and the environment (Figure 5.1).\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges \nto achieving good environmental quality and health in \ncities and how coordinated action can improve it. Table 5.1 \nthen provides an overview of the challenges and actions to \naddress them. The assessment also discusses in more detail \nan example illustrating coordinated action: improving air \nquality through car-free cities (Section 5.2.1).\n\nThe assessment example was selected by viewing the nexus \nthrough the healthy city lens. The nexus could also be \nviewed from other perspectives, which would help identify \nother potential areas of action. For example, viewing the \nenvironment and health nexus from the inclusive city \nperspective might identify action related to community \ninvolvement in local schemes to improve environmental \nquality. This could involve establishing multifunctional \ngreen spaces that provide a range of health benefits, as \nwell as meeting other community needs such as providing \nmeeting spaces, facilities for leisure and active transport \nroutes.\n\f\nEnvironment and health nexus \n\n57Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nEnvironment\n\nTransportGreen infrastructure\n\nExample challenge and action: \nImproving air quality \nthrough car-free cities\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve improved environment \nand health in cities\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks supporting \nenvironment and health\n\nEnvironmental\nquality\n\nBuilt \nenvironment \n\nquality\n\nGreen and blue \ninfrastructure\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nParticipation \nand\n\nempowerment\n\nPolicy interaction\nSustainable \n\nmobility\n\nFigure 5.1 The environment and health nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\nChallenges of and action for achieving improved \nenvironment and health in cities\n\nImproving environment and health in cities is a \nmulti-dimensional challenge. It requires coordinating action \non air quality, mobility and access and the quantity and \nquality of green spaces among other things. However, cities \noften lack coordinated policy approaches that consider \nmobility, GI, and environmental and air quality together. At \nthe same time poor-quality urban design and form can limit \noptions for, or provide little space for, community activities, \ngreen space, biodiversity and active transport. The pandemic \nhas highlighted the need to focus on cross-cutting policy \napproaches that can deliver sustainable outcomes for each \nof these issues. This could include redesigning urban public \nand open spaces to improve GI and prioritise multiple uses \nand multifunctionality, including environmental quality and \nactive transport but also social meeting places and areas \nfor biodiversity conservation. Cities could implement these \nactions as part of their green recovery from the pandemic.\n\nSome research suggests that multifunctionality can \ncompensate for the quantitative lack of green areas in \ncompact cities (Haaland and van den Bosch, 2015). The Green \nSpace Factor is one way of determining GI requirements \nfor new developments (Kruuse, 2011; Massini and Smith, \n2018). It is used in the policies of many municipalities to \nset requirements that developers must agree to before \nplanning permission for a site is granted. The aim is to ensure \n\nthat, in creating places, GI is included in the planning at the \nearliest\u00a0stages.\n\nMany European cities experience high levels of congestion and \nassociated environmental health concerns, including air and \nnoise pollution. Well-established but unsustainable transport \npatterns and behaviours are common, including the dominance \nof motorised transport (especially cars) even for short journeys \nand commuting within urban areas. However, as highlighted by \nthe pandemic, urban areas have the highest potential to shift \nfrom motorised transport to more active modes of transport \nsuch as walking and cycling (Interreg Europe, 2019). Overcoming \nsuch challenges requires the coordination of policy and action \nin a range of areas. These outcomes can be realised through \nthe introduction of policies that reduce car use and traffic \nand promote active transport (e.g. improved frequency and \navailability of public transport, subsidised public transport and \nincentives for cyclists, reducing speed limits, restricting access \nand reallocating road space) to reduce air and noise pollution \n(see example assessment of interlinked actions in Section 5.2.1). \nPromoting teleworking and flexible working can also play a role \nby reducing the number of people commuting to work overall \nor during certain periods of the day. To some extent this has \nalready taken place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nas more people are working from home out of choice or \nfollowing national or local guidance. A shift to active transport \ncan have a range of co-benefits, contributing to improved \nhealth and reduced noise and emissions of air pollutants and \ngreenhouse\u00a0gases\t(GHG).\n\f\nEnvironment and health nexus \n\n58 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nCities often have high levels of social inequality. There is \nstrong evidence that vulnerable communities experience \nhigher rates of morbidity and mortality due to the cumulative \neffects of exposure to environmental stressors (EEA, 2018a). \nAt the same time access to and experience of GI significantly \ndiffers depending on socio-economic status. More deprived \npopulations also often have poorer access to and lower-quality \nGI in their vicinity than groups with higher incomes living \nin more affluent urban areas (EEA, 2010). Addressing this \ninequality in environment and health outcomes requires \nparticipatory working with community (including minority) \ngroups and citizens in deprived areas in order to understand \nthem and help to ensure that the needs of all are considered \nin planning and policymaking. Collaborative creation of policy \nand interventions with communities can also help to improve \noutcomes. The creation and enhancement of GI could also be \n\nfocused in areas with the lowest current levels of access, as \nwell as in areas of economic and social deprivation (recognising \nthat people living in these areas may also be less likely to have \naccess to private outdoor space and gardens). City governments \ncan better understand how deprived and minority groups \nare affected by environmental stressors by incorporating \ndeprivation and equality measures in spatial (mapping) of air \nand noise pollution, access to green space and active transport \nroutes, etc.\n\nThe policy actions taken to improve human health in cities can \nalso create a range of co-benefits that also contribute to this \ngoal (EEA, 2018a). For example, GI can be planned to contribute \nto climate resilience (e.g. by incorporating flood management) \nand food security (e.g. by providing space for communities to \ngrow food).\n\nTable 5.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving improved environment and health in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Lack of cross-cutting and coordinated \npolicy approaches that consider \nmobility, access, green space and air \nquality among others together.\n\n\u2022 Working across policy areas, in particular transport/mobility, land \nuse planning (especially for green space), nature/environment, \nair quality, health and equality to achieve coordinated outcomes \nand co-benefits.\n\n\u2022 Adapting existing policies to create co-benefits and improve \nhuman health in cities, e.g. GI can be planned to contribute to \nclimate resilience and food security.\n\n\u2022 Poor existing urban design and form, \nwhich limits options for or provides \nlittle space for active transport, \ncommunity and green space.\n\n\u2022 Redesigning urban form and space to improve GI and \nprioritise multiple uses, including environmental quality and \nactive transport but also social meeting places and areas for \nbiodiversity conservation.\n\n\u2022 Current unsustainable transport \npatterns, especially the dominance of \nmotorised transport (cars) even for \nshort journeys and commuting.\n\n\u2022 Existing infrastructure does not \nsupport or enable active travel.\n\n\u2022 Introducing policies that reduce car use/motorised traffic and \npromote active transport to reduce air and noise pollution (see \nSection 5.2.1).\n\n\u2022 Promoting teleworking to reduce the number of people \ncommuting during the busiest periods of the day.\n\n\u2022 High levels of social inequality: \nvulnerable communities, including \nethnic and racial minorities, \nexperience higher rates of morbidity \nand mortality due to the cumulative \neffects of exposure to environmental \nstressors; and more deprived \npopulations often have poorer access \nto and lower-quality GI in their vicinity \nthan groups with higher incomes.\n\n\u2022 Working with community groups and citizens to ensure that the \nneeds of all are considered and to collaboratively create policy \nand interventions.\n\n\u2022 Focusing action to create and enhance GI in areas of economic \nand social deprivation seeking to ensure equality of access in all \nareas of a city.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring monitoring of environmental drivers of health outcomes \n(e.g. air quality, noise, access to green space) also includes social \nand economic equality measures.\n\f\nEnvironment and health nexus \n\n59Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n5.2.1 Example assessment of interlinked actions: \nimproving air quality through car\u2011free cities\n\nHow does improving air quality through  \ncar-free cities fit within the urban health and  \nwell-being nexus?\n\n\u2022 Air quality is a key indicator of the health of a city, \nand air quality is typically poor in congested cities \nthat are not well planned and do not have ample \ngreen space.\n\n\u2022 Exposure to air pollution has an unequal impact on \nvulnerable citizens.\n\n\u2022 Car-free cities have co-benefits in addition to \nimproving human health and quality of life.\n\nOver 400\u00a0000 premature deaths each year in the EU are linked \nto air pollution (EEA, 2020f), and the health impact of road traffic \nemissions\talone\tcosts\tEUR\u00a067-80\tbillion\ta\tyear\t(CE\tDelft,\t2018).\t\nThe high population densities found in many cities exacerbate \nthese impacts (Wang and Moriarty, 2018). Thus, one of the \nbest overall 'indicators' of a healthy city is its air quality. Air \npollution levels are typically low in well-planned cities with good \ntransport systems, walkable streets and ample green space. In \ncontrast, air pollution levels soar in urban settings that prioritise \nroad transport over pedestrians and cyclists and that allow \nuncontrolled sprawl (WHO, 2018).\n\nNot all urban citizens are equally exposed and equally \nvulnerable to air pollution. The urban poor, elderly people \nand children are considered most vulnerable to air and noise \npollution, particularly in the southern and eastern regions \nof Europe, where exposure is highest (EEA, 2018d). These \nsocio-economic differences mirror unequal income and \nunemployment patterns. In Germany, for example, children \naged 3-14 years old from families of low social status more \nfrequently live next to main roads with heavy traffic, a pattern \nseen elsewhere in Europe. Consequently, they are worse \naffected by road traffic noise (11\u00a0%)\tthan\tchildren\tfrom\tfamilies\t\nof medium and high social status (3\u00a0%)\t(EEA,\t2013).\tCar-free\t\ncities have the potential to create multiple co-benefits for both \nthe environment and human health. Reducing traffic congestion \n\nin urban areas has had notable impacts on air quality. It can \nalso reduce GHG emissions such as CO2.\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nMost sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the \ncontrol of individuals. Addressing air pollution demands \nconcerted action by local, national and regional level \npolicymakers working in sectors such as transport, energy and \nurban planning (WHO, 2018). When cities take action to reduce \nair pollution, they can achieve good progress. Almost half of \nall cities monitoring air pollution in high-income countries \nreduced\tair\tpollution\tlevels\tby\t5\u00a0%\tbetween\t2008\tand\t2013\t\n(WHO, 2018).\n\nIn relation to transport, a wide portfolio of policies is needed \nto support car-free cities. These include improved frequency \nand availability of public transport, improved infrastructure for \ncyclists and pedestrians, shared car and bicycle programmes \nand access for emergency vehicles and delivery trucks. Cities \ncan provide incentives and build capacity among start-ups \nfor business and community-based innovation projects \nthat enable ride sharing or alternative modes of transport. \nHowever, policies must be carefully considered. The popularity \nof electric scooters in European cities has demonstrated \nthat some alternative forms of transport can raise both \nenvironmental and safety concerns (Tapper, 2019).\n\nSome cities have subsidised public transport, and others have \nestablished incentives for cyclists. For example, Portugal has \nestablished an e-bike subsidy scheme to encourage cycling in \nurban environments (Georgieva, 2019). However, initiatives \nthat promote car-free cities may be contested by businesses \nand interest groups that feel that it will create economic \ndisadvantages for a particular sector. Car-free cities may also \nbe opposed by those who are sceptical to policies aimed at \nreducing GHG emissions. An emphasis on co-benefits is thus \nimportant, and this includes human health (EEA, 2018d).\n\nAnother policy option is to promote teleworking, which \ninvolves working remotely and reducing the number of \npeople commuting during the busiest periods of the day. \nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation \nand Development's (OECD's) International Transport Forum \n(2019), the percentage of the population teleworking \nis highest in Denmark (34\u00a0%),\tFinland\t(32\u00a0%)\tand\tthe\t\nNetherlands (29\u00a0%).\n\f\nEnvironment and health nexus \n\n60 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 5.1  Example policy response: encouraging sustainable mobility habits to reduce air pollution in Cornell\u00e0 de \nLlobregat, Barcelona, Spain\n\nAir pollution is one of the main public health problems in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, where Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat \nis located. This issue is mainly caused by motorised traffic. In 2016, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat municipality, in collaboration with \nthe \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Barcelona, launched the Cornell\u00e0 Natura project, which has shaped the city's strategic plan for \n2016-2026. The project aims to increase and improve green areas in the municipality and encourage sustainable mobility \nhabits to improve urban liveability by 2026. It focuses on three main goals that provide the focus for all interventions:\n\n\u2022 achieve a green municipal infrastructure;\n\n\u2022 promote sustainable mobility;\n\n\u2022 improve environmental quality.\n\nMany of the actions promoted within the project are aimed at reducing air pollution levels and encouraging sustainable \nmobility habits. For example, these include reducing the speed limit to 20-30\u00a0km/h, traffic restrictions during weekends and \nthe expansion of the bicycle network. A key objective is to have more than 50\u00a0%\tof all journeys made on foot or by bicycle \nby\t2026,\twith\tpublic\ttransport\taccounting\tfor\tanother\t30\u00a0%.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation of some of the actions within the project. The initial \nlockdowns enabled the municipality to test closing streets to traffic and improving the public transport service. These \nmeasures have now been consolidated and new streets will be calmed by increasing the green infrastructure and creating \nmore space for pedestrians.\n\nSources: EC (2019c); Cornella de Llobregat municipality (2017). \n\nBox 5.3  Example policy response: a multi-pronged strategy to shift on transport use behaviour in Oslo, Norway\n\nOslo\thas\tsucceeded\tin\treducing\tthe\tnumber\tof\tits\tinhabitants\texposed\tto\thigh\tlevels\tof\tpollution\tfrom\t190\u00a0000\tto\t10\u00a0000\t\nsince 2015, and the city's emissions have decreased by over 20\u00a0%\tsince 2009. This has been achieved by adopting a multipronged strategy, firstly by encouraging the uptake of electric cars through reduced taxes, provision of charging stations, \nand free parking and travel on toll roads and public ferries for electric cars. In 2020 electric vehicles accounted for 22\u00a0%\tof \nthe total number of cars in the city.\n\nOslo City Council has also increased tolls for vehicles with diesel and gasoline engines, with 93\u00a0%\tof the toll revenue to be \nset aside for developing the public transport system. The sale of all fossil fuel-powered automobiles will be phased out by \n2025 in Norway. The centre of Oslo has also been redesigned by improving the infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, \nsupporting bike-sharing schemes and electric cargo bikes, increasing car parking fees, and introducing car-free zones in the \ncity centre.\n\nTogether, these measures and improvements have achieved a shift in transport behaviour. The council estimated that in \nlate\t2018\tthere\twere\tnearly\t500\u00a0000\tfewer\tcars\tentering\tOslo\teach\tmonth\tthan\tthere\twere\tin\t2017,\tand\tthe\taim\tis\tto\treduce\t\nvehicle traffic by one third and for all private cars to be emission free by 2030. Eventually, Oslo is aiming to make the \ntransition to a totally car-free city.\n\nHowever, there has been strong opposition to several of these initiatives, in particular increased tolls, with the emergence \nof a new political party to fight them and 43\u00a0%\tof the population feeling negative about them in 2020. This highlights the \nneed to consider carefully how car-free initiatives are implemented to avoid polarisation.\n\nSources: Oslo Kommune (2017, 2020, 2021a, 2021b); Klimaetaten (2020); Statens Vegvesen (2021). \n\f\nEnvironment and health nexus \n\n61Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 5.3  Example policy response: the role of \nexperimentation and evaluation in \nreducing urban traffic\n\nAutonomous vehicles have been promoted as a force \nfor people-centred design of transport systems. \nAccording to one estimate (Strategy&, 2017), almost \nhalf of all vehicle-kilometres in the EU could be \ntravelled in self-driving cars. Although promoted as an \nenvironmentally sound solution with considerable road \nsafety benefits, the consequences of automated vehicles \nare ambiguous and contested. For example, in 2019 \nthe Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment in \nNetherlands opened public roads to large-scale tests \nwith self-driving passenger cars and trucks. However, \ndespite their readiness in terms of policy and legislation, \ntechnology and innovation, infrastructure and consumer \nacceptance, the integration of autonomous driving has \nproven difficult in dense urban areas because of safety \nissues, perceptions and the strong cycling culture. As a \nresult, critics argue that autonomous vehicles will not \nbe a sustainable or acceptable solution in urban areas \nand will have to be kept separate from other transport \nmodes. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles may result \nin a rebound effect from the potential increase in their \nuse and the number of users. This case provides an \nexample of the importance of both experimentation \nand evaluation when it comes to interventions aiming to \nreduce urban traffic.\n\nSource: Government of the Netherlands (2021).\n\n5.3 Lessons for improving environment and \nhealth in cities\n\nWhile urbanisation has contributed to an overall decline \nin poverty (subsequently improving human health), some \nenvironmental challenges (e.g. air, noise, light pollution) put the \nhealth of people in cities at risk (Chen et al., 2019). As shown by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, a better understanding of the linkages, \ndynamics and complexities of urban environments is needed \n(InterAcademy Partnership, 2021). Policies must prioritise \nboth the health of people and the quality of the environment. \nRecognising the many potential co-benefits between improving \nenvironmental quality and improving human health, these \ntwo objectives can be considered intrinsically related and thus \nshould be considered together. Strategies for urban sustainable \ndevelopment must therefore recognise people as part of urban \nenvironmental systems.\n\nNational-level interventions (e.g. legislative frameworks) should \nencourage local authorities to integrate transport better within \n\ntheir health and environment policies (Flausch, 2016). Cities \nhave a key role in improving the environment and health \nthrough coordinated policy actions. Transport networks and \nGI are good examples of the complex sub-systems in cities \nthat interact with each other and significantly affect human \nhealth in positive and negative ways. Considering this example \nof interlinked issues, to maximise health outcomes local \nauthorities should develop and implement policy that reduces \nthe use of cars by enhancing public and active transport \noptions, including by creating multifunctional spaces and \nimproved GI.\n\nMany of the examples presented in this nexus depend on \ncollaboration across diverse stakeholder groups, in particular \nthose from deprived, low-income and minority groups who \nare often most exposed to environmental stressors (e.g. air \nand noise pollution) and have poor access to high-quality GI. \nThe articulation of co-benefits may be critical in reaching a \nconsensus. For example, there is considerable synergy between \nefforts to reduce air pollution and climate mitigation and \nadaptation measures (Wang and Moriarty, 2018).\n\nIn terms of indicators, those that capture the quality of \nhuman-environment connections can provide a good picture \nof human health in cities, especially when combined with \nindicators of deprivation and inequality. Good-quality urban \ngreen spaces can provide a restorative environment to mitigate \nthe impacts of urban stressors such as air and noise pollution \n(Payne and Bruce, 2019). When multiplied by the thousands \nof people who use it, green space can have a large positive \ncumulative public health impact (Gilbert, 2016). However, it \nalso should be noted that trees themselves can act as obstacles \nto airflow, decreasing air exchange and leading to large \nconcentrations of pollutants. It is important that urban planners \nconsider local meteorological conditions (e.g. wind direction \nand speed) and building layouts when developing tree-planting \npolicies to ensure substantial air quality improvements \n(Jeanjean et al., 2017). The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted \nthe urgency for cities to reimagine the way their infrastructure \nsupports environment and health for all. By investing in \ninfrastructure that encourages active transport and improves \naccess to green space, cities can contribute to a green recovery \nand achieve multiple co-benefits for both the environment and \nhuman health.\n\n5.4 Existing networks and sources  \nof information\n\nExamples of existing networks and sources information relevant \nto this nexus include:\n\n\u2022 C40 Cities\u00a0(48).

It also refers to the ability of a nation to \nprovide such access for its people, through its food production \nsystems, self-sufficiency and stable trade agreements \nand\u00a0networks.\n\nThe demand for food and evolving tastes (e.g. for out-of-season \nproduce) in cities has outgrown the supply capacity of their \nhinterlands. As a result, reliance on imported food continues \nto grow. Any disturbance (e.g. climate risks, food prices, \npandemics) to these supply chains could lead to social \ninequality in terms of access to affordable nutritious food \nin cities. Food security is an urban policy issue as much as a \nnational and rural one. Yet European policy to date has not had \na transformative effect on urban agriculture and food security, \nas it mainly views food production as a rural activity. Social \ninnovation and experimentation is rapidly emerging in cities. \nThis can range from community-supported agriculture schemes \nand farmers' markets to the creation of urban food policies. EU \nand national policies are often ill equipped to encourage this \ntype of experimentation. For example, food system initiatives \nin cities are ineligible for common agricultural policy funding \n(De\u00a0Schutter\tet\tal.,\t2019).\n\nFood security is critical to urban environmental sustainability. \nIt\tis\testimated\tthat\t80\u00a0%\tof\tEuropeans\twill\tlive\tin\tcities\tby\t\n2050,\tcompared\twith\t74\u00a0%\ttoday\t(EEA,\t2019a).\tThis\tmeans\t\nthat the demand for food in cities will increase. Larger urban \npopulations may lead to increased density and urban sprawl \nwith impacts on the availability of land for urban and peri-urban \nagriculture (EEA, 2016c). This will also have a negative effect on \nthe quality and quantity of biodiversity. Increasing awareness of \nenvironmental and sustainability issues among urban residents \nis also shaping the growing demand for new types and qualities \nof food. For example, the increasing number of people choosing \nto eat plant-based diets will have important implications for \nlivestock and agricultural production (EC, 2018b).\n\nEnhanced urban food security can reduce the environmental \nfootprint of the increased demand for food. It can also decrease \nreliance on external food provisioning systems and imports. \nBoth issues are critical within the context of climate change \nand any future pandemics. Access to and affordability of fresh, \n\nnutritious food for all urban citizens can be supported through \ndiverse and innovative forms of urban food production. It \ncould also be supported by reducing food waste and creating \ncloser relationships between urban residents and the food \nthey\u00a0consume.\n\nIf enhanced food security is achieved in cities, this can help to \nsupport progress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Quality of life \u2014 through ensuring access to healthy, fresh \nand affordable food for all to improve diet and health.\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through measures supporting \nurban food production and changes in people's diets \n(e.g.\u00a0towards\tmore\tplant-based\tdiets).\n\n\u2022 Closing the loop \u2014 through improving management of \nfood waste in households and service industries.\n\nEnhanced food security can also contribute to other nexus \noutcomes, including 'sustainable buildings', for example \nthrough the use of rooftops and balconies for food production.\n\n6.1.1 The food security nexus and the \nCOVID-19\u00a0pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response in cities\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased awareness of the nature \nand vulnerability of the food system and food production, \nsupply and distribution chains. The initial responses to \nCOVID-19 caused significant disruption to food systems, \nincluding those in urban areas. This posed several challenges, \nincluding rapid changes in food demand, availability, \naccessibility and affordability.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic many supermarket shelves \nacross European cities were empty as a result of spikes in \ndemand and a reliance on long and complex supply chains \nand just-in-time delivery. This meant, in the short term, that it \nwas not possible for supermarkets to restock quickly enough \nto meet demand. Closed borders, grounded planes, missing \nship containers and a reduced workforce led to disruption of \nsupply chains, particularly those for fresh produce (EC, 2020b). \nIn some communities and households there was a shift away \n\f\nFood security nexus \n\n66 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nfrom supermarkets towards local, small-scale provision of and \nself-sufficiency in certain goods and services, including food. \nThis has forced local food shops to adapt to increased demand.\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, more municipal and city authorities \nare realising the value of growing local, organic and more \nseasonal food (e.g. fruit and vegetables) in and around urban \nareas (EC, 2020c; IPES, 2020). For example, Paris is planning \nto move part of its food production more locally. The aim is to \nreduce the average distance travelled by food from producer \nto\tconsumer,\twhich\tis\tcurrently\t660\u00a0km.\tIn\tValencia\tthere\t\nare plans to use the urban green belt as an immediate and \ndirect source of fresh food for the city (OECD, 2020). There is \na risk that those from the lowest-income households will not \nbe able to afford locally grown and organic food, as it tends \nto be more expensive than food found in supermarkets. The \npandemic-induced economic recession is also likely to have an \nimpact on vulnerable households, further reducing their ability \nto purchase healthy, nutritious and locally grown food.\n\nIn their green recovery plans cities could plan for a diversity \nof green spaces, including urban agriculture. This could \nhave several co-benefits, for example increased biodiversity, \nreductions in the urban heat island effect and a reduced risk \nof flooding and soil erosion (OECD, 2020). However, there may \nalso be trade-offs with other land uses, such as for housing \nor commercial development. Achieving these co-benefits and \nlimiting trade-offs will require coordinated policy and action in \nrelation to urban agriculture, spatial planning and social policy.\n\n6.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nfood security in cities\n\nThe focus of the food security nexus is on achieving secure \nand sufficient access to food for the growing urban population \ntoday and in the future. Achieving food security for all requires \ncoordination between a range of policy areas. This nexus \nfocuses on coordination of policy and action in relation to \nurban food, waste management and spatial planning (see \nFigure 6.1).\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges \nof enhancing food security in cities and associated policy \nand practical actions. The focus is on better coordination of \nthe nexus policy areas. Table 6.1 then provides an overview \nof the challenges of and actions for addressing them. The \nassessment also discusses in more detail an example \nillustrating how coordinated action can contribute to food \nsecurity: promoting urban agriculture through small-scale \ninnovation projects (Section 6.2.1).\n\nThe assessment example was selected by viewing the nexus \nthrough the resilient city lens. The nexus could be viewed \nfrom other perspectives, which would help to identify other \npotential areas of action. For example, viewing the food \nsecurity nexus from the circular city perspective might \nidentify action related to stakeholder cooperation to reduce \nfood waste by applying circular economy principles. This \ncould include the wider adaptation of both composting and \nanaerobic digestion to divert bio-wastes from landfill and \nto ensure that nutrients and energy are recovered from \nfood\u00a0waste.\n\nUrban food\n\nWaste \nmanagementSpatial planning\n\nExample challenge and action: \nPromoting urban agriculture \n\nthrough small-scale \ninnovation projects\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve food security in cities\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks \nsupporting food security\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nGreen\neconomy\n\nParticipation \nand\n\nempowerment\n\nCollaborative \nand \n\ncommunity led \ninitiatives\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nSustainable \nurban\n\nagriculture\n\nResource\nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial use and \n\nzero waste\n\n  \n\nFigure 6.1 The food security nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\f\nFood security nexus \n\n67Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nChallenges of and actions for achieving food security \nin\u00a0cities\n\nClimate change impacts are already affecting food systems \nglobally. For example, droughts can trigger local food crises \nand have cascading systemic consequences such as spikes \nin international food prices (World Economic Forum, 2016). \nUrban areas are not immune to these impacts, and urban food \nsystems may have low resilience levels, in particular where \nclimate impacts coincide with pressures from a growing urban \npopulation.\tThe\tmain\telements\tof\turban\tfood\tsystems\t(e.g.\u00a0food\t\ndistribution and supply chains, transport and food storage) can \nall be affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the \nvulnerability of these elements, particularly of the production, \nsupply and distribution chains. Any significant disruption in \nthese elements will have implications for urban food security \nand the resilience of urban food systems (IUFN, 2016).\n\nGrowing urban populations and social disadvantage can \npresent\tadditional\tchallenges\tfor\tfood\tsecurity\t(Maggio\tet\u00a0al.,\t\n2015). Food security for all depends on sustainable and fair \nfood access and food pricing and collaboration across diverse \ngroups of stakeholders. This could include engaging the \nprivate sector (e.g. supermarkets, local convenience shops \nand food distributors), charities and non-governmental \norganisations\u00a0(NGOs),\tcommunity\tgroups\tand\turban\tresidents\t\nto understand food access challenges and to support or \nencourage the provision of affordable, healthy and fresh \nfood in deprived areas (Wang et al., 2018). Urban authorities \ncan also play a role in encouraging and supporting local food \ncooperatives and community shops in low-income communities \nand\tdeprived\u00a0areas.\n\nFood often plays an important cultural role in urban areas. It \ncan increase community cohesion and support the integration \nof new residents. For example, urban community gardening \nand farming projects can help new immigrants and refugees \nbuild social ties. It also enables them to celebrate and maintain \ntheir cultural traditions, as well as fostering resilience and \nboosting mental health (MacKenzie, 2016).\n\nVariations in import supply and availability, costs and quality \ncould be offset by increasing urban agricultural production. \nIt encompasses a wide range of practices, ranging from \nhousehold and community gardens to rooftop, vertical and \nindoor farms. By helping a city become partially self-sufficient, \nthese practices decrease reliance on external supplies. An \nEU briefing on urban agriculture in Europe uses case studies \nto assess its potential (McEldowney, 2017). For example, \n\nin Bologna, it is estimated that, if all rooftop gardens were \nused,\tthey\tcould\tprovide\tapproximately\t77\u00a0%\tof\tresidents'\t\nvegetable\u00a0needs.\n\nHigh levels of food waste and how to reduce it is a central \nchallenge for both urban sustainability and food security. It \nis estimated that approximately 88 million tonnes of food \nare lost along the supply chain or wasted at the household \nlevel\teach\tyear\tin\tthe\tEU,\tat\tan\tannual\tcost\tof\tEUR\u00a0143\t\nbillion (EU Fusions, 2016; EEA, 2019a). Innovative solutions \nfor the redistribution of surplus food supplies within urban \nareas are emerging. For example, social entrepreneurs use \ntechnology (e.g. donation-matching software) that provides \nreal-time information about available food. This enables \nlocal organisations to arrange efficient routes and pick up \nsmall amounts of food that otherwise would have been too \nexpensive to recover (Link, 2019). A growing number of cities \naround the world have committed to 'zero-waste' food systems \nthat aim, as part of a move to a more circular economy, to \nholistically integrate the food and waste sectors to increase \noverall resource efficiency. As part of this, there are new \nsystems for the diversion and reuse of food waste. For example, \nthe inedible fraction of wasted food is included in recycling \nprocesses in which it is converted into new products. Having \nbeen separated from the inedible fraction, the edible food \nfraction is reused in creative recipes or donated to people in \nneed (Pleissner, 2018). The European Commission and Member \nStates are committed to meeting the Sustainable Development \nGoal 12.3 target of halving per capita food waste at the retail \nand consumer level by 2030. They will also seek to reduce food \nlosses along the food production and supply chains (EC, 2019f, \n2021a). This will require policy action at national and EU levels \nto update existing legislation so that it enables and facilitates \nreducing food waste in European cities.\n\nPolicies related to urban land use and spatial planning can \nalso contribute to food security. Changing land uses can help \nto create new relationships between urban residents and \nfood production, consumption, nutrition and waste. Creating \nor allocating spaces for urban farming and new ways of \nexperiencing agricultural production can contribute to a sense \nof connection with food, which can lead to a reduction in food \nwaste, particularly if people feel that they have a stake in the \nproduction of food. Making food and the growing of food more \naccessible provides learning opportunities and creates spaces \nand platforms for new collaborations to emerge. Facilitating the \nparticipation and empowerment of stakeholders through land \nuse planning can therefore contribute to both food security and \ncommunity cohesion.\n\f\nFood security nexus \n\n68 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nTable 6.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving food security in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Low resilience of urban food systems \nto various impacts, including those \nfrom climate change and a growing \nurban\u00a0population.\n\n\u2022 Over-reliance on external food supplies.\n\n\u2022 Increase urban agricultural production using practices ranging from \nhousehold and community gardens to rooftop, vertical and indoor arms.\n\n\u2022 Establish initiatives to promote urban agriculture through small-scale \ninnovation projects (see Section 6.2.1).\n\n\u2022 Lack of fair access to nutritious food, \nparticularly among low-income \ncommunities.\n\n\u2022 Lack of understanding of how the values and \nattitudes of all stakeholders can influence \nboth the design and implementation of \nfood\u00a0systems.\n\n\u2022 Engage citizens and stakeholders in land use planning to ensure \nthat space is available for and communities are engaged in local \nfood-growing initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Promote urban community gardening and farming projects to, for \nexample, help new immigrants and refugees build social ties and \nincrease community cohesion.\n\n\u2022 Work with the private sector (e.g. supermarkets, local convenience \nshops, food distributors), NGOs/charities, community groups and \ncitizens to understand food access challenges and encourage the \nprovision of affordable, healthy and fresh food in all areas.\n\n\u2022 Encourage and support local food-cooperatives and community shops \nin low-income communities and deprived areas.\n\n\u2022 Reducing food waste. \u2022 Provide incentives for and build capacity among start-ups and \ncommunity-based innovation projects to reduce food waste.\n\n\u2022 Promote innovative solutions for the redistribution of surplus food \nsupplies within urban areas, including by using technology.\n\n6.2.1 Example assessment of interlinked actions: \npromoting urban agriculture through small\u2011scale \ninnovation projects\n\nHow does promoting urban agriculture through \nsmall-scale innovation projects fit within the urban \nfood security nexus?\n\n\u2022 Even in dense urban areas with limited green space, \nsmall-scale innovation projects can support food \nproduction with the right integrated approach and \npolicy and institutional set-up.\n\n\u2022 The development of urban agriculture requires \nsystems to support its development as part of \nwider circular economy and resiliency efforts.\n\n\u2022 Urban agriculture offers a range of co-benefits, \nincluding increased biodiversity, reductions in the \n'urban heat island effect' and a reduced risk of \nflooding and soil erosion.\n\nUrban agriculture faces several challenges, including:\n\n\u2022 pressure on open space and farmland;\n\n\u2022 barriers to cooperation with more traditional farmers;\n\n\u2022 the need for training and support for urban \nagricultural\t\u00a0entrepreneurs;\t\n\n\u2022 environmental constraints such as urban air and \nsoil\u00a0quality.\n\nAs part of an integrated approach to food security, human \nhealth, social and economic inclusion and environmental \nquality, there are various factors that influence the viability of \nexpanding urban agriculture. Some of these include the climate, \nexisting urban layout, attitudes towards the use of urban space \nfor food production, and the wider policy and institutional \nset-up. At the EU level, important barriers also remain in terms \nof how urban agriculture is defined and whether or not it falls \nunder the common agricultural policy. There is also ongoing \ndiscussion about whether or not it should qualify for funding \n\f\nFood security nexus \n\n69Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nthrough rural development programmes typically reserved for \nmore conventional agriculture (McEldowney, 2017).\n\nRecent research suggests that, globally, urban agriculture \ncould produce as much as 180 million tonnes of food a \nyear.\tThis\twould\trepresent\tup\tto\t10\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tglobal\toutput\t\nof legumes, roots and tubers, and vegetable crops (Clinton \net al., 2018). While there are no definitive figures on the \npercentage of food grown in urban areas across Europe, \nindividual case studies suggest a significant potential.\n\nThere are also environmental benefits associated with \nurban agriculture, for example increased biodiversity, \nreductions in the 'urban heat island effect' and a reduced \nrisk of flooding and soil erosion (Clintone et al., 2018). \nUrban agriculture does not require large amounts of land, \nas vacant plots or disused land can often be brought back \ninto use. However, there might be trade-offs with other \nland uses, such as for housing or business development \nas a result of increasing urban populations. It can also be \nintegrated into existing parks and private gardens. This can \nalso improve biodiversity and local amenity value. Even \nin dense urban areas with limited green space, rooftops \nor vertical structures can support food production. This \n\nBox 6.1  Example policy response: rooftop \nfarming in Rotterdam, the Netherlands\n\nThe DakAkker rooftop urban farm, one of Europe's \nlargest, is located on top of the Schieblock office \nbuilding in the centre of Rotterdam. It was set \nup in 2012 as part of Binder Groenprojecten in \ncollaboration with Environmental Centre Rotterdam. \nBinder Groenprojecten is a Rotterdam City Council \n'City Initiative' project, which has support from \nseveral business partners. The farm produces fruits, \nvegetables and herbs, and honey from its own hives, \nand functions as a test site for experimenting with \ndifferent ways of green roof farming in the city.\n\nIn addition, with 18.5\u00a0km2 of flat rooftops in \nRotterdam, the city has set a target of putting 1\u00a0km2 \nof that space to good use by 2030. This will include \ngreening the rooftops with plants and trees, adding \nsolar panels and using them for recreation or even \nhomes.\n\nSources: Rowling (2019); Luchtsingel (2021).\n\nBox 6.2  Example policy response: urban farming in \nBerlin, German\n\nTECF Farmsystems is a 1\u00a0800\u00a0m2 aquaponic start up in \nBerlin's central Sch\u00f6neberg district producing 30 tonnes \nof fish (tilapia) and 400\u00a0000 basil plants per year. The \nfounders have created a symbiotic system in which basil \nplants are grown from seed using nutrient-rich water \nfiltered from the fish-farming tanks by bacteria.\n\nThe system avoids the usual use of pesticides in \nproducing basil and antibiotics in producing fish. In \naddition, 90\u00a0%\tof water is reused. Shorter transport \nroutes for the fish and basil result in fresher food and \nlower emissions, especially because of the reduced need \nfor\trefrigeration.\tStart-up\tfinance\tof\tEUR\u00a01.4\tmillion\t\ncame from private investors and the Investitionsbank \nBerlin, a state-owned development bank. The business \nemploys three gardeners and two fish farmers and has a \ncontract to supply basil to the Rewe supermarket chain \nthroughout Germany.\n\nSource: Rosenbach (2019).\n\nrequires the right set-up and support from technologies \nsuch as hydroponics.\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nThere are growing opportunities for cities to provide incentives \nfor and build capacity among start-ups and community-based \nfood-related innovation projects. Many cities have set up their \nown systems to support the development of urban agriculture \nas part of wider circular economy and resiliency efforts (GIZ \nand ICLEI, 2014). One successful example is London's Capital \nGrowth network. It links more than 2\u00a0500 food-growing spaces \nin London. These range from small community and school \nfood-growing efforts to small-scale commercial urban farms. It \nis one of the largest and most established urban food growing \nnetworks in the world, offering training, support and practical \nhelp for community growing projects (Mayor of London, 2021). \nBased on an analysis of land use, Rome is the most agricultural \nmunicipality in Europe. One of the best urban agricultural \npractices there is the Agricoltura Nuova multifunctional \nagricultural cooperative. It occupies some 250\u00a0ha and is selling \nall its food directly to local markets. The cooperative is also \ninvolved in the social integration of marginalised individuals \n(Cavallo et al., 2016).\n\f\nFood security nexus \n\n70 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n6.3 Lessons for achieving food security in cities\n\nThe nexus analysis points to several key lessons for improving \nurban food security.\n\nUnderstanding how climate change will affect the various \ninterlinked elements of food systems should be built into all \npolicy decisions and actions. Food security is closely linked to \nurban climate resilience; thus, urban food production, land use \nand waste programmes must be aligned with urban adaptation \nstrategies.\n\nThere is also a need for structures and approaches that support \neffective and equitable collaboration between all stakeholders \nin the food system in urban areas and, where necessary, in \nthe wider food system. This includes policymakers, producers, \ndistributors, retailers and consumers, ideally involving the \ndifferent cultural groupings and age cohorts that make up \nurban populations. This is especially important in the context \nof rising numbers of immigrants and refugees in some urban \nareas. There is also a need for a better understanding of how \nthe values and attitudes of all stakeholders can influence both \nthe design and the implementation of food systems. This \nwould also help us to understand whether they are able to \ndeliver economically, socially and environmentally sustainable \noutcomes. Policies that consider the needs of all people as a \ncritical part of food systems can help optimise food security in \nurban areas.\n\nA shift towards more integrated perspectives on urban food \nsystems would require consideration of health and education \n\u2014 but also sectors and interests such as transport and \nlogistics, disaster and emergency management, urban food \nnetworks for the urban poor, food infrastructure and greening \nlocal economies (Dowding-Smith, 2013). For example, in the \n2013 Bonn Declaration of Mayors, city leaders committed to \n'holistic ecosystems-based approaches for city-region food \nsystems that ensure food security, contribute to urban poverty \neradication, protect and enhance local level biodiversity and \nthat are integrated in development plans that strengthen urban \nresilience and adaptation' (Mendle, 2015).\n\nThus, urban food security requires a cross-policy response, \ntouching on several EU policy areas. These include agriculture, \nfisheries and food, business, sustainable development, climate \naction, employment and social rights, energy and natural \nresources, environment, consumers and health, regions and \nlocal development, and science and technology.\n\nCities are already starting to work on food issues in a \ncomprehensive, interlinked way. There is growing recognition \n\nof the crucial role of (and opportunities for) urban authorities \nin the design and implementation of urban food policies. \nKey areas of focus include reconnecting food producers \nand consumers and involving different local stakeholders at \ndifferent scales to co-create innovative solutions (Magarini \net al., 2018). Strong urban-rural cooperation is important to \nensure continued access to food and land for farming. Land use \npolicies must be in place to manage an expansion of both urban \nfarming and peri-urban agriculture. The types of policy tools \navailable to cities to achieve this include citizen involvement \nand social innovation, innovative public procurement and \ncollaboration with research.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown how important it is for \ncities to take action to enhance food security by highlighting \nthe vulnerabilities of food production, supply and distribution \nchains. The pandemic has also highlighted the disproportionate \nimpact it has on food availability, accessibility, and affordability \nfor socially and economically disadvantaged groups. The \neconomic recession resulting from the pandemic is also likely \nto disproportionately affect these households, further reducing \ntheir ability to purchase healthy, nutritious and locally grown \nfood. As part of their green recovery planning, cities can \nhelp address food security by expanding urban agriculture, \nintroducing 'zero-waste' food systems and implementing \nmeasures that ensure accessible and affordable food for all.\n\n6.4 Existing networks and sources \nof \u00a0information\n\nExamples of existing networks and sources information relevant \nto this nexus include:\n\n\u2022 #reducefoodwaste\u00a0(62).

In 2020, on the back of the European Green Deal, \nthe Commission followed up by adopting 'A new circular \neconomy action plan for a cleaner and more competitive \nEurope' (EC, 2020d). The new urban agenda (UN, 2016) also \ncommits to sustainable resource management and the \ntransition to a circular economy. Partnership on a circular \neconomy is also one of 12 thematic partnerships under the \nurban agenda for the EU (EC, 2016b).\n\nClosing the loop refers to a circular model of resource \nmanagement. It means keeping products, materials, built assets \nand land in use while maintaining their value. It also means \nminimising waste generation.\n\nIt\tis\testimated\tthat\t80\u00a0%\tof\tEuropeans\twill\tlive\tin\tcities\tby\t2050,\t\ncompared\twith\t74\u00a0%\ttoday\t(EEA,\t2019a).\tAs\ta\tresult,\tmuch\tof\t\nEurope's production meets demand originating in cities as \nmajor consumers of resources and products. Cities have been \ncalled the 'engines of the [EU] economy' (Nabielek et al., 2016). \nThey represent distinct systems that can be transformed (EEA, \n2019a). Taking the example of land, at present, land recycling \nrepresents\tonly\t13\u00a0%\tof\turban\tland\tdevelopment.\tIncreasing\t\nthis amount would help achieve the EU target of no net land \ntake by 2050 (EEA, 2019a).\n\nUrban areas also depend on land and production outside \ntheir boundaries to meet resource needs and dispose of their \nwaste. This includes resources such as energy, water and food \nand the disposal of wastes, emissions and pollution (e.g. to air, \nwater) (EEA, 2017b). At the same time, many environmental \nand social problems associated with the linear economy are \nfocused in urban areas (e.g. unequal impacts of air pollution, \nclimate change impacts, local unemployment). Through \nimproved resource efficiency, closing the loop can 'decrease \nour reliance on imports and \u2026 reduce environmental pressures' \n(EEA,\u00a02019a),\tincluding\tin\tcities.\n\nCities can benefit from the circular economy and, given their \nenvironmental and economic importance, act as 'centres for \nchange' (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and ARUP, 2019).\n\nClosing the loop is a relatively high-level nexus topic. If a more \ncircular economy could be realised in cities, this would imply \nprogress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Sustainable buildings \u2014 through improved management \nof construction waste and resource and material use in \nconstruction (e.g. reuse), as well as by applying circularity \nprinciples in relation to the use of buildings and land \n(EEA,\u00a02019g,\t2020g).\n\n\u2022 Clean energy \u2014 through the development of more circular \nenergy systems, in which energy use is reduced, waste \nenergy is reused, and clean energy is generated on a small \nscale to meet local energy demands.\n\nClosing the loop in cities can also contribute to other nexus \noutcomes, including 'environment and health', through \nimproved resource management practices that reduce local \npollution; 'quality of life', through improved environmental \nquality and the provision of urban resource centres that can \nact as community hubs; and 'food security', through local food \ninitiatives to reduce food waste, which improve access to food.\n\n7.1.1 The closing the loop nexus and the \nCOVID-19\u00a0pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of supply chain \nresilience. At the height of the COVID-19-induced lockdowns \nmany businesses across European cities were affected \nbecause of their reliance on long and complex supply chains \nand just-in-time delivery. This has led to increased interest in \nlocal goods and services, which may support more circular \nproduction and consumption (e.g. making reusing packaging \neasier and encouraging industrial ecology). There is a risk of \nsocial impacts, however, as low-income households may be \nless able to afford locally sourced and produced goods because \nthey tend to be more expensive than those provided by global \nsupply chains.\n\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on various waste \nmanagement systems across European cities is still unclear. \nAt the height of the lockdowns local authorities and municipal \nwaste operators had to rapidly adapt their waste management \nsystems. Recycling systems have also been under increased \n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n74 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\npressure to continue providing services because of closure \nof recycling centres; an increase in home clearances; and an \nincrease in plastic waste from personal protective equipment, \ntake-away meals and home-delivered groceries. As noted in \nthe environment and health nexus (see Section 5.1.1), this puts \nextra pressure on regular waste management practices and \nmay lead to inappropriate and illegal waste disposal activities \n(Adyel, 2020).\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided cities with an opportunity \nto put the circular economy at the centre of a green recovery. \nBy designing out waste and keeping products and materials in \nuse, it could create opportunities for economic growth that also \nrestore the environment, create jobs and benefit society. To be \ninclusive, recovery planning needs to understand and address \nexisting social inequalities within local communities and ensure \nthat the needs of the most vulnerable are met.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, short supply chains may be considered \nmore favourably than before, as the reliance on international \nsupply chains may be seen as riskier than sourcing products \nand components locally. With support from city authorities \nthis could help accelerate the move to more circular local \n\neconomies. The pandemic has also significantly affected \nconsumer behaviour, as hoarding and panic buying became \nmore prevalent at the height of the lockdowns. The long-term \neffects on other aspects of consumer behaviour that affect \nthe circular economy remain unclear. For example, there may \nbe continued resistance to the concept of using products \nas a service and sharing of certain goods (because of real \nor perceived risks), which could undermine some efforts to \nencourage circularity.\n\n7.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nclosing the loop in cities\n\nClosing the loop implies moving to a more circular economy, \nwhich relates to a large range of policy areas. This nexus \nfocuses on the need for coordinated policy in cities related to \nresources and materials, waste management and the green \neconomy (see Figure 7.1).\n\nMany challenges to closing the loop result from a lack of \ncoordination between the three policy areas included in this \nnexus. For example, there is a risk that a waste policy that \nfocuses on landfill and incineration misses out on opportunities \nto grow the green economy by using waste as a resource. \n\nResources and\nmaterials\n\nGreen economyWaste\nmanagement\n\nExample challenge and action: \nReducing waste, encouraging reuse\n\nand boosting local economies \nthrough \u2018urban resource centres\u2019\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nclose the loop in cities\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks \nsupporting closing the loop\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nParticipation \nand \n\nempowerment\n\nGreen\neconomy\n\nResource\nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial use and \n\nzero waste\n\n  \n\nCollaborative \nand community \n\nled initiatives\n\nFigure 7.1 The closing the loop nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n75Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nIntegrating these policy areas could also have co-benefits, such \nas through reducing pollution and creating local employment.\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges of \nclosing the loop in cities and associated policy and practical \nactions. The focus is in particular on better coordination of \nthe nexus policy areas. Table 7.1 then provides an overview of \nthe challenges and actions to address them. The assessment \nalso discusses in more detail an example illustrating how \ncoordinated action can contribute to closing the loop: reducing \nwaste, encouraging reuse and boosting local economies \nthrough 'urban resource centres' (Section 7.2.1).\n\nThe assessment example was selected by viewing the nexus \nthrough the circular city lens. The nexus could be viewed \nfrom other perspectives, which would help to identify other \npotential areas of action. For example, viewing the closing the \nloop nexus from the inclusive city perspective might identify \naction related to community involvement in local schemes to \nreduce consumption, encourage reuse or reduce waste. This \ncould involve establishing local 'libraries of things' to support \nsharing of some household items, or community initiatives to \nreduce\u00a0food-waste.\n\nChallenges of and actions for closing the loop in cities\n\nCities do not exist in isolation. Challenges to closing the loop in \ncities relate to wider governance of the transition to a circular \neconomy and to city-level challenges. This nexus analysis \nfocuses on challenges and actions at the city scale. A further \nchallenge will be the scale of influence a city can have on the \ncircularity of systems outside its direct control (e.g. the food \nsystem). Nonetheless, cities have a role, and circular city and \ncity region initiatives are increasingly common in Europe \n(Gravagnuolo et al., 2019).\n\nA fundamental challenge is that many cities or city regions \nlack comprehensive strategies or roadmaps for circularity. \nThe urban agenda circular economy action plan (EC, 2018c) \nnotes that most cities currently view the circular economy as \nbeing about waste management and that there is a need for \ndetailed visions and strategies to move cities from urban waste \nmanagement to resource management. This could include \nfocusing on reuse, sharing and associated business models \nand on supporting businesses to help identify the value of \nwaste and by-products as secondary resources. Establishing \ncircular city strategic policy documents or roadmaps would \naddress this challenge. Such roadmaps should be based on \n\nan understanding of local and regional contexts. The circular \neconomy may look different in every city depending on local \nneeds and resources. Therefore, 'copy-pasting' solutions from \nelsewhere will not necessarily be effective.\n\nA shift to more sustainable consumption behaviours is \nneeded if efforts to achieve circularity are to be effective \n(Gravagnuolo et al., 2019). There is a need for participation \nof citizens and communities and for social innovation\u00a0(74). \nYet the social and behavioural side of closing the loop is 'not \nadequately addressed at the local level' (EC, 2018c). Cities \ncan address this challenge by engaging citizens, businesses \nand other stakeholders in setting strategy. They may also \nencourage cross-sectoral engagement and partnerships to \ncatalyse cross-sectoral action. Alongside more collaborative \nworking, cities can raise awareness and build capacity among \ncitizens and businesses. This can help them understand and \ntake advantage of the economic opportunities that a circular \neconomy can provide (e.g. new jobs, resource efficiency, which \ncan reduce costs, and supply security).\n\nAlongside improved strategic action, there is a need to combine \ngovernance approaches with new technical knowledge and \ncapacity. A range of actions could address this challenge, \nincluding setting up and working with networks to share \nscientific and applied knowledge in the field of the circular \neconomy and to strengthen a strategic coordinated approach. \nCities can also explore solutions to the complex problems \nassociated with the transition to a circular economy through \npractical experimentation (testing approaches) and innovation. \nBa\u010dov\u00e1\tet\tal.\t(2016)\trecommend\tthat\tcities\twill\tbenefit\tfrom\t\nstarting with small, experimental projects that can then be \nscaled up and translated into policy.\n\nThe way that waste and materials are managed in cities remains \na challenge, as:\n\n\u2022 There is limited focus in cities on waste prevention as \nthe highest priority, as it is 'rarely an integral part of local \nwaste management' (EC, 2018c). This means that holistic \napproaches to resource management are often missing, \nwith a focus instead on 'waste management' from the \nperspective of dealing with materials once they have \nbeen discarded. The focus should be on preventing waste \nby changing consumption habits (e.g. using products as \nservices, sharing products), encouraging repair and reuse \nand finding uses and value for waste as a resource (to the \nextent that cities can influence this).\n\n(74) Urbact's Social innovation in cities report defines social innovation as 'innovative solutions, new forms of organisation and new interactions to \ntackle social issues' (Urbact, 2015).\n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n76 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n\u2022 Recycling rates often remain low because of insufficient \nadministrative capacity; a lack of investment in separate \ncollection and recycling infrastructure; and limited use \nof economic instruments (e.g. pay-as-you-throw). Excess \ncapacity in the infrastructure for treating residual waste \n(e.g. through incineration) can also act as a barrier \n(EC,\u00a02018c),\twhich\trepresents\ta\ttechnological\tand\teconomic\t\nlock-in, in essence discouraging investment in waste \nprevention\u00a0measures.\n\n\u2022 There has been limited progress in closing the \nwaste-material loop: connecting consumer behaviours with \nwaste management practices while encouraging business \nto invest in and implement industrial ecology practices \nand make use of secondary raw materials (whose quality \nalso\tneeds\tto\tbe\tassured).\tOn\taverage\tonly\t10\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tEU\t\ndemand for raw materials is met by recycled materials (EC, \n2018d), although for some materials (e.g. copper, nickel) \nthis figure is over 30\u00a0%.\tA\tlack\tof\tdesignated\tfacilities\tto\t\nsupport waste prevention, reuse and repair, coupled with \nlow levels of information and knowledge among consumers \nabout repair and reuse services, also hamper more circular \nconsumption behaviours (EC, 2018c).\n\nOne specific action to overcome these challenges is for cities \nto work with communities, civil society or the private sector \nto set up consumer repair and reuse hubs (see Section 7.2.1). \nCities can also put in place local waste prevention plans, \nincluding long-term and short-term targets and provisions \nfor regular monitoring (Dri et al., 2018). To give a specific \nexample, the extended lifetime and delayed obsolescence \nof electronics is important for circularity. While the setting of \ndesign and labelling standards will need to be done at an EU or \nnational level, local (including city) authorities can support such \nstandards through public procurement strategy (EEA, 2020h).\n\nMajor disruptions in supply chains due to the COVID-19 \npandemic have highlighted the importance of keeping \nresources within the value chain, minimising waste and \nmaximising reuse and repair. This will require improved \ncollaboration among all stakeholders in the value chain \n(ETC/WMGE, 2019). For a city this may mean organisational \nrestructuring, infrastructure investment and training or \nupskilling of people working in waste management. The urban \nagenda circular economy action plan (EC, 2018c) states that \ncity authorities will need to gain more insight into resource use \ncharacteristics and resource flows by mapping resource flows \n(e.g. quantities, flow rates, owners, quality); access or develop \ntools and capacities to broker supply and demand of secondary \nresources and help markets for secondary resources to develop; \nand monitor progress towards resource efficiency in the city \nthrough the use of appropriate indicators. City authorities may \nalso have a role in encouraging industrial symbiosis and ecology. \nBusiness can be supported to integrate industrial wastes or \nby-products (e.g. heat, energy, water) into production processes. \nA\tspecific\texample\tis\tdescribed\tin\u00a0Box\u00a07.1.\t\n\nBox 7.1  Example of public-private collaboration to \nsupport industrial symbiosis: Kalundborg \nsymbiosis in Denmark\n\nThe Kalundborg symbiosis, established more than \n40\u00a0years\tago,\tis\tan\tindustrial\tsymbiosis,\tin\twhich\ta\t\nby-product or residual product of one enterprise is used \nas a resource by another. Through local collaboration, \npublic and private enterprises (both small and large) \nbuy and sell residual products from one another. The \nsuccess of this initiative has also led to the foundation \nof an industrial symbiosis centre, which seeks to identify \nand support similar initiatives in Denmark.\n\nThe reported benefits of the industrial symbiosis in \nKalundborg include:\n\n\u2022 cost reductions and reduced emissions;\n\n\u2022 growth with less resources consumed;\n\n\u2022 more competitive enterprises;\n\n\u2022 more resilient societies and enterprises.\n\nSource: State of Green (2017).\n\nCity authorities can also exercise their spending power through \npublic procurement. A city authority's position as a large \nconsumer can influence local markets and influence the use \nand flow of materials within the city. Cities can encourage \ncircularity through the uptake of EU green public procurement \ncriteria by (EC, 2016d):\n\n\u2022 setting standards and criteria for use in the procurement of \npublic goods and services; \n\n\u2022 guiding investment into physical development and asset \nmanagement;\n\n\u2022 holding funding competitions to encourage new ideas, \ncooperation and innovation;\n\n\u2022 focusing on areas where there is the most potential to \ninfluence the market.\n\nFor example the municipality of Almere (Netherlands) held a \ncompetition aimed at 'stimulating start-ups, companies and \nresearch institutes to develop business cases that not only \nintroduce innovative solutions for upcycling of waste flows but \nalso encourage collaboration to create a solid financial plan that \nmakes actual economic activity possible'.\n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n77Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nTable 7.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for closing the loop in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Lack of comprehensive strategies and \nroadmaps for circularity at the city or \ncity-region scale.\n\n\u2022 Establishing circular city strategic policy documents or roadmaps.

Closing the \nloop in cities will require citizens, as consumers of products \nand services, to make different choices that support a more \ncircular economy. However, the ways in which citizens can \nbe involved in this transition process is 'not adequately \naddressed' in cities (EC, 2018c). Furthermore, the European \nwaste hierarchy (Figure 7.2), has prevention as the highest \npriority. However, prevention is rarely integrated into local \nwaste strategies. There is also a lack of knowledge among \n\nconsumers and of access to facilities that support them in \nwaste prevention, reuse and repair (EC, 2018c).\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nTo enhance citizens' involvement in the circular economy, \none solution is to create designated multifunctional places \nwhere waste prevention, repair and reuse can be promoted \nand practised (EC, 2018c). The urban agenda circular economy \naction plan (EC, 2018c) refers to these places as urban resource \ncentres (Figure 7.3). They are physical spaces within a city that \nare easily accessed by the public. Such centres provide practical \nspace in which products and materials can be repaired and/or \nreused or repurposed. They can also perform a range of roles \nto\tpromote\tthe\tcircular\teconomy,\u00a0including:\n\n\u2022 providing facilities and space for private and community \nactivities, such as repair cafes and sharing food;\n\n\u2022 creating a place where citizens, businesses and other \nstakeholders can find information about waste prevention \ninitiatives, as well as a place for showcasing good practices;\n\n\u2022 acting as centres for small-scale, local entrepreneurship, \nwhich in turn can create jobs and support the local \neconomy and communities; involving non-governmental \norganisations (NGOs) and social entrepreneurs can help \nensure that marginalised groups are also included;\n\n\u2022 acting as incubators to provide space for new circular \nbusiness models to emerge and support the local circular \neconomy (EC, 2018c).\n\nA recent report by the Circular Economy Partnership of the \nurban agenda for the EU (EC, 2019g) identifies numerous \nexamples of urban resource centres in one form or another \n'popping up' all over European cities, representing the \ninnovative driver of cities striving for sustainable change at the \nlocal\tlevel.\tThe\treport\tpresents\t12\tcase\tstudies\tof\tgood\u00a0practice.\n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n79Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nFigure 7.2 The European waste hierarchy\n\nDisposal\n\nRecovery\n\nRecycling\n\nPreparing for re-use\n\nPrevention Product - non-waste\n\nWaste\n\nSource: Adapted from EC (2018c).\n\nIncubator\nCo-creation\nTransforming industrial sector\n\nURBAN\nRESOURCE\nCENTRES\n\nJob creation\nEngaging community\nQuality of life\n\nECONOMICAL FUNCTIONS\n\nSOCIAL FUNCTIONS\n\nWaste prevention\nWaste management\n2nd raw materials\n\nENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTIONS\n\n\u20ac\n\nFigure 7.3 Visualisation of urban resource centres' functions and benefits\n\nSource: EC (2019g).\n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n80 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 7.2  Example policy response: RLab in Porto,\u00a0Portugal\n\nTRLab\tis\ta\tcentre\tfor\tthe\trepair\tand\trecovery\tof\tWEEE\u00a0(waste\telectrical\tand\telectronic\tequipment),\tlocated\tin\tPorto\tand\t\nestablished in 2013.

The stations are located centrally (in densely populated areas \nand accessible in by walking and cycling). At the stations Oslo's city authority encourages people to participate in repair \nworkshops and sale and exchangedays, and promotes waste prevention activities and values through direct interaction \nwith local people (e.g. through workshops, meetings and seminars). The stations include space for people to leave items \nand also to take reusable items for free.\n\nIn some areas of the city the mini-stations are combined with other council services and local activities, and they have \nbecome 'social arenas' for local communities.\n\nThe mini-recycling stations have contributed to increasing the overall level of reuse in the city.

Many examples of such roadmaps \nexist, and a recent study for the European Economic and Social \nCommittee (EESC, 2019) identified 33 existing circular economy \nstrategies across 14 EU Member States, of which 17 were \nregional or local (including cities).\n\nOn the other hand implementing the circular economy \nrequires an understanding of the local context (such as existing \nindustries and materials flows) and quite specific, locally \nrelevant actions. In many ways cities are uniquely suited to such \nactions and changes and therefore are well placed to be leaders \nin the transition to a circular economy.\n\nClosing the loop in cities can boost local economies, create \nemployment and reduce the environmental and social \npressures associated with the linear economy. The closing the \nloop nexus highlights the importance of cooperation between \na wide range of sectors and types of stakeholder (e.g. public, \nprivate, community). Cities will need to develop partnerships \nand seek new ways of working involving collaboration across \npublic-private-social sectors. City authorities may need to act as \nfacilitators and brokers, bringing businesses and stakeholders \ntogether. As cities sit within a wider economic and regulatory \nstructure, the authorities may also need to work with EU, \nnational and international partners to explore and implement \nchanges needed to close the loop (e.g. in relation to value \nchains and fiscal measures).\n\nThe engagement of citizens is also key, as consumers of \ngoods and services are participants in the circular economy \n(e.g.\u00a0reusing\tor\trecycling).\tThe\tsocial\tand\tbehavioural\tside\t\nof closing the loop is considered to be 'not adequately \naddressed at the local level' (EC, 2018c). Addressing citizen \ninvolvement could include more collaborative working and the \nestablishment of consumer repair and reuse hubs. Such hubs \ncould also act as centres for capacity building for the circular \neconomy, for example skills for repair.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for industries \nto rethink and transform their supply chain models. Cities \nshould take advantage of this opportunity to accelerate the \ntransition to a circular economy. This transition could offer \ninvestment opportunities that contribute to ensuring a more \ncompetitive and greenpost-pandemic recovery.\n\n\u00a9 Bernard Hermant- on Unsplash\n\f\nClosing the loop nexus \n\n82 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n7.4 Existing networks and sources of \ninformation\n\nExamples of initiatives, existing networks and information \nsources relevant to the closing the loop nexus include:\n\n\u2022 EU urban agenda Circular Economy Partnership\u00a0(75). \nProvides a library of resources and news, including the \npartnership's action plan and associated studies prepared \nby it.\n\n\u2022 EuroCities\u00a0(76).

In 2019 the European \nParliament declared a climate emergency in Europe, part of \nthe response to which would include a rapid transition to clean \nenergy. In this declaration the Parliament urged the European \nCommission to address inconsistencies in current policies \nincluding those of energy and infrastructure investment. The \nEU also has an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. The \nEuropean Commission has identified this as 'one of the greatest \nchallenges of our time' (EC, 2019c). In 2016, the European \nCommission revised the EU's energy policy framework to \nfocus on the transition to clean and fair energy. As part of \nthis transition, the clean energy package for all Europeans \nincludes various elements related to the EU's targets to reduce \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (EC, 2019c). The Commission \nrefers to this as a 'new energy rulebook', which is fundamental \nto the implementation of the energy union strategy adopted in \n2015 (EC, 2015c). Supplying clean, affordable and secure energy \nis also one of the cornerstones of the European Green Deal  \n(EC, 2019b).\n\nClean energy generally refers to energy from renewable natural \nresources such as wind, water ('hydro'), sunlight, geothermal \nheat and tides. Clean energy sources make less impact on the \nenvironment throughout their life cycles than their conventional \ncounterparts (coal, petroleum, natural gas and nuclear energy). \nIn particular, clean energy leads to lower emissions of GHGs \nand other pollutants (Bouman, 2020).\n\nUrban areas are essential to transition to clean energy \nproduction and a carbon-neutral economy. They account for \n60-80\u00a0%\tof\tglobal\tenergy\tconsumption\tand\tsimilar\tshare\tof\t\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (IRENA, 2016; Sharifi et al., 2016; \nEC, 2021b). The projected increase in EU's urban population is \nlikely to lead to rising energy consumption. A significant factor \nin this is growing electricity demand due to the electrification of \ntransport, as well as the heating and cooling of buildings  \n(EC, 2019h).\n\nMeeting climate goals requires maximising the deployment of \nclean energy sources. In the light of the Paris Agreement on \nclimate change and the 2030 climate target plan proposed by \nthe European Commission, the EU has pledged to move further \nahead\tand\tachieve\tGHG\temission\treductions\tof\tat\tleast\t55\u00a0%\t\nby\t2030.\tIn\t2018,\trenewable\tenergy\taccounted\tfor\t18.9\u00a0%\tof\t\nenergy consumed in the EU-27 and the UK. This represented an \nincrease of over six percentage points in just a decade (Eurostat, \n2020). According to the International Renewable Energy Agency \nit\twould\tbe\tcost-effective\u00a0(84)\tfor\tthe\tEU\tto\tachieve\ta\t34\u00a0%\tshare\t\nof renewables in its energy mix by 2030. National- and city-level \ncommitments and implementation are essential to meet this \npotential (IRENA, 2018).\n\nIf more clean energy is produced in cities, this is likely to \nsupport progress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Climate resilience \u2014 through a reduction in energy-related \nGHG emissions achieved by using clean energy sources in \nwhich no fuels are combusted.\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through reduced air and water \npollution achieved by using clean energy sources.\n\nClean energy production in cities can also contribute to other \nnexus outcomes, including 'closing the loop', as clean energy is \nused to power the circular economy and is generated at a small \nscale to meet local energy demands; and 'sustainable buildings', \nthrough including clean energy sources in building design or \nretrofitting measures.\n\n8.1.1 The clean energy nexus and the \nCOVID-19\u00a0pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nThe EU energy sector witnessed a fall in energy demand and \nsupply amid the sharp reduction in air and road transport and \nindustrial activity. During the first quarter of 2020 the share of \n\n(84) See the definition of cost-effectiveness in Section 1.1.3.\n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n86 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nrenewables in EU energy production reached an all-time high, \nwith reduced generation from coal, gas and nuclear installations \n(IEA, 2020a). Although these trends indicated that the EU is \nlikely to meet its 2020 renewable energy target, the COVID-19 \npandemic slowed the progress of renewable energy projects \nin the first 6 months of 2020 (IEA, 2020b, 2020c). This trend \nhas also been seen in cities, where many urban homeowners \nhave been cancelling or postponing solar installations and \nrenovation projects. Delays in construction (e.g. due to supply \nchain disruption), lockdown measures and social distancing \nguidelines, as well as financing challenges, have largely been \nresponsible for the limited number of completed clean \nenergy\u00a0projects.\n\nAlthough the implementation of renewable energy installations \nacross European cities slowed in the first half of 2020, 'remote \nselling', using digital tools (e.g. Zoom, Microsoft Teams), became \na common practice during the lockdown. This has enabled \nleaders in the renewables market to educate potential clients \n(e.g. homeowners) on the benefits of renewable energy. It has \nalso allowed them to agree on a deal now and install the solar \npanels later (McElroy, 2020).\n\nThe pandemic has also had an impact on local authorities. The \neconomic challenges facing cities has negatively affected the \nfunds available for investing in clean energy. In particular, this \nhas affected decision-making, granting permits and adopting \nspatial planning arrangements that allow for the construction \nof renewable energy projects (McElroy, 2020). The full impact \nof the COVID-19 crisis on renewables is yet to become clear. \nHowever, there have been encouraging developments, as the \nindustry has been adapting quickly. Since June 2020 renewables \nhave seen growth in the monthly additions to capacity, \npointing to a faster than expected recovery in Europe. Globally, \nrenewables\taccounted\tfor\talmost\t90\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tincrease\tin\ttotal\t\npower capacity in 2020 and are set to become the largest \nsource of electricity generation in 2025 (IEA, 2020c).\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nIn their green recovery plans cities acknowledge the need for \ninvestments in clean energy to reinvigorate local economies. \nFor example, the mayors of the C40 Cities network have \nlaunched a green and just COVID-19 recovery plan. One of the \nkey actions proposed in this plan is to invest in urban renewable \nenergy programmes (C40 Cities, 2020a). The Next Generation \n\nEU recovery package is also prioritising investment in cleaner \ntechnologies, including those for energy. The green recovery \ninvestment in clean energy sources can also provide good \nvalue for money. For example, financing solar photovoltaic \n(PV) and wind energy installations ensure relatively quick \ndelivery and provide immediate environmental gains. In \naddition, both of these sources are among the cheapest \noptions for new generation of clean energy and have relatively \nshort\tinvestment\u00a0cycles.\n\nThe impact on local energy initiatives will depend on cities' \napproach to recovery. City governments choosing to focus \non community-based recovery, self-sufficiency and the social \neconomy could lead to increased interest in community \nenergy\u00a0schemes.\n\n8.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nthe clean energy transition in cities\n\nSupporting a clean energy transition in cities will require \naction across a range of policy areas. This nexus focuses on \nthe need for coordinated policy and action in cities related to \nspatial planning, the built environment and energy  \n(see Figure 8.1).\n\nA lack of coordination between these three policy areas will \nundermine efforts to increase clean energy production in \ncities. For example, city governments will need to ensure \nthat spatial planning and built environment policies consider \nthe land use and infrastructure needs of new clean energy \nproduction\tand\u00a0transmission.\n\nIntegrating these policy areas can also have co-benefits. For \nexample, clean energy reduces carbon emissions and helps \nmitigate climate change. It can also reduce air and water \npollution, resulting in benefits for the environment and human \nhealth (EEA, 2017c). The geographical spread and modular \ndesign of some renewable energy sources (e.g. wind, solar) \ncan also enhance energy resilience: for example, resilience to \nsevere weather events as a result of being less dependent on \none large energy production source; to cyberattacks on the \noperating systems that control large power stations as a result \nof using small-scale operating systems; and to power outages \nas a result of being less vulnerable to large-scale failure. \nThe continuity of clean energy supply can help ensure that \nessential services in cities are not disrupted (IRENA, 2019).\n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n87Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBuilt\nenvironment\n\nEnergySpatial planning\n\nExample challenge and action: \nDecentralised energy production \n\nby clean energy sources\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve clean energy transition\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks \nsupporting clean energy\n\nRenewable \nenergy\n\nCollaborative \nand community \n\nled initiatives\n\nPolicy interaction\nBuilt environment \n\nquality\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\nParticipation \nand\n\nempowerment\n\n  \n\nFigure 8.1 The clean energy nexus: key policy areas and building blocks\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges of \nachieving clean energy transitions in cities and associated policy \nand practical actions. The focus is in particular on improved \ncoordination\tbetween\tthe\tnexus\tpolicy\tareas.\tTable\u00a08.1\t\nthen provides an overview of the challenges and actions to \naddress them. The assessment also discusses in more detail \nan example illustrating an interlinked area of policy and action \nrelevant to cities: decentralised energy production by clean \nenergy sources (Section 8.2.1). The assessment example was \nselected by viewing the nexus through the low-carbon city lens. \nOther examples of interlinked policy and action in this nexus \ncould\t\u00a0include:\n\n\u2022 ensuring that built environment policies consider the \nphysical infrastructure and technological challenges of \ncleaner energy (e.g. availability of transmission lines);\n\n\u2022 integrating energy policy with spatial planning and policies \nfor the built environment to ensure that sufficient space is \navailable for the clean energy infrastructure;\n\n\u2022 ensuring that energy policy supports partnerships \n(e.g.\u00a0public-private)\tand\tcommunity-led\tenergy\tinitiatives\tto\t\nhelp achieve a just transition to cleaner energy.\n\nThis nexus could be viewed from other perspectives, which \nwould help to identify other potential areas for action. For \nexample, viewing the clean energy nexus through the inclusive \ncity lens might identify actions to enable all citizens to benefit \nfrom the transition to clean energy production (ensuring a \njust transition). It would also be important to consider how \nthe transition to clean energy might affect the affordability of \nenergy, especially for those in low-income groups.\n\nChallenges of and actions for achieving clean energy \nin\u00a0cities\n\nCities transitioning to clean energy and carbon neutrality \nimplies a structural change in energy production, moving away \nfrom fossil fuels. Broadly this could be achieved in two ways. \nCities could replace existing large energy plants with clean \nenergy alternatives. Alternatively, cities could replace existing \nlarge plants with a more decentralised approach to power \ngeneration, in which there are many local producers of clean \nenergy. A combination of these two approaches could also \nbe\u00a0used.\n\nWhichever route to clean energy is chosen, cities face a \nrange of complex challenges in decarbonising their energy \nproduction. The transition to clean energy may be hindered by \nbureaucracy and regulatory requirements. Planning restrictions \nand associated delays in the installation of clean energy \ninfrastructure is an example of the administrative hurdles that \ncan be encountered. A lack of coordination between different \nauthorities and long lead times in obtaining authorisation \nfurther impact the clean energy transition (Richardson, \n2019). Reducing administrative and regulatory hurdles could \nencourage new clean energy producers to enter the market \n(IRENA, 2016).\n\nThe installation of clean energy sources can be influenced by \nthe ownership structure of buildings. Multi-owner residential \nbuildings entail complex governance processes and rules \nregulating decision-making procedures. This could be a major \nbarrier to investment in clean energy sources. The higher \nthe share of publicly owned buildings in a city, the higher the \npotential for the installation of clean energy sources. Some \n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n88 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nforms of clean energy (e.g. wind, solar) require a lot of space if \nthey are to be able to make a substantial contribution to energy \nsupply. Cities will need to find the space (e.g. in peri-urban \nareas) required for clean energy infrastructure (Seetharaman \net al., 2019). A recent JRC study indicates that meeting the EU's \ntotal energy demand from clean energy sources would require \n18\u00a0%\tof\tall\tland\tin\tthe\tEU\t(EC,\t2019i),\talthough\tnew\tand\tmore\t\neffective technologies may reduce this figure.\n\nCities could take action to better coordinate energy policy, \nspatial planning and the construction of clean energy sources. \nIntegrating spatial and energy planning could help city \ngovernments to find solutions to developing decentralised \nclean energy (see Section 8.2.1). For example, it could ensure \nthat developments consider the orientation of and distances \nbetween buildings or the necessary width of streets (to avoid \nshadows) and alignments to optimise solar energy generation. \nThis could result in a trade-off between avoiding shading of \nbuildings to maximise clean energy production from solar PV \ninstallations and shading buildings as a measure to mitigate \nheat waves.\n\nGiven the interlinked nature of the energy transition challenges, \na set of coherent and coordinated actions at EU, national and \ncity levels are required. The clean energy transition is inherently \nlinked\tto\ta\trange\tof\tpolicy\tareas,\u00a0including:\n\n\u2022 climate change (e.g. 2030 climate and energy framework; \nequivalent national and local policies or strategies);\n\n\u2022 environmental protection (e.g. clean air for Europe; \nenvironmental, air quality, etc., strategies in cities);\n\n\u2022 circular economy (e.g. EU action plan for the \ncircular economy; local plans and initiatives for the \ncircular\u00a0economy);\n\n\u2022 digital transition (e.g. digital single market strategy);\n\n\u2022 economic development (e.g. EU sustainable development \npackage; Next Generation EU recovery package; local \neconomic development strategies and partnerships);\n\n\u2022 mobility (e.g. low-emission mobility strategy; local \ntransport\u00a0plans);\n\n\u2022 land\tuse\tplanning\t(e.g.\tlocal\tand\tregional\tland\tuse\u00a0policies).\n\nEnsuring positive synergies between energy policy measures \nand each of these policy domains will be required to bring \nabout the structural changes needed for widespread clean \nenergy production. The interactions and need for coordination \nbetween these policy areas may be particularly evident in \nurban areas such as the conflicting and synergistic relationships \nbetween energy, land use planning, mobility, economic \ndevelopment and environmental protection.\n\n\u00a9\tZsuzsanna\tR\u00f3zsa,\tMy\tCity/EEA\n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n89Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nThe transition to clean and decentralised energy systems \nrequires considerable initial investment, in particular for \nthose cities with ageing energy infrastructures. Falling tax \nrevenues and austerity measures in many cities in Europe \nmay further delay the necessary investment. This may be \nfurther exacerbated by the economic recession following \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Other financial factors include lack \nof investors and continuing competition from subsidised \nfossil fuels (Seetharaman et al., 2019). Recently, the mayors \nof some of the world's largest cities (e.g. London, New York) \nurged their counterparts to divest their municipal assets from \nfossil fuels. Cities can also work with their local or regional \npension funds to divest their assets in this way and support \nsustainable investments in energy production (C40 Cities, \n2020b). Other important actions that cities can take include \nexploring private-public partnerships and providing guidance, \nrecommendations, financial backing, land and assets for \npotential clean energy micro-producers. Cities can also be \nengaged more actively by becoming partners in clean energy \nmicro-generation\tthrough\u00a0cooperatives.\n\nThe transition to entirely clean energy power generation is a \nlong-term process and requires major infrastructure changes. \nOften there is limited infrastructure (e.g. transmission lines) \nto connect clean energy plants to the main grid (Seetharaman \net\u00a0al.,\t2019).\tExtending\texisting\tenergy\tgrids\tis\trequired\tto\t\nensure the integration of emerging clean energy microproducers. To achieve this, suitable policies are needed to \nprovide a framework and incentives for investments. It is \nimportant for city authorities to plan and integrate clean \nenergy generation within new infrastructure developments, as \nretrofitting them later will generally be more costly. The energy \ninfrastructure investment decisions and choices of today will \nlock cities into a path for many years and in some cases several \ndecades (EEA, 2017c). In their recovery from the COVID-19 \npandemic, cities could take advantage of the available EU \nsupport mechanisms to lock themselves into a path to a clean \nenergy future.\n\nA lack of appropriate technologies might limit the capacity to \nharvest, store and transport clean energy (Power Technology, \n2018). For city authorities to connect existing energy distribution \nand transmission networks to large offshore wind farms, \nfor example, may require grid extension and grid capacity \nexpansion. To improve energy storage from renewables, city \nauthorities could also invest in the development of affordable \nbattery systems and storage technologies such as underground \nstorage for heat (Future Learn, 2018).\n\nThe transition from conventional to clean energy sources in \ncities may encounter public resistance and opposition. Loss of \n\nvisual amenity and noise pollution from wind turbines are the \nmain concerns for many communities (Schumacher et al., 2019; \nSeetharaman et al., 2019). To overcome this, city authorities \ncan provide information to households and businesses \n(e.g.\u00a0public\tawareness\tcampaigns)\ton\tthe\tsocial,\tecological\t\nand financial benefits arising from the clean energy \ntransition. In addition, early engagement with communities \nto understand their opinions, perceptions and fears about \nthe development of new clean energy infrastructure can help \nto increase support (Bloomberg CityLab, 2019).\n\nAlongside large clean energy schemes, communities can \nalso play a role in achieving more decentralised energy \nproduction, through the establishment of small-scale \ncommunity-owned generation installations (e.g. through \nenergy cooperatives) and investments by individual \nhouseholds (e.g. depending on local context, geothermal, \nwind, micro-hydro or solar generation). Although energy \ncooperatives account for only a small share of the EU's \nrenewable energy capacity, they are widely considered \nimportant stakeholders in the clean energy transition \n(Wierling et al., 2018). This is due to the strong participation \nof local stakeholders and citizens, their considerable codetermination rights and their frequently pioneering role \n(e.g. electrification of rural areas, fostering the transition to \nrenewable energies) (Meister et al., 2020).\n\nCommunity energy schemes can bring co-benefits such \nas lower energy costs, public acceptance and reduced fuel \npoverty. For community energy to play a role, cities and \nmunicipal authorities would need to support communities \nand individuals (e.g. owners, tenants) of all income levels in \ntheir efforts to make the transition to clean energy production. \nFor many urban communities, the initial investment cost \nof these technologies is still considered too high. If clean \nenergy production remains feasible for only a few prosperous \ncommunities and/or individuals, the role that communities can \nplay in the clean energy transition is likely to be limited.\n\nThe knowledge and technical skills to engage with clean energy \ntechnologies may also vary within the community and among \nindividuals. For some, this could act a barrier for adopting these \ntechnologies (Vezzoli et al., 2018). If community energy is to be a \npart of the transition to clean energy, city authorities will need to \nengage with micro-producers (e.g. communities, households) to \nprovide, for example, information, best practice guides, training \nand support in terms of technical, financial, legal, regulatory and \nlong-term management solutions. As has been shown by the \npandemic, digital tools (e.g. Zoom, Microsoft Teams) are useful \nfor educating homeowners on renewable energy production \nand its benefits.\n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n90 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nTable 8.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving the clean energy transition in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 The considerable initial investment needed \nin clean and decentralised energy systems, \nin particular for those cities with ageing \nenergy infrastructures.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient infrastructure to connect clean \nenergy plants to the main grid.\n\n\u2022 Lack of appropriate technologies limiting \nthe capacity to harvest, store and transport \nclean energy.\n\n\u2022 Divesting energy generation from fossil fuels in favour of clean \nenergy\u00a0producers.\n\n\u2022 Providing guidance and recommendations for potential clean energy \nmicro-producers (e.g. communities, households).\n\n\u2022 Planning and integrating clean energy generation within new \ninfrastructure developments to ensure that the orientation and spacing \nof new buildings allows for solar PV installations on roofs and walls.\n\n\u2022 Investing in grid extension and capacity expansion to harvest and \ntransport energy from remote locations to cities. Also investing in the \ndevelopment of affordable battery systems and storage technologies. \n\n\u2022 Bureaucracy and regulatory challenges, \nincluding complex regulations; lack of \ncoordination between different authorities; \nplanning delays and long lead times in \nobtaining authorisation; and planning \nrestrictions on installing clean energy \ninfrastructure.\n\n\u2022 The space required for some forms of \nclean energy infrastructure (e.g. wind, solar \nPV installations) to make a substantial \ncontribution to the growing energy demand. \n\n\u2022 Implementing a set of coherent and coordinated cross-sector actions at \nEU, national and city levels, given the interlinked nature of the energy \ntransition challenges.\n\n\u2022 Reducing administrative hurdles and incentivising market entry for new \nclean energy producers.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring coordination and positive synergies between energy policy \nmeasures and a range of other policy areas, including climate change, \nenvironmental protection, circular economy, digital transition, economic \ndevelopment, mobility and land use planning.\n\n\u2022 Integrating spatial and energy planning to find solutions for \ndecentralised clean energy development (see Section 8.2.1).\n\n\u2022 Public concerns about and resistance to the \ntransition from conventional to clean energy \nsources in cities, in particular due to loss \nof visual amenity and noise pollution from \nwind turbines.\n\n\u2022 Lack of affordability of clean energy \ntransition for communities of all \nincome\u00a0llevels.\n\n\u2022 Providing information (e.g. public awareness campaigns) of the social, \necological and financial benefits of the clean energy transition.\n\n\u2022 Engaging with communities to understand their sentiments, \nopinions, perceptions and fears about developing new clean \nenergy\u00a0infrastructures.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring that energy transition measures (e.g. incentive mechanisms, \ntax exemptions) are affordable for communities of all income levels.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate knowledge and skills within the \ncommunity or among individuals to interact \nwith clean energy technologies.\n\n\u2022 Engaging with communities/individuals to provide the knowledge and \ntraining required.\n\n\u2022 Sharing of best practice in terms of technical, financial, legal, regulatory \nand management solutions.\n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n91Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n8.2.1 Example assessment of interlinked actions: \ndecentralised energy production by clean energy \nsources\n\nHow does decentralised energy production from \nclean energy sources fit within the clean energy \nnexus?\n\nMoving to clean energy through an increase in \ndecentralised generation:\n\n\u2022 requires long-term structural change in the \nenergy system, including the investment in \nand construction of smart and clean energy \ninfrastructure \u2014 related to the coordination of \nenergy and built environment policy areas;\n\n\u2022 requires integrated urban planning and alleviating \nissues over land use, noise and visual pollution \n\u2014 related to all three nexus policy areas: spatial \nplanning, built environment and energy;\n\n\u2022 relies on energy policies that reduce administrative \nhurdles and incentivise new clean energy producers \nto enter the market \u2014 related to rethinking energy \npolicy in a city context.\n\nThe transition to a decentralised clean energy system \nrequires long-term structural changes. The production \nof clean energy in a city will depend on geography and \nclimate but is likely to rely on wind power, solar PV rooftop \ninstallations and hydropower (EEA, 2015a; World Economic \nForum, 2018). A decentralised system can be more flexible \nand demand led. It can also represent a move away from the \nhistorical generation-led approach. Ultimately this calls for \nthe creation of a decentralised and circular energy system \nthat reduces energy use, reuses available waste energy \nsources, and generates clean energy at a small scale to \nmeet the remaining local energy demand (Energy Transition \nPartnership, 2019).\n\nRapid technological progress (e.g. improved energy \nstorage), cost reductions and the shift to electric mobility \nare key drivers of the growth in decentralised clean \nenergy production in the last decade (Ecofys, 2014; Power \nTechnology, 2018). However, the current energy market is \nconsidered unprepared for a more widespread decentralised \nclean energy model. Continued fossil fuel subsidies and \nincreased taxes on self-consumption of energy disrupt local \nclean energy producers. Other issues preventing local clean \nenergy uptake include changes in financial support, spatial \nplanning barriers and long lead times for administrative and \ngrid access procedures (IEA, 2017; EEA, 2018e).\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nMoving towards a decentralised clean energy system \nrequires a range of interventions and measures. These \ninclude establishing coherent overall policy goals, developing \ninstitutional capacity, encouraging stakeholder buy-in and \nfinancial support.\n\nA growing number of cities have already set targets to increase \nthe share of clean energy in their energy mix. The effectiveness \nof these targets depends on political commitment and public or \nprivate support.\n\nSupporting the dissemination of information among \nhouseholds and businesses and removing any legal barriers can \nincentivise investment in decentralised clean energy systems. \nTo achieve ambitious clean energy targets, cities may need to \nexplore opportunities in surrounding rural areas, which may be \nmore suitable (e.g. because they have more land available for \nsolar and wind power installations) (IRENA, 2016).\n\nIntegrated urban planning and design can help address issues \nrelated to land use and concerns about noise and visual \namenity. Visual amenity could be addressed by, for example, \nintegrating solar panels in rooftop materials. Energy policy \nmeasures could also ensure that clean energy infrastructure is \ndesigned in accordance with circular economy principles. This \nwould enable the reuse and recycling of various components at \ntheir end of use (EEA, 2017c).\n\nA transition to decentralised clean energy systems made up of \nsmall, localised grids can have a range of co-benefits, including \n(EEA, 2015a; IRENA, 2016; Lloyd, 2018; Power Technology, 2018; \nVezzoli et al., 2018):\n\n\u2022 climate mitigation by lowering carbon emissions;\n\n\u2022 for the environment, by reducing emissions of harmful \npollutants and improving air quality;\n\n\u2022 enhancing resilience through a more secure energy supply \nand improved ability to respond to immediate needs;\n\n\u2022 for the economy, by reducing transmission losses, offering \nmore competitive prices in the long term and resulting in \nmore stable costs; \n\n\u2022 for local communities, by, for example, creating jobs in \nbuilding and managing new energy infrastructure, as well \nas increasing their engagement in clean energy production \nand increasing their climate awareness.\n\nHowever, this transition will inevitably bring some trade-offs, \nfor example between the increase in decentralised clean \nenergy systems and the availability of rare materials and land \nfor development (EEA, 2017c; Giurco et al., 2019; Seetharaman \net al., 2019). Another important trade-off is between clean \n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n92 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nenergy production and unemployment in the conventional \nenergy sector (Rivers, 2013). One of the goals of the EU Just \nTransition mechanism is to provide reskilling opportunities \nfor those workers from carbon-intensive industries and to \nfacilitate employment opportunities in new sectors and those \nin\u00a0transition.\n\nBox 8.1  Solar Thermal Ordinance in \nBarcelona,\u00a0Spain\n\nSince 2000 (upgraded in 2006), a Solar Thermal \nOrdinance (STO) has been in place in Barcelona, making \nit compulsory to use solar energy to supply 60\u00a0%\tof \nhot running water in all private and public buildings, \nincluding new and renovated buildings and regardless \nof their size or intended use. The Barcelona Energy \nAgency (BEA) was established to evaluate the planned \ninstallations provided when a building developer seeks \napproval for both the building design and construction \npermit. Building inspectors are then responsible for \nensuring that construction meets the specified criteria.\n\nThe Barcelona STO is an example of the early adoption \nof such practices and is considered a success because it \nhas achieved significant energy savings and reductions \nin carbon dioxide emissions since it took effect. By end \nof 2010, 87\u00a0600\u00a0m2 of solar thermal panels had been \ninstalled. This initiative had also successfully popularised \nthe use of solar thermal energy, both within the city of \nBarcelona and beyond its borders.\n\nStakeholder engagement and education on the use \nand maintenance of their solar panels were identified \nas the main factors in the success of this project. The \nBEA worked with the neighbourhood association and \nthe body corporates of buildings to enable tenants and \nthe public to measure their energy savings and check to \nensure that the solar installations are working. In 2006 \nthe principles of this STO were adopted in legislation at \nthe national level and have since been followed by many \nmunicipalities in Spain.\n\nSource: Center for Clean Air Policy (undated).\n\n\u00a9 Bill Mead on Unsplash\n\f\nClean energy nexus \n\n93Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 8.2  Sustainable urban district of Vauban in \nFreiburg, Germany\n\nIn the late 1990s a mixed-use district of some 5\u00a0100 \nresidents was built in Freiburg on the site of a former \nFrench military base. The energy and heat are generated \nby large number of solar collectors and photovoltaic \nmodules and a highly efficient woodchip-powered \ncombined heat and power (CHP) generator connected \nto a district heating grid. Many houses in the district are \nproducing more energy than they use, and the surpluses \nare sold back to the city grid and the profits split \nbetween households.\n\nThe installation of photovoltaic panels and solar energy \nis encouraged through tax credits from the federal \ngovernment and subsidies from the regional utility. \nAs a result most of the electricity needed in Vauban \nis produced on site through CHP and photovoltaic \ninstallations.\n\nSource: Thorpe (2019). \n\nBox 8.3  Crowd investing in solar energy in \nKri\u017eevci, Croatia\n\nThe Green Energy Cooperative launched an initiative \nto\tinstall\ta\tsolar\tpower\tplant\ton\tthe\troof\tof\tKri\u017eevci\t\nBusiness Centre's administrative building.

However, there are also trade-offs, for example \nbetween decentralised clean energy systems the and availability \nof rare materials and land for development.\n\nThe clean energy transition will require stakeholder \ncooperation across different sectors and spatial scales (EU, \ninterregional, national and local/city). This should cover \nstakeholders across the end use (buildings, industry, and \ntransport) and transformation (power and district heat) \nsectors. Stakeholders beyond the energy sector should \nalso be engaged, including those from the urban planning, \nbuilding design and construction domains (IRENA, 2016). Such \nintegrated decision-making requires a deep understanding \nof planning processes across sectors and may include \nlocation-specific\u00a0actions.\n\nIt is important that energy policy reforms recognise the critical \ninterrelationships between the planning, built environment \nand energy sectors, bringing stakeholders together to explore \noptimal solutions for clean energy production. These reforms \nneed to be adapted to local conditions and provide the \nnecessary policy tools (e.g. green building codes, certification \nprogrammes and education campaigns). These reforms will also \nrequire effective policy and regulatory conditions to encourage \nprivate sector involvement. Cities are well placed to enable \nthese conditions and lead the implementation of such reforms \nand thus be leaders in the transition to clean energy.\n\nThe clean energy transition could be further stimulated by \nreducing or removing subsidies in the conventional energy \nmarket. Although it is likely to be beyond the scope of \ncities to influence this, it would increase competition and \ndrive innovation and price control, benefiting clean energy \nmicro-producers (e.g. homeowners, industries, energy \ncooperatives) in cities (Energy Transition Partnership, 2019).\n\nThe EU supports cities in their transition to clean energy \nthrough various tools and policies.

This \npolitical commitment is supported by EU funds (e.g. European \nFund for Strategic Investment, European Regional Development \nFund, Cohesion Fund) (EEA, 2017c). The Partnership on Energy \nTransition\u00a0(85) has prepared an action plan that reflects the \nneed for 'a more integrated, smarter, and more decentralised \nenergy system' (Energy Transition Partnership, 2019). There are \nalso several EU platforms and initiatives that provide advisory \nand financial support to local authorities (e.g. URBIS\u00a0(86), \nEuropean Fund for Strategic Investments\u00a0(87)). These can help \nto unlock, facilitate and accelerate investment in projects and \nprogrammes in urban areas, including clean energy schemes.\n\nWhile many policies are still enacted at the national or regional \nlevel, cities are increasingly taking control of their own (clean) \nenergy futures. Some EU cities have or are planning to bring \nmunicipal energy utilities back into local public and collective \nownership, referred to as 'remunicipalisation' (Worldwatch \nInstitute, 2016). This can empower cities to unlock the clean \nenergy transition through a range of actions. These include \ntarget setting; use of local regulations; operation of municipal \nutilities (including energy utilities); clean energy consumption \nin public buildings, street lighting, etc.; financing; and advocacy \nwork (IRENA, 2016). Coordinating these actions could help to \n'lock in' a city's long-term energy production into a clean, smart \nenergy system with greater levels of decentralisation.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on urban \neconomies across Europe. Cities have acknowledged the need \nfor investment in clean energy to reinvigorate local economies. \nIt is important that national governments and multilateral \nagencies support cities' efforts towards the clean energy \ntransition as part of their green recovery (C40 Cities, 2020a).\n\n(85) Urban agenda for the EU (agreed in 2016 through the Pact of Amsterdam).\n(86) https://eiah.eib.org/about/initiative-urbis.htm\n(87) https://www.eib.org/en/efsi\n(88) https://www.c40.org\n(89) http://www.climatealliance.org/about-us.html\n(90) https://www.covenantofmayors.eu/en\n(91) https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects\n(92) https://energy-cities.eu\n\nhttps://greensurge.eu/about \f\nClean energy nexus \n\n95Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n\u2022 European Energy Network (EnR)\u00a0(93).

Recognising this, the Europe 2020 strategy \nstresses the need to improve resource efficiency in the building \nsector (EC, 2010). This is also reflected in the EU action plan for \nthe circular economy (EC, 2015b). Under the European Green \nDeal, the European Commission has introduced a Renovation \nWave initiative to encourage faster and deeper renovation \n(EC, 2020e). In partnership with industry, the Commission has \nalso developed Level(s)\u00a0(102): a voluntary reporting initiative \nfor environmental performance in the built environment (EC, \n2019j). The European environment \u2014\u00a0state and outlook 2020 \n(SOER 2020) estimates that more than EUR\u00a01 trillion will need to \nbe invested in transport and buildings to achieve the EU's 2030 \nclimate and energy targets (EEA, 2019a).\n\nSustainable buildings have high levels of energy and resource \nefficiency and reduce environmental impacts across their \nlife cycles. Their users enjoy better health, well-being and \nproductivity. In turn this translates into cost savings (EC, 2016c). \nThe European Commission states that carbon emissions from \nthe\tbuildings\tsector\tcould\tbe\treduced\tby\taround\t90\u00a0%\tby\t2050.\n\nIt\tis\testimated\tthat\t80\u00a0%\tof\tEuropeans\twill\tlive\tin\tcities\tby\t2050,\t\ncompared\twith\t74\u00a0%\ttoday\t(EEA,\t2019a).\tAccommodating\t\nmore people in cities is likely to require more buildings and \nretrofitting of existing buildings (e.g. homes, schools). This in \nturn may increase resource and energy demand throughout the \nlife cycles of buildings (EC, 2019h). Construction and demolition \nwaste accounts for over a third (36\u00a0%)\tof\tall\twaste\tgenerated\t\nin the EU. At the same time, households as a sector account \nfor\t12\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\tannual\twater\tuse\tand\t27\u00a0%\tof\tfinal\tenergy\t\nconsumption in the EU (EEA, 2019a; Eurostat, 2019).\n\nThe potential for energy and resource savings through \nsustainable buildings is clear, and this nexus explores the \nrole that cities may have in realising this potential. This is a \nkey priority given the need not only to ensure that buildings \n\nuse more sustainable heating and cooling sources to reduce \ntheir associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but also to \nensure that they are designed to make them resilient to future \nclimatic\u00a0changes.\n\nIf more sustainable buildings are present in cities, this would \nsupport progress in other nexuses, in particular:\n\n\u2022 Climate resilience \u2014 through using sustainable heating \nand cooling sources to help buildings adapt to a warmer \nclimate and by reducing associated GHG emissions.\n\n\u2022 Closing the loop \u2014 through improving the management \nof construction waste and resource and material use \nin\u00a0construction.\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through well-insulated \nhousing that has better indoor air quality and reduced \nexposure to outdoor noise and that protects against heat \nand cold.\n\nSustainable buildings can also contribute to other nexus \noutcomes, including 'clean energy', through using rooftops for \nclean energy production; and 'quality of life', through designing \nhousing in which residents feel comfortable and safe and by \nreducing energy poverty in low-income families.\n\n9.1.1 The sustainable buildings nexus and the \nCOVID\u201119 pandemic\n\nImmediate COVID\u201119 pandemic response\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has left office and commercial buildings \nin urban centres dormant for a period of weeks or even months \nas businesses closed and/or homeworking became the norm. \nAn increase in homeworking has increased pressure to ensure \nthat building standards provide enough suitable living and \nworking space in residential buildings. Homeworking is also \nincreasing pressure in terms of energy consumption.

Energy use is also likely to increase, as many \ndomestic properties are likely to have less efficient heating \nsystems and poorer insulation than commercial buildings. \nSome national governments (e.g. Spain) have agreed with \nbusiness leaders that employers must cover their employees' \nhomeworking expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic has had a disproportionally negative impact \non socially and economically disadvantaged groups in cities. \nHousing is an important social determinant of health, with \nthose using sustainable buildings enjoying better health, \nwell-being and productivity. For those in poor-quality housing, \nlockdown means more time exposed to cold, damp and other \nhazardous conditions, which has consequences for both \nphysical and mental health.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption in \nconstruction supply chains. This has led to increasing interest \nin developing more sustainable and resilient supply chains by \nusing locally sourced or recycled material and ensuring more \nefficient use of scarce resources.\n\nLonger\u2011term implications as cities draw up and \nimplement COVID\u201119 recovery plans\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant changes \nin land use planning and building design and construction \nin future, including design for energy-efficient and healthy \nbuildings. Such changes could include minimalist building \ndesign; flexible entrance areas and more balconies; views \nof local landscapes from windows and access to sunlight \nprioritised in planning; and more natural ventilation (including \nlinear flow extraction, increased humidity control, heat and \nmoisture recovery) (Pinheiro and Luis, 2020). Through land \n\nuse planning, such changes could affect the green areas \nsurrounding buildings; the size of homes; and the existing \ninfrastructure (e.g. office buildings, transport networks) as a \nresult of increased homeworking.\n\nAs part of their green recovery plans cities could take advantage \nof the Next Generation EU recovery package to invest in their \nageing housing stock. Once it is available cities could use the \nfunds to retrofit/renovate public buildings, to improve energy \nefficiency, reduce GHG emissions and to create green jobs that \nwill kickstart the economy. Energy efficiency retrofits could \nprovide another important opportunity for a green recovery \nby creating jobs. For the users of the buildings, this would also \nreduce energy costs and ensure healthier buildings as a result \nof improved indoor quality. In the longer term the pandemic is \nproviding cities with an opportunity to establish and implement \ntheir own sustainability standards for their building stocks.\n\n9.2 Interlinked policy areas contributing to \nsustainable buildings in cities\n\nThis nexus focuses on areas of policy and action through which \ncities can improve the sustainability of their building stock. This \nnexus looks in particular at policy and action related to resource \nand material use, the built environment and urban design  \n(see Figure 9.1).\n\nMany challenges in achieving sustainable buildings result from a \nlack of coordination between the three policy areas included in \nthis nexus, for example, coordinating integrating sustainability \nprinciples in building design while ensuring that these principles \nare supported by policy relating to the use of resources and \nmaterials in a city. Integrating these policy areas could also have \nco-benefits, such as reducing building lifecycle costs (e.g. energy \nefficiency or material reuse) and creating healthier buildings.\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve sustainable buildings\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nResource \nefficiency\n\nBuilt \nenvironment \n\nquality\n\nHousing \nquality\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nLow energy\nconsumption\n\nEfficient \nmaterial use \n\nand zero waste\n\nEnergy\nefficiency\n\nExample challenge and action: \nReduce resource consumption in \n\nbuilding construction and \nuse by innovative design, \n\nmaterials and systems\n\nResources and \nmaterials\n\nBuilt environmentUrban design\n\nKey building blocks \nsupporting sustainable buildings\n\nIntegrated \nplanning\n\n \n\nFigure 9.1 The sustainable buildings nexus: key policy areas and building block\n\f\nSustainable buildings nexus \n\n99Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nThe sustainable buildings nexus focuses on the design, \nconstruction and use phases in the life cycles of residential, \npublic and commercial (e.g. retail, office) buildings. Taken \ntogether\tthese\trepresent\tapproximately\t99\u00a0%\tof\ttotal\tbuilding\t\nstock in the EU (Ecorys, 2014).\n\nThrough improved coordination of policy and action, resource \nand energy performance can be improved throughout \nbuildings' life cycles. Examples include:\n\n\u2022 improving housing quality and enabling energy efficiency, \nreduced material use, modularity and recycling in the \ndesign phase;\n\n\u2022 reducing material and energy intensity in the extraction and \ntransport phases;\n\n\u2022 increasing energy efficiency and modularity in the \nconstruction phase;\n\n\u2022 reducing energy and water consumption in the use phase; \n\n\u2022 enabling recycling and material recovery in the \ndemolition\u00a0phase.\n\nThe following sections explore some of the key challenges \nthat cities may face in seeking more sustainable buildings \nand the associated policy and practical actions. Table 9.1 \nthen provides an overview of the challenges and actions to \naddress them. The assessment also discusses in more detail an \nexample illustrating how coordinated action can improve the \nsustainability of buildings: reducing resource consumption in \nbuilding and construction through innovative design, materials \nand systems (Section 9.2.1).\n\nThis assessment example was selected by viewing the nexus \nthrough the circular city lens. The nexus could be viewed from \nother perspectives, which would help to identify other potential \nareas of action. For example, viewing the sustainable buildings \nnexus from the perspective of the low-carbon city might identify \naction related to reducing energy consumption throughout the \nlife cycles of buildings.\n\nChallenges of and actions for achieving sustainable \nbuildings in cities\n\nThe main challenges for achieving sustainable buildings are \nassociated with how, in practice, to reduce resource and energy \nuse throughout their life cycles. For example, how do we ensure \nefficient material (e.g. metals, minerals, concrete and timber) \nand water use, minimise waste and maximise recycling in the \n\nconstruction, retrofitting and use of buildings? To overcome this \nchallenge city authorities can work with building owners and \nbuilding\tdesign\tand\tconstruction\tbusinesses\t(e.g.\u00a0architects,\t\ncontractors) to promote innovative building design and \nimprove the management of construction materials (see \nexample assessment of interlinked actions in Section 9.2.1). \nAs part of the green recovery cities could take advantage of \navailable funds and work with building owners on these issues \nto kickstart the economy. Collaborative working between all \nstakeholders (e.g. building owners, design teams, contractors, \nmanufacturers, installers) can improve the coordination of \nbuilding design and construction and the associated resource \nmanagement. In turn, this can increase resource efficiency \nand help reduce buildings' lifecycle energy consumption and \nassociated GHG emissions.\n\nA range of actions can help to reduce resource and energy \nuse throughout buildings' life cycles, including establishing \nlocal building codes and sustainable design and retrofitting \nstandards that ensure greater ambition (Brilhante and Skinner, \n2015; IEA, 2020d). Cities could implement these actions as part \nof their green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Cities can \nalso play a direct role in encouraging sustainable buildings: city \nauthorities will often manage a sizeable building stock and can \nalso lead by example in developing new buildings. Green public \nprocurement is one of the tools available to cities. Through \nprocurement, sustainability standards and criteria can be set \nfor the suppliers of materials and services (e.g. the design and \nconstruction sectors), including the need for coordinated action.\n\nThere are already examples of standards for assessing the \nenvironmental design and use of buildings, such as the \nBuilding Research Establishment Environmental Assessment \nMethod\u00a0(BREEAM)\tand\tLeadership\tin\tEnergy\tand\tEnvironmental\t\nDesign (LEED). Such codes and standards\u00a0(103) aim to ensure \nthat energy efficiency, material use, and water and waste \nmanagement are considered in the building design phase. This \nrequires the design of, for example, closed cycles of water, \nwaste and energy in buildings using easily applied solutions. \nFurthermore, ambitious design, construction and retrofitting \nstandards can help reduce energy consumption in the use \nphase through better heating, ventilation and air conditioning \nsystems and access of natural light and green infrastructure. \nMaking effective use of space in buildings is important to \nensure efficient use of resources, including building materials, \nenergy and land. The size and shape of a building's envelope \n(i.e. design and construction of the exterior) are key factors \nin achieving these objectives. The design of a sustainable \nbuilding in which compactness is a guiding principle can provide \nmaterial and energy savings, limit heat gains or losses and \nlimit sprawl (D'Amico and Pomponi, 2019). The requirement \n\n(103) BREEAM, for example, measures building sustainability against the following categories: energy; water; waste; materials; land use; pollution; \nhealth and well-being; transport; innovation; and management.\n\f\nSustainable buildings nexus \n\n100 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nto practise modular construction, sustainable sourcing of \nresources and the use of smart energy-saving technologies \ncould reduce energy use during construction. Water \nuse and efficiency can also be included in construction \nspecifications, including on-site water use. This may include \neliminating leaks and recovering grey water for reuse in \nconstruction (WBDG, 2018). Such water efficiency practices \nwill bring about cost-effective improvements in buildings' \nenvironmental performance (Clement et al., 2012).\n\nImproving energy efficiency is a key issue for achieving \nsustainable\tbuildings.\tApproximately\t75\u00a0%\tof\tthe\texisting\t\nbuilding stock in the EU is considered energy inefficient \n(BPIE, 2017). The urgency of this issue has also been \nhighlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate \nimpact on those in poor-quality housing. Users of such \nbuildings are exposed to conditions that have negative \nconsequences for their physical and mental health. As \nmore people work from home utility bills will increase, \nparticularly\tfor\tthose\tliving\tin\tpoor-quality\thousing\t(e.g.\u00a0with\t\npoor insulation). These buildings would benefit from \nretrofitting to incorporate energy-efficient technologies \nand approaches. Retrofitting may include thermal \ninsulation, energy-efficient use of natural lighting, central \nmechanical ventilation systems, and heat and moisture \nrecovery systems. The uptake of these measures can be \ninfluenced by the ownership structure of buildings. In a \nheterogeneous ownership model the installation of energy \nefficiency measures requires the consent of the large \nmajority of flat owners in the building. Rules across EU \nMember States may vary, as may differences in the rights \nand obligations of homeowners (Matschoss et al., 2013). \nThis can have implications for the ease of making decisions \nabout and financing retrofitting. To accelerate the uptake \nof retrofitting, cities could facilitate financing models that \nenable energy efficiency investments to be repaid over time \nusing energy cost savings (C40 Cities, 2019). Such retrofitting \ncould bring co-benefits, such as reducing energy costs and \ncreating healthier buildings for residents.\n\nThe focus in sustainable buildings is often on design, \nconstruction and retrofitting, while the use and end-of-life \nphases are overlooked (Clarke, 2013). Consumer awareness and \nbehaviours are also important for the overall performance of \nsustainable buildings. Various studies have shown considerable \ndiscrepancies between expected and realised energy efficiency \ngains because of users' behaviour, meaning that theoretical \npotential gains are not achieved (Seebauer, 2018). To help \nensure that energy efficiency gains are closer to what is actually \npossible, cities could seek to raise consumers' awareness of \nefficiency measures and of the benefits of these for households \n(e.g. reduced energy bills) to encourage behaviour change. This \ncould also be achieved by city authorities organising events \n(e.g. public dialogue, roadshows) to involve local residents in \ndiscussions about resource and energy efficiency in homes. \nEngagement with local residents could also enable authorities \nto learn about people's requirements and preferences \nregarding their living space. Having this information could \nhelp authorities to design (or set standards and codes for) \nbuildings to help them achieve their sustainability potential. City \nauthorities can also benefit from establishing policy platforms \nthat enable stakeholders to share their knowledge and best \npractices, comment on proposed building plans and raise \nquestions.\n\nContextual factors and conditions can have an impact on \nintegrated planning and action across the nexus policy \nareas. For example, design solutions for building systems \n(e.g.\u00a0heating,\tcooling,\tventilation)\tand\tmaterials\tmay\tbe\t\ninfluenced by existing planning policy and building regulations; \nthe needs and preferences of all stakeholders; the design and \nuse requirements of the client; and the wider context such \nas climate, location and future pandemics. Similar factors \nwill influence the effectiveness of retrofitting in improving \nbuildings' sustainability and resilience to future climatic \nconditions. Therefore, any planned interventions regarding a \nbuilding's design, construction or retrofitting must consider \nlocal conditions, as well as the future climate, if they are to be \neffective (Lewis et al., 2013; EEA, 2015a).\n\f\nSustainable buildings nexus \n\n101Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nTable 9.1 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving sustainable buildings in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Inefficient resource and energy use \nthroughout the building life cycle (including \nenergy consumption and efficiency, water \nand material use and waste management).\n\n\u2022 Promoting innovative building design to help ensure efficient material \nuse in construction, reduce ongoing running and maintenance costs and \nenable adaptive reuse of buildings over their life cycles.\n\n\u2022 Coordinating building design, construction and associated resource \nmanagement to ensure efficient use of resources and energy.

Increased demand for these \nresources in the construction and use of buildings can have \nnegative environmental and social impacts. These impacts are \nparticularly significant in mining regions and on production \nsites (e.g. cement and steel production). The circular city will \nneed to address these negative effects by managing resource \nconsumption throughout buildings' life cycles.\n\nPossible policy responses and interventions\n\nThe EU circular economy and climate policy instruments and \nthe Roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe (104) (105) encourage \nsustainability of buildings in the EU. Such high-level policy can \nsupport existing efforts within the building sector. This occurs \nthrough setting targets and providing tools to encourage \nsustainable building design and construction, for example the \ngoals set in the EU action plan for the circular economy.\n\nThere are various interventions aimed at reducing resource \nconsumption in building construction and use. Common \ninterventions include innovative design, improved management \nof natural resources and building materials, and resource \nmanagement systems in buildings (e.g. water, waste).\n\n(104) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/green-growth/toolsinstruments/index_en.htm\n\n(105) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/resource_efficiency/about/\nroadmap/index_en.htm\u00a9 Ryunosuke Kikuno on Unsplash\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/green-growth/tools-instruments/index_en.htm\f\nSustainable buildings nexus \n\n103Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nInnovative building design can ensure efficient material use in \nconstruction and reduce ongoing running and maintenance \ncosts by using resource-efficient features, materials and \nappliances. Well-designed houses can further reduce building \nmaterial consumption by incorporating approaches that enable \nadaptive reuse of a building over its life cycle (Mohamed and \nAlauddin, 2016).\n\nImproved management of construction materials can also help \nto reduce resource use, for example identifying and procuring \nlocally sourced and/or recycled materials to minimise the \nneed for imported materials (Pullen, 2012). Choosing durable \nand low-maintenance materials can minimise the need for \nmaintenance and renovation over a building's lifetime. Installing \nimproved resource management systems in buildings, such as \nreusing grey water and recycling household waste, can improve \nthe resource efficiency of the use phase of buildings  \n(Lopez, 2016).\n\nImproved waste management can have an important role \nby providing a source of construction materials. Using waste \nmaterials in construction can reduce environmental impacts \ncompared with using virgin materials.\n\nBox 9.1  Applying a cradle-to-cradle design \nphilosophy to reduce resource \nconsumption during the use phase of a \n'newly built' office park in Hoofddorp, the \nNetherlands\n\nBuilt as the first full-service cradle-to-cradle (C2C) \noptimised working environment, Park20|20 is an office \ndevelopment with fully closed cycles of water, waste \nand energy. All buildings are connected to a grey water \npurification system and a central heating and cold \nstorage installation specifically built for the office park. \nThe project provided end-of-use options for buildings \nright from the start. It also established 'resource \npassports' \u2014 an approach to tracking materials and \ntheir corresponding residual value throughout the life \ncycle of each building. For example, users can track \nthe value of LED light systems, solar panels and office \nequipment. To regain material value at a building's end \nof life the suppliers are urged to come up with easily \napplicable solutions.\n\nThe project managers also held a series of workshops \nfor the tenants and clients of all the office buildings \nlocated in the park. The aim was not only to get to know \nclients and their requirements but also for clients to \nbecome acquainted with C2C principles. This was an \nimportant step in establishing a common understanding \nbetween all stakeholders and, most importantly, \nensuring that users are aware of and, through their \nbehaviour, achieve the full sustainability potential of \nthese buildings.\n\nSource: Leising et al. (2018).\n\nReducing material and water consumption in the construction \nand use of buildings can also lead to environmental and social \nco-benefits. These may include (Dobson et al., 2013):\n\n\u2022 benefits for ecosystems from reduced pollution and \ndegradation of the natural environment (e.g. for habitats \nand species);\n\n\u2022 climate benefits from reduced energy use and \nGHG\u00a0emissions;\n\n\u2022 health benefits from improved air quality during \nconstruction and inside finished buildings;\n\n\u2022 longer-term economic benefits from increased returns \non\u00a0investment.\n\nThe following examples from two European cities highlight \ninterventions aiming to reduce resource consumption during \nbuilding construction and use. Both examples highlight the \nimportance of coordinating design, materials and systems \nto help reduce resource demand during the life cycles \nof\u00a0buildings.\n\nBox 9.2  Optimising material use in a reconversion \nproject in Loos-en-Gohelle, France\n\nThe building's owner in partnership with local small to \nmedium-sized enterprises reconverted a historic house \n(Rehafutur engineer's house) into office facilities.\n\nThe project prioritised the reuse of all types of \nmaterials, considering the building's significant \nheritage value. For example, marble fireplaces were \nmoved and reused as ornamental features in public \nrooms, spruce floorboards were relaid after installing \nhigh-performance floor insulation, and rubble was \nreused to level the parking spaces and access paths. A \nparticular focus of the project was the use of building \nmaterials from renewable sources (animal and vegetal) \nand from recycled material. The project used a range \nof bio-based and recycled materials to demonstrate \nthe effectiveness of renewable insulation materials. \nFor example, a regional material made out of old \nclothes (mainly cotton) called M\u00e9tisse was used for \nthe\u00a0insulation.\n\nThe building will be monitored to evaluate its \nthermal performance and comfort in winter and \nsummer and to measure the achievement of energy \nefficiency requirements, identifying areas for potential \nimprovement in future.\n\nSource: Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2016). \n\f\nSustainable buildings nexus \n\n104 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nAlthough national standards provide some guidance on \naddressing sustainability issues in buildings, cities can \nintroduce their own proactive measures. For example, cities \nare able to institute their own building and energy codes that \ncould establish sustainability standards for their building \nstocks (ClimateXChange, 2018). Active collaboration between \nthe operators throughout the whole value chain in the \nconstruction sector (e.g. contractors, installers, architects and \nsuppliers, as well as producers of material, equipment and \nenergy) could be required to ensure that these standards are \nmet.\n\nThe lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic meant \nthat many people stayed in their homes for long periods \nof time. This has forced city authorities to think about their \nbuilding stocks in new ways, as the pandemic has highlighted \ninequalities in housing quality and its repercussions for health \nand well-being. By recognising the urgency of improving their \nbuilding stocks, cities could take advantage of the jobs created \nby energy-efficient retrofits to contribute to a green recovery.\n\n9.4 Existing networks and sources \nof \u00a0information\n\nVarious networks of cities have been established to take \ncollective action to reduce energy and resource consumption \nin new and existing buildings. By engaging with member cities, \nthese networks seek to facilitate collaboration and knowledge \nsharing among stakeholders to effectively achieve sustainable \nbuildings. Examples of existing networks and information \nsources relevant to the sustainable buildings nexus include:\n\n\u2022 BPIE\u00a0(106).

The nexus identifies a range of benefits arising \nfrom considering the following factors in building design, \nconstruction and use: social (e.g. health), environmental \n(e.g.\u00a0ecosystem\thealth,\treduced\tpollution),\tclimate\tmitigation\t\n(e.g. reduced carbon emissions) and economic (e.g. increased \ninvestment returns).\n\nThe engagement of residents is key, as behaviours related \nto reducing energy and water consumption in the home are \nas important for achieving sustainable buildings as the use \nof resource-efficient technologies and design (Hayles, 2015). \nThis could involve raising awareness among residents of the \nbenefits of more energy- and water-efficient behaviours. More \ncollaborative working through dialogue between architects, \nbuilding contractors and potential residents can also help to \nrealise energy and resource efficiency gains.\n\nAlthough there is no legal framework on sustainable buildings \nin the EU, several EU policies seek to achieve improved energy \nefficiency and reduced resource use, including in buildings \n(e.g. Energy Efficiency Directive, national energy efficiency \naction plans, EU action plan for the circular economy, energy \nunion). The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is the \nmain legislative instrument related to energy use and efficiency \nin the building sector. The directive recognises the need for \ncoordinated action among all stakeholders.\n\nThe fragmentation of policies and complex legislative \nframeworks on energy performance, waste management \nand construction materials may lead to a lack of integration \nof sustainable building measures (e.g. materials passports, \nreversible building design protocols). In some cases this \nfragmentation can lead to contradiction (Debacker and \nManshoven, 2016). Therefore, having an integrated policy \napproach is essential to avoid unsustainable long-term \ninvestment in building development and retrofitting.\n\nCities can play a key role in encouraging sustainable buildings. \nCity authorities will often manage a sizeable building stock \nand can also lead by example in developing new buildings. \nGreen public procurement is one of the tools available to \ncities. Through procurement, sustainability standards and \ncriteria can be set for suppliers of materials and services \n(e.g.\u00a0design\tand\tthe\tconstruction\tsector),\tincluding\tthe\tneed\t\nfor\tcoordinated\t\u00a0action.\n\n(106) https://www.bpie.eu\n(107) https://buildingefficiencyaccelerator.org\n(108) https://eubac.org\n\nhttps://www.bpie.eu\f\nSustainable buildings nexus \n\n105Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n\u2022 European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and \nCommunities\u00a0(109).

These policy \nagendas were identified from the assessments of the eight \nselected nexuses. Each of these policy agendas is relevant to \nat least two nexuses and generally to three or more. Although \nnot intended to be comprehensive, these policy agendas are \nrepresentative of the specific nexus actions identified in the \nassessments. Examples of specific nexus actions are also listed \nagainst each policy agenda to illustrate the types and range of \nactions seen across the nexuses.\n\nThis shows that, although cities are complex systems \nin which there are myriad interactions between \ninterventions and sectors, in practice a relatively small \nnumber of policy agendas can be identified through \nwhich urban environmental sustainability can be \nachieved. The example nexus analyses have shown that \nthe building blocks identified as part of developing the \nconceptual framework are a useful way of categorising \npolicy agendas that contribute to urban environmental \nsustainability.\n\n10.2 COVID-19 pandemic and urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had many wide-ranging impacts \nin cities. It is likely to remain intertwined with policymaking \nand actions across sectors and affect the transition towards \nurban environmental sustainability in the immediate and \nlonger terms.\n\nAs the pandemic is ongoing and its duration is uncertain, its \noverall implications for the nexus policy areas and progress \ntowards the nexus objectives is unclear. However, many of \nthe challenges and actions identified in the nexus analysis \nwill be influenced by the response to and need to recover \nfrom the pandemic. For example:\n\n\u2022 For spatial planning \u2014 implications for land use \nbecause of the additional demand for accessible public \nspaces, the potential decline in daily commuting and the \npreference for suburban living.\n\n\u2022 For transport \u2014 infrastructure changes due to the \ndemand for improved accessibility and active transport \nand to the potential ongoing reduction in public \ntransport use because of fears over safety.\n\n\u2022 For the built environment \u2014 demand for better-quality \nhousing, as more people are spending more time at \nhome and because of changes in building functions, with \noffice buildings potentially being converted to alternative \nuses such as housing.\n\f\nPolicy and governance implications\n\n108 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n\u2022 For resources and materials \u2014 changes in urban and \nregional production and value chains as a result of a \npotential shift in emphasis to more resilient and local \nsupply\u00a0chains.\n\n\u2022 For energy \u2014 an anticipated economic recession is likely to \naffect the funds available for investment in clean energy, \nas with other investments, and disruptions to the supply \nchain are likely to delay installations.\n\nThe nexus analysis also suggest that cities may have an \nopportunity to take advantage of the moment to implement \npolicies and action that maximise co-benefits across sectors \nand support a green recovery.\n\n10.3 Maximising co-benefits and avoiding \ntrade-offs\n\nThe analysis of the eight nexuses highlights the relationships \nand interactions between them. Firstly, they have both \nthematic links (e.g. the suggested clusters of 'environment \nand society' nexuses and 'resources and energy' nexuses) \nand hierarchical links (e.g. higher-level nexuses such as \n'climate resilience' and 'closing the loop', and more specific \nnexuses such as 'food security' or 'clean energy'). Secondly, \nthe nexuses are interlinked by the specific actions and \ninterventions. As highlighted in Table 10.1, policy and \naction intended to help achieve one nexus objective can \nlead directly to and/or have co-benefits and trade-offs for \nachieving other nexus objectives.\n\nFor example, climate adaptation and mitigation measures \nare key to achieving the 'climate resilience' objective, but \nalso contribute to achieving the following objectives: 'quality \nof life' (e.g. through action to create or enhance green \nspaces); 'urban accessibility' (e.g. through action to create \nspace for cycling and walking); and improved 'environment \nand health' (e.g. where creating green space or encouraging \nactive travel leads to better air quality, reduced noise \npollution and improved management of the urban heat \nisland effect).\n\nThe nexus analysis also helps to illustrate that a lack of \ncoordinated and integrated policy and action can result \nin trade-offs. For example, in the case of the 'urban \naccessibility' nexus, if not carefully integrated with other \nmeasures to improve urban connectivity and sustainable \nmobility, actions such as those aiming to increase urban \ndensity could lead to trade-offs. These could include \nincreased traffic congestion and associated air pollution \nand noise; reduced availability of and access to urban green \nspaces; and accelerated gentrification and increases in \nhouse prices. Such outcomes could conflict with the 'quality \nof life, 'environment and health' and 'climate resilience' \nnexus objectives.\n\n10.4 Identifying cost-effective policy \nand\u00a0interventions\n\nAs noted above, the example nexus assessments \nshow that some actions provide opportunities to \ndeliver multiple benefits simultaneously across urban \nsustainability objectives. Maximising the benefits of \ncoordinated and integrated policy and action has the \npotential to achieve urban sustainability objectives in \na cost-effective way. Policy and action related to green \ninfrastructure (GI), promoting public and active transport \nmodes and sustainable buildings provide good examples, \nas illustrated in Box 10.1. Clearly, just generating multiple \nbenefits does not necessarily mean that the action has \nachieved the combined benefits in a cost-effective way. \nSuch an assumption needs to be compared with achieving \nthe same benefits in an unintegrated way. However, it is \nlikely that this approach will be cost-effective.\n\n10.5 The role of cities in delivering urban \nenvironmental sustainability: top down \nand bottom up\n\nThe analysis of the selected urban nexuses supports \nthe assertion that cities are well placed to be leaders \nin delivering the transition to a low-carbon sustainable \neconomy, through their ability to address many of the \nsystemic challenges that Europe faces. It should be \nnoted, however, that this is also partially a result of the \nnexuses being selected for their relevance to cities and \ncity governance. Nonetheless, for most of the policy \nareas across the nexuses, the role of cities is well defined \n(e.g. transport, housing, spatial planning). This enables \ncities to design, resource and implement sector-specific \npolicy and actions without necessarily requiring reform \nof the policymaking process at national and/or EU levels. \nFor example, cities are key actors in setting out and \nimplementing land use and spatial planning policies \nand standards within their geographical limits, and the \nsolutions required are often location specific.\n\nHowever, EU and national governments also have an \nimportant role in ensuring complementarity between \npolicies at different scales and helping cities to overcome \nthe challenges of achieving the nexus objectives: for \nexample, by setting high-level strategic targets and goals \n(e.g. related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions), \ndeveloping clear standards and guidelines, providing \nfinancial\tsupport\t(Urbact\u00a0III\t(2014-2020))\tand\tpromoting\t\nknowledge sharing (e.g. Urbact good practices database) and \npeer-to-peer\u00a0exchange.\n\nBy addressing the urban sustainability challenges, cities can \nalso play a pivotal role in achieving EU policy objectives, for \nexample:\n\f\nPolicy and governance implications\n\n109Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\nBox 10.1  Examples of co-benefits\n\nDeveloping and improving green infrastructure in cities can help to deliver multiple objectives including:\n\n\u2022 'Climate resilience' \u2014 reducing flood risk and urban overheating.\n\n\u2022 'Environment and health' \u2014 reducing air and noise pollution and encouraging active travel.\n\n\u2022 'Quality of life' \u2014 improving people's satisfaction with where they live.\n\nThe 'urban accessibility' nexus highlights that transit-oriented development and promoting active transport modes can help \nto achieve:\n\n\u2022 'Environment and health', 'quality of life' and 'climate resilience' objectives through, for example, improved air quality, \nincreased physical activity levels, improvements in the quality of urban places and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAction to achieve the 'sustainable buildings' objective can also support:\n\n\u2022 'Closing the loop' \u2014 improving the management of construction waste and the use of resources and materials in \nconstruction.\n\n\u2022 'Clean energy' \u2014 using rooftops to produce clean energy.\n\n\u2022 'Climate resilience' \u2014 using sustainable heating and cooling sources to adapt buildings to a warmer climate and reduce \nthe associated greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u2022 'Environment and health' \u2014 through well-insulated housing that has better indoor air quality and reduced exposure to \noutdoor noise and protects against heat and cold.\n\n\u2022 'Quality of life' \u2014 designing housing in which residents feel comfortable and safe.\n\n\u2022 Developing GI is a key step towards the success of the \nEuropean Commission's GI strategy and EU biodiversity \nstrategy to 2030.\n\n\u2022 Mainstreaming urban adaptation strategies (e.g. in land \nuse planning) can help to achieve the objectives of the EU \nadaptation strategy.\n\n\u2022 Encouraging active transport modes, public transport \nand car-sharing/-pooling schemes can ensure success in \nmeeting the EU Ambient Air Quality Directive targets and \ndelivering the low-emission mobility strategy.\n\n\u2022 Minimising waste generation and maintaining the use and \nvalue of products, materials, built assets and land can help \nto meet the objectives of the EU action plan for the circular \neconomy.\n\n\u2022 Transition to decentralised clean energy production in cities \ncould help meet the objectives of the EU 2030 climate and \nenergy framework.\n\nBy addressing challenges and progressing these policy \nobjectives, cities play a key role in delivering the urban agenda \nfor the EU.\n\f\nPolicy and governance implications\n\n110 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\n10.6 New governance approaches to \nachieving urban environmental \nsustainability\n\nAddressing the challenges of achieving urban sustainability \nwill potentially require changes to existing governance \napproaches, which are often short term, sectoral and \nsiloed. The assessments of the nexus examples highlight \nthe importance of systematic identification of conflicts and \nbarriers across policy sectors and the need for horizontal \nand vertical integration and coordination of measures.\n\nHorizontal integration of measures will require an \nunderstanding of processes and objectives across sectors \nthat might be resource intensive. To achieve vertical \nintegration of measures the importance of multi-level \ngovernance is evident in several nexuses. For example, some \npolicy areas (e.g. transport, built environment) relevant \nto achieving \u2018urban accessibility\u2019 and \u2018climate resilience\u2019 \nobjectives are potentially managed by different stakeholders \nat different spatial levels. Achieving coordination between \nthe key actors from different governance levels (e.g. EU, \nnational, city) will help move cities towards reaching their \nurban sustainability objectives.\n\nAchieving urban environmental sustainability will also \nrequire giving a greater say and more power to all residents, \nespecially to the socially and economically disadvantaged, \nin urban decision-making. Participatory governance is an \nexample in which citizens are involved in the planning and \ndesigning of strategies. As an approach to governance and \ndecision-making, this can facilitate\n\n10.7 Citizens and communities are at the \nheart of the transition\n\nMoving towards greater urban environmental sustainability \nrequires acknowledgement that people are a fundamental \npart of the various systems (food, energy, transport, etc.). \nTo change such systems means engaging with citizens in \ndesigning and implementing solutions and encouraging \nsustainable behaviours. For example, the 'closing the loop' \nnexus highlights the value of community-led initiatives such \nas repair-cafes, which enable citizens to drive sustainable \nchange\tin\ttheir\u00a0communities.\n\nAcross all nexuses, in order to be truly effective, equitable \naction and collaboration must be central to any policy \nresponses. Vulnerable groups are often the most affected \nby poor urban conditions (e.g. air quality, road traffic noise, \naccess to green space) and are also the least able to benefit \nfrom improvements, as they are often not part of the \ndecision-making process. Decision-makers in cities need \nto ensure that achieving urban sustainability objectives \ndoes not come at the expense of the most vulnerable \n\nurban residents and that their needs are central to urban \nenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0objectives.\n\n10.8 Indicators and data measuring progress \ntowards urban sustainability\n\nThere is a varying availability of data and information on \nurban sustainability from sources managed and/or owned \nby EU agencies including the EEA and EU institutions, \nincluding the Commission (Eurostat, Joint Research \nCentre and thematic directorates-general), to support \nnexus\u00a0assessments.\n\nIt is evident that there is an abundance of quantitative \ncontextual indicators focusing on a single topic \n(e.g.\u00a0environmental\tquality,\tland\tuse,\ttransport\tand\tenergy)\t\nin an urban context. In contrast, for some topics, such \nas urban agriculture and food systems, there are more \nlimited sources of data, indicators and examples. The nexus \napproach would also benefit from the use of more complex \ncomposite indicators to provide evidence on the challenges of \nurban sustainability. From the eight example nexuses there \nis a limited number of such indicators already available that \ncould support such assessment, but the process has started \nto identify indicators that it could potentially be a priority \nfor\u00a0development.\n\nSome urban sustainability objectives could make use of \nqualitative evidence as well as quantitative evidence. For \nexample, assessing the quality of life aspects in urban \nenvironments through quantitative indicators that look at \nthe physical environment will not provide a comprehensive \ncharacterisation of this issue. Infrequent updates and lack of \nstandardisation and comparability of cross-country data for \ncities are also issues that need to be addressed to support \nthe assessment of urban sustainability.\n\nThe nexuses used in this analysis are framed around an \nobjective (e.g. clean energy, accessibility) and selected \ninteracting policy areas. Measuring progress towards \nthese objectives could be achieved by either using existing \noverarching indicators or indices or creating new ones. The \nresults of an initial overview of potentially relevant indicators \nfor each nexus are presented in Annex 1.\n\n10.9 Using the nexus approach to improve \nurban policy integration\n\nIn applying the nexus approach in an urban context, \nthe assessment successfully identified opportunities for \nimproving policy coordination and integration to achieve \nselected urban sustainability objectives. This approach can be \nuseful for decision-makers, as it encourages communication \nand coordination to help realise co-benefits from policies \nand action across policy areas. It can also help to uncover \n\f\nPolicy and governance implications\n\n111Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Learning from nexus analysis\n\npotential blind spots in decision-making processes that lead to \nunintended consequences and undermine progress in other \npolicy areas or aggravate existing challenges for cities. This is \nachieved by highlighting potential trade-offs.\n\nAn important aspect of the nexus approach is to identify \nkey actions in the context of meeting the selected urban \nsustainability objectives (e.g. climate resilience, clean energy). \nHere the conceptual framework is particularly useful, as \nit proposes the application of lenses and building blocks. \nDepending on the perspective of the selected lens (e.g. \ncircular city, resilient city), this can help to identify the focus of \nanalysis and potential critical policy agendas. By categorising \nthe\tactions\tunder\tpolicy\tagendas\t(see\tTable\u00a010.1)\tthe\t\nbuildings blocks are shown to provide a useful and relatively \ncomprehensive set of relevant actions that contribute to urban \nenvironmental\tsustainability.\tAnnex\u00a01\tidentifies\tpotential\t\nindicators for monitoring outcomes related to each nexus. \nTo measure wider progress towards urban environmental \nsustainability, future work on indicators could usefully explore \nexisting indicators or develop new ones to measure progress

Centres (ETCs) as well as \nthe wider urban stakeholder group that contributed to the study design and scrutinised the research findings \nvia multiple in-person and virtual stakeholder meetings, and provided constructive feedback that supported the \ndevelopment of this final report. Some institutional stakeholders from the European Commission have supported \nthis project since its inception, including DG REGIO, DG CLIMA, DG ENV and the JRC. The EEA would also like \nto thank the cities that supported this work by participating in the survey on urban sustainability transitions: \nBarcelona, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Essen, Freiburg, Gabrovo, Ghent, Glasgow, Hamburg, Horst aan de Maas, Lahti, \nLeuven, Lisbon, Ludwigsburg, Malm\u00f6, Mechelen, Mikkeli, Nantes, Nijmegen, Oslo, Reykjav\u00edk, Stockholm, Tallinn, \nTorres Vedras, V\u00e4xj\u00f6, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Ume\u00e5. Special thanks go to the city officials from Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, \nGabrovo, Leuven, Lisbon, Mikkeli, Stockholm and Tallinn that took time out of their busy schedules to participate \nin the semi-structured interviews and thereby enabled a deeper understanding of the specific drivers and barriers \nthese cities are facing in their sustainability transition.\n\nThe EEA project manager was Ivone Pereira Martins.\n\f\n5\n\nCOVID-19 preamble \n\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nCOVID-19 preamble\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has had wide-ranging impacts \non cities and is likely to remain deeply intertwined with \nefforts to transition towards more environmentally \nsustainable urbanisation patterns for years to come. \nHowever, the research for this report, including the \nsurvey and interviews with city representatives, were \nfinalised just as the coronavirus emerged in Europe. \nAs such, the data do not capture how COVID-19 and its \naftermath may be affecting the profiled cities and their \nperspectives on the urban sustainability transition. \n\nWherever possible, this report reflects briefly on the \nways some of the observed drivers and barriers may be \nshaped by the coronavirus crisis. However, it should be \nnoted that this is purely speculative and is not based on \nempirical evidence from any of the participating cities. \nFollow-up research would be required to understand \nif and how their answers may have changed in light of \nthis new reality. \n\nThe present report is both a prototype and a \nbenchmark. What is presented here \u2014 with the \ninvolvement of a limited number of cities \u2014 serves to \ntest our methodology, before use with a larger number \nof participant cities. Meanwhile, given that it depicts \ncities' concerns and perspectives immediately before \nthe outbreak of the pandemic, this report is also a \nperfect benchmark to assess how the new reality has \nchanged key cities' views about what is driving their \nsustainability transformations.\n\nWe know that cities have been at the forefront of the \nhealth crisis from the very beginning, not only bearing \nthe worst impacts but also becoming essential actors \nin proactively and innovatively addressing the health \nemergency, as well as dealing with the wider social and \neconomic ramifications. It is clear that city, national and \nEU budgets will come under strain as a result of the \neconomic crisis, which may result in reduced budgets \nfor core environmental initiatives in the years ahead. \n\nAt the same time, many policies that have been \nimplemented primarily to deal with the health \nemergency will also have long-term environmental \n\nbenefits (e.g. improved active travel infrastructure) \nand there is a growing movement of cities in Europe \nactively committing to a green recovery from the crisis \n\u2014 supported by initiatives at the EU level, such as the \nEuropean Green Deal. \n\nAs regards cultural shifts, similar uncertainties exist. \nWhile people may be more attuned to the importance \nof clean air and high-quality green spaces, we are also \nseeing, for example, growth in single-use plastics, \nand a renewed preference for the use of private \ncars over public transport, which may have serious \nenvironmental consequences. \n\nWhat is clear is that for most Europeans, the pandemic \nhas caused abrupt changes in daily routines that will \nhave far-reaching consequences for cities. For many \nurban dwellers, working from home has become the \nnew normal, video conferences have replaced faceto-face meetings (and related business travel), online \nshopping is taking over from physical retail, and people \nare becoming better acquainted with their immediate \nneighbourhoods and local green spaces.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is clearly a challenge of \nunprecedented proportions, while also offering \na window of opportunity that may accelerate \nsustainability transformations in cities. From the \nperspective of both research and practice, it is clear \nthat there is a long agenda of issues that will have \nto be tackled in the months and years ahead. These \ninclude, for example: what a green recovery looks \nlike for different cities; the meaning of urbanity and \nthe appropriate mix of land uses; new requirements \nfor the design of the public realm and green spaces; \nopportunities and challenges presented by new \nmodes of transport; changes in urban functions \n(e.g. homes becoming the hub of day-to-day life \nand office buildings being converted to housing); \nthe impact on local business and service providers \n(e.g.\u00a0less\tinner-city\tfootfall);\tthe\trole\tof\ttechnology\t\nand digital futures; urban and regional production \nand value chains; and considerations of new forms of \nurban\u00a0decision-making.\t\n\f\nCOVID-19 preamble \n\n6 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nWhile current efforts are rightly focused on tackling \nthe immediate challenges posed by the pandemic, it \nis important to swiftly put in place recovery pathways \nthat align with wider sustainability objectives. The \nEU's ambition of climate neutrality by 2050 and \nits European Green Deal must stay on track, while \ncontinuing to recognise the profound societal changes \nwe\tare\u00a0undergoing.\t\n\nMoving forward, it will be ever more important to \nensure a fair transition for all while rebuilding our \n\neconomies sustainably. One important legacy of this \ncrisis is likely to be the realisation that behaviours, \ninstitutions and even infrastructure can be changed a \nlot faster than may have previously been assumed. We \nare not as 'locked-in' to certain ways of doing things as \nwe thought and, if needed, can radically transform how \nour cities operate and how we operate within them. \nThis has important implications for cities when it comes \nto the transformation of systems that will be required \nto tackle the climate and ecological crisis in the years \nto\u00a0come.\n\f\n7\n\nExecutive Summary \n\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nBackground and policy context\n\nThe EEA's European Environment \u2013 State and Outlook \n2020 Report (SOER 2020) emphasises that cities are key \ndrivers of change when it comes to wider sustainability \ntransitions across Europe. Cities are hubs of creativity, \ninnovation and learning and have the capacity to \neffect systemic changes across a range of critical \nenvironmental issues (EEA, 2019). Cities concentrate \npeople, jobs and economic activity, however, this also \nmeans that they are disproportionately impacted by \nsocial challenges such as segregation, poverty and \ninequality (EC, 2016). Vulnerabilities from climate \nchange and other environmental stresses will also be \nfelt most acutely in urban areas due to higher densities \nof people and infrastructure, and the dependence \nof cities on their hinterlands for food, water, energy \nand other resources (EEA, 2019). The EEA's in-depth \nanalysis of drivers of change of relevance for Europe's \nenvironment and sustainability (EEA, 2020) emphasised \nthat cities have a primary role in pushing forward \nsocietal change by harbouring the circulation of ideas \nand encouraging social and technological innovations, \nexperiments and changes in values, lifestyles and \napproaches to governance.\n\nCities are therefore both places where systemic \nchallenges must be met, and places of opportunity \nto address these challenges. Of course, cities differ \nenormously in the challenges they face and the tools \nthey have available to address these. Sharing concrete \nexamples of the many different expressions of urban \nsustainability can help to inspire cities, irrespective of \ntheir context, to recognise that there is a transition \npathway that is right for them.\n\nThis report provides some initial ideas about how \nprogress towards this goal can be accelerated by \nidentifying common factors that can either enable or \nhinder urban sustainability transitions. Understanding \nthe underlying factors that have allowed some \nEuropean cities to address complex environmental \nchallenges while simultaneously thriving economically \nand strengthening their social fabric has relevance \nfar beyond the case of individual cities. Across the \nEU, the important role of cities as champions for \n\nenvironmental sustainability is being recognised, \nand yet there is not enough information about what \nactually allows some cities to engage in transformative \nchange in this arena. Understanding the right enabling \nconditions and drivers of these changes is important, \nbut so too is a clearer sense of the barriers that \nmay be preventing some cities from reaching their \nsustainability potential or overcoming long-standing \neconomic, institutional and cultural challenges \nthat may be leading to sub-optimal environmental \noutcomes. This report also aims to provide important \nlessons about the way in which cities and national \ngovernments can foster more sustainable urban \ngrowth that protects environmental quality and \ncreates thriving, low-carbon and climate-resilient \ncommunities that promote economic vitality, health, \nwellbeing and social inclusion. This report is the \nfirst in a series of EEA outputs focusing on urban \nsustainability transitions.\n\nResearch approach\n\nDrawing on the expertise of a wide range of \nstakeholders, the EEA has developed an overarching \nconceptual framework for urban environmental \nsustainability to provide the basis for future \nassessments. The conceptual framework is based \non four main components: lenses; context; enabling \nfactors; and building blocks.\n\nThis report focuses on one initial dimension \u2014 an \nanalysis of drivers of and barriers to transitions \ntowards urban environmental sustainability \u2014 using \nthe context and enabling factors as entry points into \nthe discussion. \n\nThe research is based on a mixed-method approach \nthat combines a literature review, survey and \ninterviews with city authorities to provide a wellrounded picture of the different factors that are driving \nenvironmental sustainability in European cities. The \nsurvey was conducted with a selection of 'frontrunner' \ncities that have either won or been selected as finalists \nin the European Green Capital Awards (EGCA) or the \nEuropean Green Leaf Awards (EGLA). \n\f\nExecutive Summary \n\n8 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nThis is a relatively small-scale pilot study to test the \napproach and results should therefore not be seen \nas capturing the full spectrum of drivers and barriers \nexperienced by the case study cities, but as an entry \npoint to a wider conversation about the drivers of and \nbarriers to urban sustainability transitions.\n\nUrban environmental sustainability \ntransitions: drivers and barriers\n\nThis exploratory piece of work delivers important \nfindings in relation to the key drivers of and barriers to \nurban sustainability transitions. Looking across all of \nthe enabling factors identified in this research, certain \nfactors stand out. While some factors provided a level \nof consensus, there was also divergence in how cities \nassessed the importance of different factors. Factors \nthat were identified as extremely important to achieving \nsustainability transitions by some cities, were highlighted \nas barriers or seen as a less relevant by others, indicating \nthat there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach.\n\nBoth drivers and barriers were identified within seven \nkey areas: context; governance; knowledge; culture; \ntechnology, data and information; and finance. These \nare examined in detail within the report.\n\nKey lessons emerging from this research \n\nThere are a number of specific lessons that emerge \nfrom this research. These lessons may be helpful to \npolicy-makers but also other urban stakeholders, \nincluding local citizens, NGOs and the research \ncommunity to accelerate urban environmental \nsustainability transitions across European cities.\n\n\u2022 Cities are heterogeneous and transitions \npathways need to be tailored to local contexts, \nas drivers and barriers can differ greatly between \ncities. In order to achieve successful urban \nsustainability transitions across Europe, the \ndiverse needs and capacities of individual cities, \nas well as different policy and sectoral priorities, \nneed to be taken into account and supported by \nflexible EU, national and regional governance and \nlegislative\u00a0systems.\t\t\n\n\u2022 Some contextual factors are fixed and \nhard to change (e.g. climate, geographical \ncontext), but many are dynamic and evolving \n(e.g.\u00a0demographics,\tGDP,\tinfrastructure)\tand\t\ncan be influenced by agile policy-making and \ntargeted policy interventions. Understanding \nthe complex relationships between the existing \n\nurban context and cities' constantly evolving \nsustainability efforts can help them prioritise the \nmost appropriate environmental policies for their \nindividual\u00a0circumstances.\n\n\u2022 City governments' sustainability visions and \nstrategic plans are vital as foundations for \nfurther action. Coupled with clear and measurable \ntargets and committed leadership they can \nplay an important role in advancing ambitious \nenvironmental goals. Visions and plans should \ninclude clear development trajectories and need to \nbe aligned with wider programmes set at national \nand EU level. \n\n\u2022 EU laws and policy frameworks have a key \nrole to play in accelerating sustainability \nchanges in cities. Cities are strongly incentivised, \nsupported and even inspired by EU laws, standards, \nregulations and funding opportunities. The \nEuropean Green Deal, the Urban Agenda for the EU \nand various EU Directives (e.g. Water Framework \nDirective, Energy Efficiency Directive, Energy \nPerformance of Buildings Directive) all play a critical \nrole in shaping city action.\n\n\u2022 National and supranational governments can \nfacilitate, as well as inhibit, systemic change \ntowards urban sustainability transitions in cities. \nWhilst they are crucial in fostering knowledge \nexchange and supporting strong networks that \nenable peer-to-peer learning (e.g. European Green \nCapital Award, European Green Leaf Award), some \ncities highlighted that a lack of alignment between \nlocal, national and supranational priorities and \nobjectives can undermine progress. \n\n\u2022 Cities benefit from greater decision-making \npowers and fiscal autonomy, particularly when \nit comes to policy sectors that most acutely \ninfluence local sustainability outcomes. A lack of \nfiscal autonomy was repeatedly highlighted as a \nbarrier that constrains cities in accelerating their \nsustainability transitions, particularly when it comes \nto large-scale investments such as new transport \ninfrastructure.\n\n\u2022 City networks and focused partnerships can add \nvalue, for example through knowledge sharing and \ncreating spaces for cities to learn from each other's \nexperiences. The networks work best when they \nencourage collaboration rather than competition \nand when it is very clear what their value-added is for \nindividual member cities. Having a safe space to not \nonly share successes but also failures was highlighted \nas an important aspect of such networks. \n\f\nExecutive Summary \n\n9Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n\u2022 Local research and experimentation can \naccelerate innovation and is critical to identifying \nlocally appropriate solutions by using the city as a \ntestbed for new ideas. It also allows cities to think \nabout the different sustainability nexuses that they \nwant to address and to find solutions that can lead \nto co-benefits across different critical policy sectors.  \n\n\u2022 Involving various stakeholders and supporting \neffective public engagement in decision-making \nprocesses leads to better sustainability \noutcomes. A sense of ownership and shared \nresponsibility can help to create a common \nunderstanding of sustainability issues across \nvarious government sectors and levels, while also \nfostering buy-in from the private sector and the \ngeneral public, encouraging behavioural changes in \nsupport of the sustainability transition.\n\n\u2022 New technologies can play an important role \nbut need to be inclusive and fit for purpose. \nWhile new technologies are not a panacea for all \nenvironmental challenges, and care must be taken \nto account for possible unintended consequences \nor side-effects (e.g. social exclusion and inequality \nin access to goods and services), technological \ndevelopments play an important role in accelerating \nsustainability transitions. \n\n\u2022 Updated and accessible data and information \nis needed to monitor progress. This leads to \nbetter environmental management and makes \nit easier to demonstrate how a city is advancing \ntowards specific goals. Collaboration with national \nand EU statistics offices, along with EU directives \nand memberships of other EU networks, helps \ncities to identify areas where they may be lagging \nbehind and incentivises them to improve their data \nand information collection processes. Using new \ntechnologies to improve data collection and analysis \nis also essential. \n\n\u2022 Communicating information effectively and \ninnovatively is an important part of engaging \nthe public. Thinking in innovative ways about \nhow data and information can be presented \nto highlight challenges or new initiatives can \nensure that the public is clear about what the \ncity is aiming to achieve and how they can be \npart of the sustainability transition. Innovative \nways of communication include more qualitative \nstorytelling, having high-profile 'champions' to \npromote more sustainable behaviours, accessible \nand attractive methods of data visualisation \nand presentation, as well as better availability of \nopen\u00a0data.\n\n\u2022 Accessing EU, national and private funding plays \na critical role in supporting cities' sustainably \ntransitions. Governments can accelerate systemic \nchange by reorienting financial flows towards \nsustainable investments and by developing relevant \nknowledge systems and skills to support these. \nWhile wealthier cities usually have more control \nover their investments, for cities with less ownsource revenues, knowing how to access other \nsources of funding at EU and national level can be \nan important driver of progress.\n\n\u2022 Green procurement processes and sustainable \nconsumption are important drivers of change. \nGreen procurement practices provide an \nopportunity for cities to align public spending with \ncore environmental objectives, so these processes \nneed to be simplified and streamlined. Ensuring \nthat individuals use their purchasing power for good \ncan be a challenging area for cities to influence, \nbut more sustainable consumption patterns \nwithin wider society was seen as an important \ncomplement to local government efforts.\n\nFuture research opportunities\n\nThe findings and emerging lessons from this study \nprovide an entry point to a wider conversation \nabout the drivers of urban sustainability transitions. \nFurther research will be needed to develop a more \ndefinitive overview of the multitude of complex and \ninterrelated factors that shape sustainability outcomes \nin European cities. Looking ahead, there are a number \nof important areas of work that emerge from this initial \nanalysis,\u00a0including:\n\n\u2022 Expanding the survey to include more cities\n\n\u2022 Interviewing a wider range of cities or using \ninterviews as deep dives into specific topics\n\n\u2022 Linking the findings to major new EU policy \ninitiatives as well as the coronavirus pandemic\n\n\u2022 Exploring wider themes and subject areas that may \nbe driving the sustainability transition\n\f\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?10\n\nIntroduction\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Background \n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that the complex \nand interrelated challenges of climate change, \nenvironmental degradation and rising inequality will \nnot be solved without a fundamental transformation of \nour societies. Far-reaching changes are needed to our \ntechnologies and infrastructures, cultures and lifestyles, \nas well as adaptations to the corresponding governance \nand institutional frameworks. Around the world, these \nimportant system innovations are converging in cities. \n\nCities are places with an increased urgency for \nsustainability transitions. Many systemic environmental \nand social challenges are focused on cities and, in \nabsolute terms, they have disproportionately high \nenergy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions. At the same time, many of the most \nimportant innovations designed to counteract \nunsustainable behaviours and practices are originating \nin cities (GCEC, 2014). These include emerging social \ninnovations such as sharing and the circular economy, \nshifts towards sustainable mobility, 'prosumerism', \nslow-food movements and community-oriented \nways of living (EEA, 2020) as well as energy-efficient \nhousing, urban farming, and renewable decentralised \nenergy systems (Frantzeskaki et al., 2017). There is \nalso a wider trend related to the empowerment of \ncity governments, with city networks and associations \nplaying an increasingly important role in shaping global \nclimate and sustainability agreements (EEA, 2020). Such \nsystemic realignments can be referred to as urban \nsustainability transitions: fundamental and structural \nchanges in urban systems through which persistent \nenvironmental and societal challenges are addressed. \n\nResearch into sustainability transitions aims to \nunderstand the long-term, multidimensional and \nfundamental transformation processes through \nwhich established socio-technical systems may \nbegin to shift towards more sustainable modes of \nproduction and consumption. Understanding how such \ntransformations can be accelerated in cities will be vital \nto ensuring that we are able to adequately address the \nclimate and ecological emergency. Given the European \nEnvironment Agency's remit and interests, the focus of \nthis research is on urban environmental sustainability \n\ntransitions. Note that throughout the report, where \nthe term 'sustainability transitions' is used, the \nprincipal focus is on the environmental dimension of \nsustainability transitions within an urban context. This \nis not to say that environmental transitions do not also \nrely to a great extent on social, economic and political \ntransformations, but just that these will be framed in \nthe context of environmental sustainability. \n\nThe European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 \nreport (SOER 2020) shows that there is a rapidly closing \nwindow of opportunity for such transformational \nchange to take place, and that cities are a vital resource \nin this context. We have now entered a critical decade \nduring which we must intensify our efforts to enable \nand improve the quality of life for future generations \nby protecting the environment, biodiversity and \necosystems, lessening the impacts of climate change \nand radically reducing our consumption of natural \nresources. The good news is that we already have a lot \nof the knowledge, technologies and tools we need for \nsustainability transitions to take place \u2014 the question \nnow is how to accelerate and scale up this process \n(EEA,\u00a02019).\t\n\nUnderstanding the sustainability innovations that have \nallowed some European cities to address complex \nenvironmental challenges while simultaneously thriving \neconomically and strengthening their social fabric \nhas relevance far beyond the case of individual cities. \nAcross the EU, the important role of cities as champions \nfor environmental sustainability is being recognised. \nYet, there is insufficient information about what allows \nsome cities to engage in transformative change. \nUnderstanding the enabling conditions and drivers of \nthese changes is important. So, too, is a clearer sense \nof the barriers that may be preventing some cities from \nreaching their sustainability potential or overcoming \nlong-standing economic, institutional and cultural \nchallenges leading to suboptimal environmental \noutcomes and preventing more radical change from \ntaking place. \n\nIt should be noted that all cities that participated in \nthis research were either winners or finalists of two \nprestigious awards and, as such, can be seen in many \nways as leaders when it comes to urban sustainability. \n\f\nIntroduction\n\n11Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nThis might contribute to the overall positive view of the \nfactors influencing urban environmental transitions. \nIf cities that are less successful in making progress \ntowards sustainability had been included in this \nresearch, the factors tested may have seemed to be \nless supportive of urban environmental sustainability \ntransitions than implied in this study. Moreover, \nkey drivers and barriers identified might have been \ndifferent. Nevertheless, this does not make the \nresearch approach less applicable to any given city.\n\n1.1.1 The EEA's activities on urban sustainability\n\nThis report is the first in a series of EEA reports and \noutputs focusing on the topic of urban environmental \nsustainability transitions to be published in 2021 and \n2021 (see Figure 1.1). It explores some of the key \nfactors driving urban environmental sustainability \ntransitions in selected cities, with the hope that their \n\nexperiences can provide useful lessons. Alongside this \nreport, a briefing on COVID-19 and urban sustainability \nin Europe has been published to highlight some of \nthe impacts of the pandemic and features of a green \nrecovery if the Green Deal is to be successful in \nengaging cities. \n\nThe EEA will be publishing a report on Urban \nsustainability in Europe \u2013 Avenues for change (EEA, \nforthcoming). This will present the EEA's urban \nenvironmental sustainability conceptual framework \n(as presented in Figure 1.2) and an overview of \nthe analysis of some priority urban sustainability \nnexuses. These nexuses aim to help understand \naspects of complex urban systems and to better \nidentify coordinated polices and actions to support \nurban environmental sustainability. More details of \nthis analysis will be presented in a standalone Urban \nsustainability in Europe \u2013 Learning from nexus analysis \nreport (EEA, forthcoming).\n\nFigure 1.1  EEA reports and outputs focusing on the topic of urban environmental \nsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\nAssessment and reporting outputs\n\nMethod and context outputs\n\nTHE MAIN REPORT\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\nAvenues for change\n\nFlagship report on urban environmental\nsustainability setting out the EEA's conceptual\n\nframework and summary of analysis\nor urban nexuses and drivers\n\nThe Covid-19 briefing\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nOpportunities for challenging times\n\nAn initial overview of key impacts of \nthe pandemic on urban environmental \n\nsustainability, and lessons from how \ncities are responding\n\nThe methodology report\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nA stakeholder-led assessment process\n\nDescribes the stakholder-led process of \ndeveloping and applying the knowledge\n\nbase and conceptual framework for\nurban environmental sustainability\n\nThe glossary\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nGlossary of key terms and concepts\n\nA glossary of key terms and concepts\n used in the EEA's work on urban \n\nenvironmetal sustainability\n\nThe nexus assessments\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\n Learning from nexus analysis\n\nAn assessment of eight urban sustainability\nnexuses to explore the complexity\n\nof urban systems and highlight policy priorities\n\nThe drivers report\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\nWhat is driving cities\u2019 environmental change?\n\nExplores the factors driving urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions\nin selected cities.

In \naddition, an Urban sustainability in Europe - Glossary \nof key terms and concepts (EEA, forthcoming) will aim to \nhelp ensure the consistent use of terms and provide a \nharmonised reference source and resource for future \nurban sustainability assessments across the EEA. It will \ndraw on key sources, such as the Local Governments \nfor Sustainability (ICLEI), among others. \n\nThe EEA has developed, in collaboration with \nstakeholders, an overarching conceptual framework for \nurban environmental sustainability to provide the basis \nfor its assessments. This framework is based on four \nmain components: \n\n\u2022 Lenses: a range of perspectives on urban \nenvironmental sustainability that represent priority \nissues/concerns reflecting the EEA's environmental \nremit and can be used to guide/focus assessment \nand analysis.\n\n\u2022 Context: the range of current and historical, \nphysical, social and institutional characteristics, \nwhich create and shape the setting in which a \nspecific city exists, develops and functions. Each \ncity's context will have a considerable influence on \nits transition to urban environmental sustainability. \n\n\u2022 Enabling factors: relatively high-level \nforces that can facilitate (drivers) or hinder \n(barriers) the transition towards urban \nenvironmental\u00a0sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Building blocks: key qualities that contribute to \nurban environmental sustainability. Depending on \nthe context and enabling factors, different building \nblocks will be required to transition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability.\n\nThe conceptual framework can be operationalised \nusing different forms of analysis to assess urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions. The analysis \npresented in this report focuses on one initial \ndimension, an analysis of drivers and barriers to \nsupport transitions towards urban environmental \nsustainability, using enabling factors and context \nas an entry point into the discussion. Subsequent \nEEA publications will look in more detail at the other \nelements of the conceptual framework. \n\nThis report presents the results of a meta-analysis \nof the drivers and barriers of urban sustainability \ntransitions in European cities. It brings together the \nfindings from the EEA survey on urban transitions \ntowards environmental sustainability as well as the \nresults of a series of semi-structured interviews \nwith seven case-study cities that help to intensify \nand contextualise the survey results. The aim is to \nhelp improve understanding of the drivers for and \nbarriers to the achievement of urban environmental \nsustainability in Europe. The overarching objectives of \nthis report are:\n\n\u2022 to identify and analyse a selection of factors \nthat may help determine why some cities have \nbeen more successful in achieving greater \nenvironmental\u00a0sustainability;\n\n\u2022 to identify lessons about how to overcome \nbarriers and foster more sustainable urban \ndevelopment that protects environmental \nquality and creates thriving, low-carbon and \nclimate-resilient\u00a0communities.\n\nThe methodologies and analysis in this report are \nvery much an initial prototype. In the spirit of design \nthinking, where non-linear, iterative processes are used \nto try and redefine problems and identify innovative \nsolutions, this initial foray lays the groundwork for \nfuture more in-depth work on this subject. In this study, \nthe approach was tested by the EEA on a small number \nof a specific category of European cities (i.e. winners \nand finalists of two European urban sustainability \nawards). However, in future, it could usefully be refined \nand applied to a larger and/or different sample of \ncities by the EEA or other organisations interested \nin exploring urban sustainability transitions (see \nSection 5.2). This report should be seen as a first \nexploration, and an attempt to identify different \npossible methodological approaches to understanding \nthe underlying factors that either accelerate or hinder \nenvironmental sustainability transitions in cities. \n\nThis research also informs the USiE report. It aims to \nprovide some early insights into the way in which cities \nand national governments can foster more sustainable \nurban development, which protects environmental \nquality and creates thriving, low-carbon and climateresilient communities that promote economic vitality, \nhealth, well-being and social inclusion. \n\f\nIntroduction\n\n13Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nFigure 1.2  Conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\nCU\nLT\n\nURE \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGOVERNANCE  \n\n \n \n\nKNOW\nLEDGE \n\nTECH\nN\n\nOLOGY \n \n\n \n\n \nDATA AND INFORMATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFI\nN\n\nAN\nCE\n\n \n\nEnvironmental \nquality\n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nPublic \nopen space\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nEcological\nmulti\nfunctionality\n\nSustainable \nurban\n\n agriculture\n\nRenewable\nenergy\n\nLow energy\n consumption\n\nEnergy \nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial \n\nuse and zero \nwaste\n\nResource \nefficiency\n\nSustainable\nmobility\n\nGreen economy\n\nBuilt \nenvironmental\n\nquality\n\nIntegrated\nplanning\n\nHousing\nplanning\n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \n\njustice\n\nParticipation\nand\n\nempowerment\n\nCollaborative \nand \n\ncommunity-led\ninitiatives\n\nTHE\n(SUSTAINABLE)\n\nCITY\n\nLow carbon city lens\n\nCircular city lens\n\nHealthy city lens\n\nInclusive city lens\n\nGreen city lens\n\nResilient city lens\n\nLenses\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nContext (the geography of a particular city as well as \nits urban form, infrastructure, people, institutions, etc.)\n\nEnabling factors\n\nCO2\n\nCONTEXT\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n14 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n1.2 Methodological approach\n\nThe following section describes the approach that \nunderlies this research. It uses a mixed method \napproach including a  literature review, a survey and \ninterviews with city authorities to provide a well-rounded \npicture of the different factors driving environmental \nsustainability in European cities today. \n\n1.2.1 Identifying potential drivers to be tested via \nthe\u00a0survey \n\nThe survey (see Appendix A) is structured around a \nseries of potential drivers and barriers (actions that \nare 'supporting or inhibiting' transitions to urban \nenvironmental sustainability) that were identified \nduring the feasibility study. These, in turn, are grouped \nunder the context and enabling factors defined within \nthe urban environmental sustainability conceptual \nframework (i.e. governance, culture, finance, knowledge, \ndata and information, and technology). See Section 1.1.1 \nfor an overview of the conceptual framework for urban \nenvironmental sustainability. \n\nTesting these enabling factors empirically through \nsurveys and interviews also confirms that these \nelements of the conceptual framework for urban \nsustainability sufficiently capture the main driving \nforces that impact sustainability outcomes in cities.\n\nAn initial set of drivers related to each enabling \nfactor was proposed before being tested and \nrefined\u00a0through\tdiscussions\tand\tfeedback\tfrom\tthe\t\nEEA and external stakeholders. The initial list was then \nsupplemented through a review of academic and grey \nliterature to identify examples of the identification \nand/or assessment of drivers and barriers of urban \nsustainability\tchange\taround\tthe\u00a0world.\n\nDrivers and barriers were categorised under the six \nenabling factors identified in the overall conceptual \n\nframework. In addition, 'context' was also used to \nframe drivers and barriers to account for the wider \ncontextual factors that shape urban sustainability \noutcomes (e.g. gross domestic product (GDP) per \ncapita, climatic conditions, etc.).\n\n1.2.2 Selecting case-study cities for the survey\n\nPrevious work concluded that case-study cities would \nbe selected based on their participation in sustainability \nawards or indices. After reviewing a wide range of \npossible sustainability awards and indices, both within \nEurope and globally, the European Green Capital Award \n(EGCA) and its sister award, the European Green Leaf \nAward (EGLA), were identified as the most relevant and \nappropriate benchmarks for this research. Table 1.1 \npresents the full list of awards and rankings that were \nconsidered. Please note that this is not an exhaustive \nlist of all possible awards and rankings, but merely a \nlist of those that were identified through a literature \nreview and conversations with the EEA and the \nstakeholder\u00a0group.\t\n\nThe assessment criteria underlying these awards \nbroadly align with the core environmental \nsustainability objectives set out in key European \npolicy documents, including the Seventh Environment \nAction\tProgramme\t(7th\tEAP)\t(EC,\u00a02014).\tThe\tawards\t\nalso build on other important initiatives such as the \nEuropean Reference Framework for Sustainable Cities \n(RFSC) and the EU's wider environmental policies. As \nsuch, a closer investigation of the award-winning cities \nprovides an opportunity to assess the integration  \nof\tthe\tawards\twith\twider\tenvironmental\tpolicy\u00a0goals.\t\n\nTable 1.2 lists the winners and finalists of the awards \nchosen to help identify the cities to be surveyed. In \ntotal, there are 40 eligible case-study cities across the \ntwo awards.

It also built on work LSE Cities \nconducted together with ICLEI and the Global Green \nGrowth Institute in 2011 and 2012 to survey cities \nabout their transitions to a green economy (Rode \nand Floater, 2013). The full survey questionnaire is \nincluded in Appendix A. The survey was intended to \nbe fairly high level and designed to take respondents \nno more than 20 minutes to complete. In addition to \nasking about the general sustainability background of \neach city, the bulk of the survey comprised structured \nquestions asking respondents to provide more details \non the factors they deemed most significant in having \npromoted (or hindered) a shift towards greater \nenvironmental sustainability in their city.\n\nWith the support of the European Commission's DG \nEnvironment (which manage both awards) and the \nEEA, contacts were identified in 40 cities to ensure \nthat the survey was addressed to the most relevant \ncity officials. While the general background of the \nsurvey respondents was collected and analysed (see \nSection\u00a02.1),\tno\tdifferentiation\twas\tmade\tbetween\t\npolitical and technical staff, and city officials were \nallowed to nominate a colleague if they felt he or \nshe would be better suited to completing the survey. \nThe EGCA and EGLA networks were used to reach \nout to these individuals. Individual emails and up to \nthree follow-up emails were used to ensure that the \nsurvey\tbenefited\tfrom\ta\thigh\tresponse\trate\t(65\u00a0%,\tsee\t\nSection\u00a02.1).\t\n\n1.2.4 Selection of cities for semi-structured interviews\n\nFollowing completion of the survey and analysis of \nits results, semi-structured interviews were carried \nout among a selection of cities that responded to the \nsurvey. While it would have been ideal to interview \nall cities that completed the survey, these interviews \nare very resource intensive and such an effort would \nhave been beyond the scope of this relatively small, \nexploratory pilot project. \n\nIn total, seven cities were interviewed. They were \nselected to provide a geographical distribution across \neastern, western, northern and southern Europe and \nto\tinclude\tlarger\tcities\t(above\t100\u00a0000\tinhabitants\t\n\u2014 drawn from the EGCA respondents) and smaller \ncities/towns\t(between\t20\u00a0000\tand\t100\u00a0000\tinhabitants\t\n\u2014 drawn from the EGLA respondents), see Table 1.3. \nWhile attempts were made to contact a large western \nEuropean city from the survey respondents, it was not \npossible to arrange an interview before the end of the \nresearch period. All interviews were conducted with \njust a single city representative, with the exception of \nGabrovo, Bulgaria, where the interview was conducted \nwith two individuals. \n\n# City Country Category Number of inhabitants*  \n(rounded to the nearest thousand)\n\n1 Leuven Belgium Small western 100\u00a0000\n\n2 Stockholm Sweden Large northern 976\u00a0000\n\n3 Mikkeli Finland Small northern 49\u00a0000\n\n4 Lisbon Portugal Large southern 548\u00a0000\n\n5 Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat Spain Small southern 87\u00a0000\n\n6 Tallinn Estonia Large eastern 427\u00a0000\n\n7 Gabrovo Bulgaria Small eastern 108\u00a0000\n\nNotes:  *\tThe\tfigures\tpresented\tare\tfrom\tvarious\tsources\tand\tnot\tall\tfrom\tthe\tsame\tyear\t(e.g.\tUNdata,\tEurostat,\tmunicipal\tcensus\tdata).\tThey\t\nare\tshown\tto\tgive\ta\trough\timpression\tof\tcurrent\tcities'\tsizes\tand\tdo\tnot\tnecessarily\treflect\tthe\texact\tnumber\tof\tinhabitants.\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n17Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n1.2.5 Focus of the semi-structured interviews\n\nThe interviews allowed for a more nuanced \nunderstanding of key enablers, drivers and barriers \nto sustainability transitions in European cities. The \nobjective of the semi-structured interviews was to \ncomplement the findings from the survey and enable \na more profound examination of some of the specific \ndrivers and barriers identified as playing a major role in \nshaping their transition towards greater environmental \nsustainability. The questions were developed and \nagreed in consultation with the EEA and in conjunction \nwith feedback from the external stakeholders (see \nAppendix B for the interview questions).\n\nThe interviews identified concrete examples of how \nindividual cities have been able to use a range of \nenabling factors to their advantage and overcome \nspecific barriers to achieve their policy objectives. This \nprovided transferable lessons, which will be relevant for \nother European cities that may be at earlier stages of \ntheir sustainability journey. They highlighted patterns \nthat are common to all cities, and also clarified whether \nany of the drivers identified as significant via the \nsurvey are more essential than others. The interviews \nalso provided deeper insights regarding the enabling \nconditions at national and EU level that can provide \ncities with the relevant framework to fully realise their \nenvironmental sustainability potential.\n\n1.2.6 Integration of the interview results\n\nWhen all the interviews had been completed, findings \nwere analysed to identify any interesting patterns \nacross all seven case-study cities, including major \ndifferences and similarities in the drivers and barriers \nidentified. These were then used to complement the \nsurvey results. Combined with the literature review \non enabling factors, the interviews rounded out the \nanalysis and provided a perspective of the importance \nof various enabling factors for achieving greater urban \nenvironmental sustainability. \n\n1.3 Reflections on the research \nmethodology\n\nThere are important limitations to this research. As this \nis a relatively small-scale pilot study, the results should \nnot be seen as capturing the full spectrum of drivers and \nbarriers experienced by the case-study cities. The sample \nof cities both for the survey and the interviews is also not \nrepresentative of all European cities. This study is an initial \nattempt to provide insights into the relative importance \nof different enabling factors and barriers in the context of \nurban environmental sustainability. As such, its primary \n\npurpose is to open up the conversation rather than to \nprovide definitive answers to these complex questions. \nWhat it is able to show is whether there are commonalities \nin the factors that have helped different cities to transition \nmore rapidly or more successfully towards environmental \nsustainability. The work is based on the expert opinions \nof a small number of municipal employees and, as such, \nis inevitably biased to some extent. It is a subjective \nassessment of relative importance rather than an objective \nbreakdown of every single factor that may have helped or \nhindered a city's progress.\n\nSelection bias\n\n\u2022 Factors listed in the survey and discussed in the \ninterviews were identified as important for urban \nenvironmental sustainability through the literature \nreview as well as consultations with external \nstakeholders during the preliminary stages of this \nproject. It is therefore not surprising that the factors \nlisted were mainly recognised as supporting cities' \nenvironmental sustainability transitions. \n\n\u2022 All cities participating in this research were either \nwinners or finalists of two fairly prestigious awards \nand can in many ways be seen as leaders as regards \nsustainability. This might also contribute to the \noverall positive view of the importance of the factors \ntested. Nevertheless, the findings reveal that even in \ncities that are doing well in terms of achieving urban \nsustainability there are still barriers and challenges \nto overcome. \n\n\u2022 In most instances, one person from each of the \ncase-study cities participated in the interviews. \nWhile the interviewees' responses were fact \nchecked wherever possible, many elements of the \nkey drivers and barriers discussed and presented in \nthis report inevitably remain subjective by nature. \nThus, some statements may reflect a particular \nperspective of the individual interviewed. \n\nSample size\n\n\u2022 Given the relatively small sample size (26 cities \nfor the survey and a subset of seven cities for the \ninterviews), the analysis focuses on the overall \nresults and does not try to compare results by \ngeographic region or city size since any inferences \ndrawn from this would be of limited use. Future \nstudies should consider expanding the sample and \nensuring it is more geographically diverse, which \nwould enable interesting comparisons of drivers \nand barriers based on city types. \n\f\nIntroduction\n\n18 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n\u2022 While the most important supporting/inhibiting \nfactors have been identified for the purpose of \nthe survey, it should be noted that sometimes the \ndifferences between these top factors and the \nrest are only minimal. This is probably due to the \nrelatively small sample and comparatively uniform \nprofile of the cities.\n\nPrioritisation\n\n\u2022 Factors not identified through the survey as \n'key' should not necessarily be dismissed as \nless important. The same may be true for the \ninterview results where the fact that a particular \nfactor was not raised should not be taken to mean \nthat this factor is not important in that particular \nurban context, merely that it did not arise during \nthe\u00a0conversation.\t\n\n\u2022 The survey did not ask cities to rank the different \nfactors in terms of their relative importance. \nThis makes it impossible to say whether any of \nthe overarching enabling factors played a more \nessential role in a city's sustainability story. Given \nthat the survey was completed by a single individual \n(albeit often with input from a wider team of \npeople) this focus on prioritising factors was seen as \ntoo\u00a0subjective.\t\n\n\u2022 The relative importance of different drivers and \nbarriers was discussed during the semi-structured \ninterviews, in the context of specific sustainability \nchallenges the city has faced. However, it is \nimportant to keep in mind that these assessments \nare subjective and cannot provide a full and \nobjective overview of complex causal feedback \n\nloops between inputs, outputs and outcomes of \nsustainability actions. \n\n\u2022 Presentation of the discussion on the key drivers of \nurban sustainability transitions (Section 2.2) mirrors \nthe layout of the survey and serves the purpose of \nstructuring the report. The ordering of factors in \nthis way does not suggest any kind of hierarchy of \nimportance. Furthermore, the demarcation of the \nfactors does not reflect how they exist in reality. \nThese factors are not isolated components but \noverlap and interlink with each other to create a \ncity's surrounding context and to influence their \nurban sustainability transitions. \n\nCorrelation vs. causation\n\n\u2022 One of the reasons why it is so challenging to \npinpoint the exact factors that drive environmental \nsustainability in cities is because it can be very \ndifficult to demonstrate causality within complex \nurban systems. Many factors shape sustainability \noutcomes and it can be difficult sometimes to know \nif they are the actual reason that change takes place \nor just a correlating factor. \n\n\u2022 Complex causal feedback loops also mean that it is \nsometimes difficult to know if a particular factor was \nprimarily an input to or an outcome of a particular \npolicy. A good example of this is urban form, which \ncan act as both a contextual driver of environmental \nsustainability (e.g. by making the inner city \nwalkable) or an outcome of specific environmental \nsustainability (e.g. policies that encourage urban \ndensification and mixed land use).\n\f\n19\n\nAbout the cities\n\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n2 About the cities\n\nThis section provides a brief overview of the cities \nthat participated in the survey and the interviews. \nAfter completing the survey, seven of these cities \n(Leuven, Stockholm, Mikkeli, Lisbon, Cornell\u00e0 de \nLlobregat, Tallinn and Gabrovo) were interviewed \n\nto provide a more nuanced understanding of what \ndrives urban environmental sustainability transitions \nin some European cities.

Figure 2.4 shows the challenges most \nfrequently identified as significant for the cities \nand their wider regions: Severe storms and flooding \n(identified by all survey respondents); decline of native \nspecies/natural habitats; air pollution (identified by \nthe highest number of cities as a 'very significant' \nchallenge); storm water management; noise pollution; \nand heatwaves. Naturally, most cities face many \ndifferent environmental challenges simultaneously, \nsome of which (such as heatwaves, air pollution and \nlack of green space) may compound one another, \nmaking disaster risk management and mitigation more \ncomplicated. Although the survey did not explore these \ninteractions in more detail, this is an important area \nfor further study, to identify interventions that can \n\nFigure 2.4  Responses to survey question 'How significant are the following environmental challenges for \nyour city and its region?'\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n7\n\n3\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n8\n\n13\n\n15\n\n8\n\n12\n\n2\n\n3\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n8\n\n7\n\n11\n\n12\n\n10\n\n14\n\n11\n\n14\n\n13\n\n10\n\n12\n\n16\n\n16\n\n11\n\n9\n\n17\n\n14\n\n22\n\n21\n\n17\n\n17\n\n17\n\n13\n\n12\n\n11\n\n11\n\n10\n\n8\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n7\n\n6\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nTimber, mineral and other natural resource shortages\n\nFood shortages/access to food\n\nLand/soil erosion\n\nClean drinking water\n\nEnergy shortages/scarcity\n\nForest fires\n\nWater pollution\n\nSea level rise\n\nSolid waste disposal\n\nSewage treatment and disposal\n\nLight pollution\n\nLack/loss of ecologically productive land\n\nSolid waste processing\n\nGround contamination\n\nLack/loss of green space\n\nWater shortages/droughts\n\nHeat waves\n\nNoise pollution\n\nStormwater management\n\nAir Pollution\n\nDecline of native species/ natural habitats\n\nSevere storms and flooding\n\nFrequency of responses\n\nVery significant Somewhat significant Not significant I don\u2019t know No answer\n\nhave co-benefits across many different environmental \nchallenges that cities may be facing. \n\nWater shortages/droughts, ground contamination, \nsolid-waste processing, lack/loss of ecologically productive \nland, and light pollution also pose a challenge for most \nof\tthe\u00a0cities.\t\n\nTimber, mineral and other natural resource shortages \nand food shortages/access to food are the two \nchallenges the cities mostly frequently identified as \nnot significant, followed by land/soil erosion, clean \ndrinking water and energy shortages/scarcity. While \nthis survey indicates that some challenges were only \nconsidered significant by a few cities, it is important to \nnote that four cities face food-related challenges and \nabout a third of the cities are tackling energy shortages/\nscarcity and drinking water issues. Since the research \n\f\nAbout the cities\n\n23Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nwas completed before cities were confronted with \nthe various challenges brought on by the coronavirus \npandemic, it would be interesting to repeat the \nsurvey now to see whether some issues, such as food \nshortages/access to food, have risen up their agendas. \n\nThe environmental challenges highlighted by the \nsurvey also emerged frequently in the interviews. Cities \nmentioned the importance of dealing with stormwater \nmanagement and flooding (e.g. Lisbon, Portugal and \nStockholm, Sweden), increasingly frequent droughts \nand lack of water, dangerous levels of air pollution, \nheatwaves (e.g. Stockholm) and urban heat island \neffects (e.g. Tallinn, Estonia), and lack of green spaces \n(e.g. Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Spain). \n\nIt should also be noted that not all of the challenges \nidentified are within the immediate remit of city \ngovernments as some may be shaped by higher \ntiers of government or external forces beyond the \ncity's control. Thus, understanding what cities can \neffectively influence (and what requires input from \nother governments, the private sector or the public) \nis an important part of designing successful urban \nsustainability strategies.\n\n2.3 Emergence of environmental \nsustainability objectives\n\nFigure 2.5 presents the survey responses on how long \nenvironmental sustainability objectives have been part \nof the political agenda of responding cities. Over half \nof the cities surveyed have considered environmental \n\nsustainability objectives as an important part of their \npolitical agenda during the period between 1992 (the \nRio Conference) and 2000, which means they have had \nseveral decades to mainstream these considerations \ninto their wider policy-making processes. The \nsecond largest group of cities have only considered \nsustainability in their policies since the turn of the \nmillennium (2001-2019). A few 'early mover' cities \nindicated that this agenda emerged in the period \nbetween 1973 and 1992, and two cities since before \nthe\u00a0Stockholm\tUN\tconference\tin\t1972.\t\n\nIn the interviews, several cities mentioned that \nenvironmental sustainability has only really emerged \nas an important priority in their cities over the past \n10 years or so. Tallinn highlighted the national \ngovernment's changing relationship with the EU in \nthe past year as having removed a previous barrier \nto greater sustainability. For Gabrovo, the accession \nof Bulgaria to the EU was a core factor that pushed \nsustainability up the political agenda. For Lisbon, it \nwas the election of a new government following the \nfinancial crisis in 2008/2009. In Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, \nthe influence of the metropolitan area of Barcelona has \naccelerated progress on sustainability in the past 10 \nyears. Other cities, such as Stockholm, suggested that \nintegration of environmental sustainability had begun \nin the wider urban decision-making process many \ndecades ago. All cities highlighted a renewed urgency \nin recent years due to climate change and various \nassociated international and national targets.\n\nFigure 2.5  Responses to survey question 'How long have environmental sustainability objectives been an \nimportant part of your city's political agenda?'\n\n15 %\n\n54 %\n\n11 %\n\n8 %\n\n12 % Only in the last decades (2001-2019)\n\nSince the period between 1992 (The Rio Conference) and\n2000\n\nSince the period between 1973 (the Oil Crisis) and 1992\n\nSince before 1972 (the Stockholm UN Conference)\n\nEnvironmental sustainability objectives are an important \npart of my city\u2019s political agenda, but I can\u2019t specify when \nthey became important\n\f\nAbout the cities\n\n24 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nFigure 2.6  Responses to survey question 'How important were/are the following triggers in making \nenvironmental sustainability objectives an important part of your city's political agenda?'\n\n3\n\n7\n\n5\n\n9\n\n9\n\n13\n\n10\n\n11\n\n15\n\n11\n\n11\n\n11\n\n11\n\n8\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\n1 1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nAnother particular crisis (not related to the environment)\n\nPressure from national/supranational government\n\nPressure from stakeholders\n\nA specific environmental crisis\n\nA change in local political leadership\n\nPublic opinion/awareness\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nVery significant Somewhat significant Not significant I don\u2019t know No answer\n\nIn addition to the question about the emergence \nof environmental sustainability on their political \nagendas, two further free-form questions asked cities \nto list any specific policies that have either supported \nor undermined their sustainability objectives. The \nsupporting policies that cities identified were wideranging in terms of their scope. They included broader, \nmore strategic and longer-term factors, such as the \ndevelopment of urban master plans, or more specific \npolicies focused on one or two sustainability objectives. \nThese objectives included storm water management, \nclimate protection and greening the city. For the \nquestion on policies that undermined a city's progress, \nnone were identified by half of the survey respondents \n\u2014 they either explicitly expressed this or did not \nanswer. The policies highlighted as barriers tended to \nfocus on transport and infrastructure that perpetuate \ncar-centricity or on ways in which existing land use \nand spatial planning is hampering sustainability, such \nas through the absence of green infrastructure. The \nimpact of historical policies that have created particular \nurban form and infrastructure was a key factor also \nhighlighted in interviews (see Section 3.1). \n\n2.4 Triggers for greater environmental \nsustainability \n\nAll of the specific triggers included in the survey \nto gauge what led to environmental sustainability \nobjectives becoming an important part of cities' \n\npolitical agendas were considered significant by at \nleast half of the cities (see Figure 2.6). However, public \nopinion/awareness seems to be a key trigger that has \ndriven environmental sustainability in cities (selected \nby 24 cities). As Section 3.4 explores in more detail, \nthis was confirmed by the interviews with over half of \nall cities explicitly mentioning the importance of public \nawareness of environmental challenges. A change in \nlocal political leadership, specific environmental crises \nand pressure from stakeholders were also identified as \nbeing important triggers, each being considered very \nsignificant or significant by 20 or more cities. This was \nconfirmed by the interviews, in which growing public \nawareness of environmental issues as well as the \npolitical vision of individual leaders were repeatedly \nhighlighted as important triggers. \n\nOn the whole, cities did not feel that another particular \ncrisis (not related to the environment) was a significant \ntrigger in making environmental sustainability \nobjectives an important part of their political agenda. \nIt would be interesting to see whether cities might \nevaluate this differently in the context of COVID-19. \nResearch into the impacts of COVID-19 is currently \nexploring to what extent the health crisis might be \nacting as a trigger for wider sustainability transitions \nin\u00a0cities.\n\f\n25\n\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n3 Understanding the factors that \nshape urban environmental \nsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\nThe following section explores some of the key drivers \nof and barriers to urban environmental sustainability \nin European cities. In line with the conceptual \nframework for urban environmental sustainability (see \nSection 1.1.1.), the drivers and barriers investigated \nare structured under context (i.e. distinct context of \nevery city) and a set of six 'enabling factors', including \ngovernance, knowledge, culture, technology, data \nand information, and finance. To allow for a more \ndetailed analysis of how the enabling factors might act \nas either drivers or barriers, they were disaggregated \ninto more specific factors in the survey. While many \nof these factors were discussed during the interviews, \nthe analysis focuses on the most salient points \nemerging from those conversations, highlighting \ninstances where the interviews either confirmed \nor contradicted the survey findings. The analysis is \nbased on the findings from the survey as well as the \nperspectives of individual interviewees in the casestudy cities. \n\nIt is important to note that a factor might be seen \nas a driver by one city and a barrier by another, \nwhich may also change depending on the specific \ncontext. This analysis does not explicitly explore how \ndifferent drivers and barriers relate to each other. \nHowever, interlinkages and frictions between various \nsupporting and inhibiting factors are areas that require \nfurther research, with drivers and barriers potentially \ncombining to create either virtuous or vicious cycles \nin relation to a city's progress towards greater \nenvironmental sustainability. \n\n3.1 Context\n\nEvery city has its own distinct context that will influence \nthe nature of its urban sustainability transition. \nContextual factors will influence the potential for, and \nmay act to limit the options of, a city when it comes to \nenvironmental transformations that are feasible. \n\nFor the purpose of this report, context refers to the \nrange of current and historic physical (e.g. geographic, \nenvironmental), cultural and institutional characteristics \nthat create and shape the setting in which a specific city \nexists, develops and functions. \n\nThese characteristics may be relatively stable and slow \nto alter but can also be dynamic and changeable. While \nfactors such as natural assets tend to be relatively fixed, \nothers such as existing infrastructure and demographics \nare more variable. In addition, a contextual factor \nthat is a key driver in one city may be less relevant in \nanother. Even within a specific city, contexts may vary \ndepending on the specific neighbourhood (e.g. inner \ncity vs. suburb). It is therefore vital that cities carefully \nconsider their unique contexts to understand how they \nmay influence their urban sustainability transition. \n\nA diverse array of contextual factors drives urban \nsustainability transitions\n\nContextual factors influence what kinds of sustainability \nissues are prioritised by a city and provide insight \ninto the motivations that drive particular actions. \nFactors such as geographic location and vulnerability to \nclimate-related extreme weather events can significantly \ninfluence the likelihood that cities will be proactive \non mitigation and adaptation planning (Reckien et \nal., 2015). The literature suggests that motivation \nfor sustainability actions may be just as much about \neconomic and employment growth as it is about \nimproving environmental performance (Joss, 2011). \nThis recognition of co-benefits also emerged as a \nrecurring theme in the interviews.\n\nIn the survey, the contextual factors considered to \nsupport sustainability transitions most strongly were \nexisting infrastructure and air/water/soil quality followed \nby city size and natural assets. \n\nExisting urban form, structure of the economy and \ndemographics were the most frequently selected \nas inhibiting factors (see Figure 3.1). Some survey \nrespondents noted that factor(s) can be supporting \nand inhibiting at the same time. For example, factors \nsuch as existing urban form (e.g. compactness) or \ngeographic location may support some environmental \ninitiatives\t(e.g.\u00a0promotion\tof\tsustainable\tmobility)\tbut\t\nmay negatively impact other objectives (e.g. improving \nair quality, increasing the share of accessible green \nareas). These responses demonstrate that a wide range \nof contextual factors can drive urban sustainability in \ndifferent ways.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n26 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nDemographic change is both a challenge and an \nopportunity for environmental sustainability \n\nEurope as a whole is faced with the issues of ageing \nand declining populations, and these impacts \nare unevenly distributed across European cities \n(EEA,\u00a02019).\tAlthough\tglobally,\turban\tpopulations\t\nare continuing to grow at an exponential rate, in \nEurope, urbanisation rates have slowed considerably \nand growth tends to be focused in larger cities, with \nmany smaller cities and rural areas experiencing \nor projected to experience a contraction in \ntheir\tpopulation\tof\tup\tto\t30\u00a0%\t(Vandecasteele\t\net\u00a0al.,\u00a02019,\u00a0EEA,\t2020).\t\n\nThe survey results indicated that demographics is one \nof the most polarising contextual factors. This finding \nwas echoed in interviews (see Box 3.1). The interviews \nsuggested that urbanisation and population pressures \nintensified environmental challenges in cities by \nincreasing housing needs and putting green spaces at \nrisk. This is not just because of actual urbanisation, but \n\nalso due to consumer preferences and planning and \nzoning laws. Across Europe, urban sprawl continues to \nbe a major challenge, even in countries with declining \npopulations, with housing, industry and infrastructure \ndevelopment continuing to put pressure on peri-urban \nland (EEA, 2016). \n\nCities also spoke of how challenges related to an \nageing, shrinking or sparse population have inhibited \nurban sustainability transitions. This has had a number \nof impacts. For instance, public transport systems are \nchallenging to organise and implement in areas of the \ncity with lower population densities. \n\nThe interviews revealed that the way in which \ndemographics acts as an inhibiting factor varies across \ncities and reflects differences in trends across Europe. \nLike all factors, demographics takes on a different \nresonance when combined with the other contextual \nfactors that shape a city's urban sustainability \ntransition. In some instances, these challenges can \nbring\topportunities\tto\tfurther\tsuch\u00a0transitions.\n\nFigure 3.1   Responses to survey question 'Have the following contextual factors supported or inhibited the \nenvironmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n12\n\n12\n\n6\n\n7\n\n11\n\n9\n\n7\n\n11\n\n11\n\n6\n\n11\n\n6\n\n6\n\n14\n\n11\n\n7\n\n11\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n7\n\n5\n\n5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nLevel of gentrification\n\nDemographics\n\nStructure of the economy\n\nGeographic location\n\nExisting urban form\n\nClimatic conditions\n\nGDP per capita\n\nNatural assets\n\nCity size\n\nAir/water/soil quality\n\nExisting infrastructure\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n27Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nExisting grey infrastructure can lock cities into particular \ndevelopment pathways\n\nLike demographics, existing grey infrastructure is more \ndynamic and changeable than stable contextual factors, \nsuch as certain natural assets, climatic conditions and, \nmost importantly, geographic location. Of course, even \nnatural assets, like forests, rivers, arable land or public \ngreen spaces, are changeable to an extent, given that \nblue and green infrastructure is also shaped by human \ndecisions and land-use changes. Understanding what \ncan and cannot be changed, and how to tailor policies \nto take advantage of and adapt current infrastructure, \nis a powerful tool that cities should not underestimate. \nIt varies greatly across cities: for example, in the \nbuilding sector, efficient policy implementation will \ndepend on the state of the existing building stock \n(e.g.\u00a0age,\ttype,\ttenure,\tetc.),\tspeed\tof\tnew\tconstruction\t\nand renovation, and the capacity and skills of the \nconstruction industry. \n\nIn the interviews, the majority of cities spoke about \ngrey infrastructure in the context of improvement plans \nand local government visions for the creation of a more \nsustainable city. Some of the initiatives highlighted \ninclude: introducing electric buses; adding cycling \ninfrastructure and pedestrianising streets; improving \nwaste systems; and retrofitting buildings. \n\nInfrastructure improvements were both implicitly or \nexplicitly linked to historic developments that created \nurban environments and systems now requiring \n\nsignificant changes to align them with sustainability \nobjectives. Cities gave examples of the kinds of \ninfrastructure and associated plans and policies \nthat, at times, have inhibited urban sustainability \ntransitions. These include outdated water and \nsewage systems, decades of car-centric planning, \nand the absence of green and blue infrastructure. \nGenerally, cities identified existing grey infrastructure \nas a challenge that needs to be overcome to \nfurther their transition, although in some cities, this \ninfrastructure has turned out to be a positive driver \n(see Box 3.2). This demonstrates that contemporary \nurban environments are often rooted in historic \npolicies and plans, models and traditions that differ \nfrom the sustainability principles that may guide \ndecision-making today. \n\nAlthough infrastructure can act as a barrier to \ntransitions in cities, it is also a contextual factor that \ncan be altered. Infrastructure is one factor that cities \ncan directly influence, which may explain its status in \nthe survey as the top supporting factor. The interviews \nsuggested that infrastructure can be repurposed \nto support contemporary sustainability objectives. \nFor example, even after decades of car-centric \ndevelopment in cities, steps can be taken to stop the \npromotion of car dependency and to expand public \ntransport networks and cycling routes.\n\nBox 3.1 Reversing brain drain seen as key to sustainable future for Gabrovo\n\nGabrovo\t(Bulgaria)\tis\ta\trelatively\tsmall\tcity\t(>\u00a060\u00a0000\tresidents)\twith\tan\tindustrial\tpast\tin\tthe\tcentre\tof\tthe\tcountry.\tAn\tageing\t\npopulation and the 'brain drain' caused by the migration of younger residents were identified as the biggest challenges \nfacing the city. The brain drain problem involves young people leaving for bigger cities where there are more employment \nopportunities\tand\thigher\tsalaries\tin\tBulgaria\tor\tother\u00a0EU\tcountries.\t\n\nRecognising these contextual challenges, which are rooted in Bulgaria's history and decades of deindustrialisation, \nGabrovo has decided to tap into its entrepreneurial spirit and natural assets to advance the city's green agenda and make \nitself more attractive to the younger generation. Energy efficiency improvements and upgrades to the transport system \nas well as maintenance of the city's green and public spaces have been central to this.

Gabrovo has also \nworked closely with local businesses and educational establishments to ensure that skills development and employment \nopportunities are expanded locally. It ranks second after Sofia for economic and social development, with steadily rising \nwages and low unemployment rates (URBACT, n.d.).\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n28 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nCities need to work around their fixed contextual factors \nto find solutions that work for them\n\nContextual factors that cities are less able to influence \n(e.g. climate, geography) can restrict sustainable \npolicy options and create barriers that are difficult \nto overcome. During the interviews, Mikkeli, Finland, \nnoted how their freezing, wintry climate presents a \nbarrier to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles \nbecause cold weather drains the vehicles' batteries and \ncauses a loss of range. Lisbon's hilly terrain has limited \nthe expansion of cycling as a popular transport mode, \nalthough the increased popularity of electric bicycles is \nhelping the city to overcome this barrier. Although such \nfactors themselves are essentially fixed, whether they \nsupport or inhibit urban sustainability transitions varies \naccording to the city and its particular geographical \nsetting (see Box 3.3).\n\nBox 3.2 Historic infrastructure investments ensure low-carbon heating for Stockholm\n\nStockholm (Sweden) is a good example of a city where an historic infrastructure decision is currently supporting the \ncity's sustainability objectives. Forty years ago, after the 1973 OPEC crisis sent oil prices through the roof, Stockholm \ndeveloped a vast network of underground district heating. Today, the city has 28 000 km of underground pipes connecting \nover\t10\u00a0000\u00a0buildings\t(Beatley,\t2017).\tThe\tdistrict\theating\tsystem\twas,\tand\tremains,\tan\tattractive\toption\tbecause\tof\tits\t\nconvenience\tand\tcompetitive\tprices\t(Ericsson,\u00a02009).\n\nFrom a climate mitigation perspective, this district heating system is crucial to Stockholm's sustainability transition. It now \nuses biofuels, household waste and heat recovered from Stockholm's data centres and industries (Beatley, 2017; WePower, \n2020). In addition to producing much lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional gas or electric heating, it does \nnot use 'above ground' combustion, which has greatly improved the city's air quality. This example demonstrates how historic \ninfrastructure decisions can lock cities into particular sustainability pathways \u2014 for better or worse.\n\nBox\t3.3\t Urban\tsustainability\ttransitions:\tpossible\tin\tboth\t'grey'\tand\t'green'\u00a0contexts\t\n\nGabrovo (Bulgaria) emphasised that proximity to nature has been a significant driver in its sustainability story. Being \nsurrounded by mountains and forest and a pristine river has created a predisposition among citizens to protect the \nenvironment, which the municipality can tap into as it advances its sustainability transition. \n\nIn\tcontrast\twith\tGabrovo,\twhere\tforests\tcover\tover\t50\u00a0%\tthe\tcity's\tterritory\t(URBACT,\tn.d.),\tin\tCornell\u00e0 de Llobregat (part of \nthe\twider\tBarcelona\tmetropolitan\tarea),\tonly\taround\t12\u00a0%\tof\tthe\tcity\tis\tmade\tup\tof\tnatural\tareas\t(URBACT,\tn.d.;\tCornell\u00e0 de \nLlobregat Municipality, 2019). Yet in this case, the absence of natural assets and the higher urban density it enables are seen \nas positive drivers of sustainability. Rather than letting this lack of green space create a barrier, the city has embraced its dense \nurban fabric as a characteristic that can bring many benefits through high transport accessibility and the proximity of urban \nfunctions while still investing in green and blue infrastructure. Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat hopes to be an inspiration for other highly \ncompact municipalities around Europe by showing that this characteristic can actually be a positive driver for sustainability. \nBoth cities have recognised where their strengths lie and have been making the most of their natural assets and existing urban \nform to further their urban sustainability transitions.\n\nUnderstanding the complex causal relationships \nbetween context and sustainability efforts can help \ncities prioritise the most appropriate environmental \npolicies for their individual circumstances. The survey \nonly tested a small number of the potentially myriad \ncontextual factors. Although a contextual factor that \nacts as a major barrier in one city may be largely \nirrelevant in another, what emerges clearly from \nthe research is that a good understanding of a city's \ncontext is an essential prerequisite to successful \nsustainability planning. Knowing that most aspects of a \ncity's context are changeable (either through targeted \npolicy intervention or by means of more large-scale \nexternal forces such as climate change) is also an \nimportant reminder that cities are living systems, \nconstantly evolving and in a state of flux, and that \npolicy-making must remain agile to respond to future \nchallenges. \n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n29Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n3.2 Governance \n\nIt is increasingly acknowledged that cities are key actors \nin implementing the EU's low-carbon economy and \nresource-efficiency objectives (EEA, 2019). They are \ncrucial to improving waste and water management, \npublic transport, adapting to climate change and \nenabling an efficient use of land by implementing \nintegrated urban planning (EEA, 2015). As part of a \nwider trend (which is mainly evident in larger cities \ngaining autonomy and setting social and economic \nstandards), city networks and associations are \nbecoming increasingly important in shaping global \nclimate and sustainability agreements (EEA, 2020). \nDespite the central role of urban authorities, they \ncannot tackle the complex challenges of urban \nsustainability transitions without the support of \nregional, national and supranational governments. \nAlongside this need for multi-level governance across \nthe traditional structures of government, there is also \nrecognition that the governance of transitions requires \na redrawing of the boundaries between the state and \nsociety (Ehnert et al., 2018). This does not mean that \ngovernment institutions do not continue to play an \nimportant role, but rather that effective governance of \ncomplex sustainability issues relies on collaboration \nwith actors from academia, research, business and the \nrest of civil society (EEA and Eionet, 2016).\n\nEuropean citizens are extremely concerned about \nclimate change and the environment (EC, 2019b) and \nbelieve their actions towards environmental protection \nmatter (EC, 2017). This enables more proactive \ninvolvement of EU institutions and Member States in \nenvironmental matters and stronger engagement and \nsupport of citizens and local stakeholders for measures \ntaken by the EU and national governments (EEA, 2019). \n\nFor the purpose of this report, governance refers to \nthe structures and processes as well as the norms, \nvalues and rules through which affairs are conducted \nby political, business or community leaders exercising \ntheir authority. \n\n3.2.1 EU governance \n\nAnalysis of the survey results and interviews suggests \nthat the EU and its institutions, initiatives and networks \nmake vital contributions to sustainability transitions \nin European cities. For example, an interviewee \nfrom Tallinn stated that, in the last year, Estonia's \nstrengthened relationship with the EU has led to \nsignificant changes in its national government agenda, \nwhich now prioritises becoming climate neutral. \nConsequently, there is now strong national support \nfor environmental initiatives in Estonia's cities. There \nis also greater support for environmental policies and \nprojects, as public opinion has shifted in favour of more \nenvironmentally sound development. The interviewee \nsuggested that political as well as public resistance \nto sustainability transitions seems to be declining. \nSimilarly to Tallinn, an interviewee from Gabrovo also \nattributed positive cultural changes in public opinion \nand engagement to EU membership.\n\nEU legislation supports cities' environmental and \nsustainability efforts\n\nIn the survey analysis, international treaties and EU laws, \nstandards and regulations stand out as key supporting \nfactors. These are considered as (either strongly or \nslightly) supporting by more than two thirds of the \ncities. This is also reflected in the interview results, \nwhich suggest that cities largely use EU strategies, \n\nBox 3.4  How COVID-19 may be impacting contextual drivers and barriers \n\nBoth existing infrastructure and current urban form are likely to be shaped significantly by the coronavirus pandemic, \nas a result of consumer preferences and active government intervention. Huge reductions in public transport use have \nbeen observed in most European cities, as many people are working from home. At the same time, there has been an \nincrease in the use of private cars. However, the reduction in public transport use in many cities has been accompanied by \nrenewed investment in walking and cycling infrastructure and resurging debates about the value of accessibility and the \n'15-minute city'. Going against this trend, the preference for single-family detached housing with private gardens persists \nin many European cities. In the wake of COVID-19, social distancing requirements and greater home working may lead \nto a perpetuation of this more sprawling urbanisation pattern, with potentially significant implications for environmental \nsustainability and land-use change. \n\nAir quality is another contextual factor that has been hugely impacted by the pandemic, with many cities experiencing \nsignificant reductions in air pollution as a result of the lockdown restrictions. While pollution has rebounded as cities \nhave opened up again, it seems likely that the experience of such drastic improvements in air quality will shape people's \npreferences in the future.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n30 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nlaws, standards and regulations to better implement \nenvironmental legislation and as a roadmap when \ndeveloping their plans and policies. \n\nFor example, the changes that are being made to the \nLisbon Municipal Master Plan (Portugal) are guided \nby the European Green Deal. The Green Deal has also \nbeen welcomed by Leuven (Belgium) to enable better \nalignment of different sectoral policies, boost its efforts \nto encourage sustainable mobility and, more broadly, \nto support the city's sustainability transition. Most \ninterviewees mentioned that EU Directives such as the \nWater Framework Directive (WFD), Energy Efficiency \nDirective (EED) and Energy Performance of Buildings \nDirective (EPBD) are important in implementing \nenvironmental legislation and driving environmental \ntechnological innovations (e.g. nature-based solutions \n(NBS), smart grids, e-vehicles) in water, transport, \nhousing, construction and waste-management sectors \nin their cities.\n\nInitiatives and networks supported by the EU inspire \npositive actions\n\nMost of the cities interviewed said that they benefit \nfrom membership of networks established and \nsupported by the EU, a finding also noted in the survey \nresults (see Section 3.3 Knowledge). Interviewees \noften mentioned the EU Covenant of Mayors and \nthe European Committee of the Regions (CoR) as \npositive factors in their transition. The Covenant \nof Mayors for Climate & Energy (1) brings together \nmore\tthan\t10\u00a0000\u00a0local\tgovernments\tin\tEurope\t\nvoluntarily committed to implementing EU climate \nand energy objectives. The European CoR is the \nEU's assembly of local and regional representatives, \nwhich provides sub-national authorities (i.e. regions, \ncounties, provinces, municipalities and cities) with a \ndirect voice within the EU's institutional framework. \nFor example, Gabrovo recognises the support of the \nCoR for their policy-making processes at the national, \nregional and local level. Several cities (e.g. Lisbon, \nCornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Tallinn) say that membership \nof the Covenant of Mayors is crucial to their energy \nand climate agenda. The importance of city networks \nand peer-to-peer learning is further discussed in the \nknowledge section of this report (see Section 3.3 \nKnowledge).\n\nQuite a few interviewees mentioned that the European \nCommission's urban sustainability awards EGLA \nand EGCA had been an inspiration and a catalyst for \nenvironmental changes in their cities, driving efforts \nand recognising the need for better cooperation \n\namong governments, businesses and people to \nachieve environmental sustainability objectives, \nsuch as climate resilience and adaptation, energy \nefficiency, circular economy, etc. The importance of the \nawards is further discussed in the knowledge section \n(Section\u00a03.3.\u00a0Knowledge).\t\n\nBoth the survey and interviews suggest that access \nto EU funding is an important contribution to \nsustainability transitions in cities. Most mention \nbenefits received from the European Investment \nBank (EIB), EU programmes, projects and initiatives \n(e.g.\u00a0Horizon\t2020,\tClimate-KIC)\tand\tEU\tinstitutions'\t\njoint initiatives (e.g. URBACT, ELENA \u2014 a joint initiative \nof the EIB and the European Commission under the \nHorizon 2020 programme). The importance of access \nto multilateral funding is discussed in more detail in the \nfinance section (Section 3.7 Finance).\n\nThe evidence gathered in the interviews indicates that \nin comparison to international environmental initiatives \n(e.g. United Nations' Sustainable Development \nGoals \u2014 UN SDGs, New Urban Agenda), European \nregulations and initiatives are considered significantly \nmore relevant to cities when planning for sustainability \ntransitions. Although some cities acknowledge the UN \nSDGs and use them as guidance for developing their \npolicies (e.g. Stockholm, Lisbon), generally speaking, \nmore weight is given to EU initiatives and in particular \nEU legislation. Some interviewees suggested that the \nreason for this is the non-binding nature of UN and \nother international multilateral agreements.\n\nImplementing EU environmental regulations can \nbe\u00a0challenging\n\nAlthough cities have found EU governance generally \nsupportive and of significant importance to sustainability \ntransitions, the interview analysis indicates there are \nsome challenges mainly related to the implementation \nof EU legislation. Some cities mentioned financial \nchallenges: for example, Gabrovo suggested that \nproviding high-quality water and other services in \ncompliance with strict EU standards in dispersed \nand sparsely populated settlements around the city \nis very expensive. Some cities have struggled with \nimplementing EU guidance and regulations, which they \nbelieve are transposed into national law too 'literally' and \nthus are less appropriate or in conflict with cities' local \ngeographical, topographic or climatic conditions. For \nexample, Mikkeli mentioned it cannot apply the initiative \nto switch to electric transport as most of the year it is too \ncold for electric vehicles to run properly. \n\n(1) https://www.covenantofmayors.eu/en\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n31Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n3.2.2 National and regional governance\n\nThe survey results show that, in general, factors \nrelated to national and regional governance are \nseen by most cities (at least half of the respondents) \nas positive drivers of sustainability transitions (see \nFigure\u00a03.2).\tSupporting\tfactors\tfrequently\tidentified\tare\t\nnational laws, standards and regulations; distribution of \nstate powers and the level of political decentralisation; \nand actions and policy objectives of the national/state \ngovernment. All these factors are also considered \npotential barriers by a smaller number of respondents. \nThe interview results show a similar picture. \n\nMultilevel governance can support cities in managing \nstrategic sustainability actions \n\nIn relation to the distribution of state powers and level of \npolitical decentralisation, some interviewees highlighted \nthe importance of and the need for regionallevel governance when it comes to dealing with \nenvironmental issues. This is particularly important \nfor cities that are part of larger metropolitan urban \nareas where coordination between a number of closely \nlinked municipalities can be indispensable to advancing \nsustainability objectives (see Box 3.5).\n\nThe interviewee from Lisbon highlighted the need for a \nhigher-level 'Lisbon city region' administrative authority \nthat would enable policy- and decision-making across \nthe whole Lisbon metropolitan area to better manage \nstrategic decision-making, especially in relation to \ninfrastructure (e.g. roads, public transport, water \nsupply, etc.). The Lisbon metropolitan area currently \ncomprises 18 municipalities, each with their own \ndevolved powers and often competing interests, which \nsometimes hinder the achievement of sustainability \nobjectives (e.g. municipalities compete against each \nother in bidding processes for funding projects that \ncould bring substantial environmental benefits). \nWhile there has been some progress in coordinating \nmetropolitan issues among the municipalities, there is \ncurrently no metropolitan governing body. \n\nAnother challenge related to the distribution of state \npowers was mentioned by the interviewee from \nGabrovo in relation to the lack of fiscal decentralisation \nin the country and consequently limited funding and a \nsmall municipal budget. \n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n14\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n\n10\n\n11\n\n15\n\n8\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nSub-national laws, standards and regulations\n\nSub-national taxes, subsidies or other\neconomic instruments\n\nNational taxes, subsidies or other economic\ninstruments\n\nActions and policy objectives of the\nnational/state government\n\nDistribution of state powers and the level\nof political decentralisation\n\nNational laws, standards and regulations\n\nInternational treaties- and EU laws, standards\nand regulations\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\nFigure 3.2  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to national governance \nsupported or inhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n32 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nBox 3.5 Metropolitan governance supports sustainability transition in Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat\n\nSpain has a decentralised system of governance with 17 autonomous regions each having the capabilities to create laws \nand manage their own budgets, regional parliaments and even more decentralised levels of government in the form of \nprovinces and local authorities (Fernandez, 2018). As a result of this multi-level governance system, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat's \nenvironmental and urban policies are mainly coordinated with the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, the Province of \nBarcelona and, most importantly, the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (AMB). The AMB is a public authority comprising the \ncity of Barcelona along with 36 other municipalities. It is responsible for managing territorial and urban planning, mobility, \nhousing, the environment, economic development and social cohesion (AMB, n.d.). \n\nEfforts by the AMB to comprehensively tackle the metropolitan area's environmental challenges have been one of the \nmain drivers of sustainability transitions in Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat. The municipality is part of the continuous urban area of \nBarcelona, which means it makes sense for strategic areas such as transport to be planned in an integrated way. For a small \nmunicipality\tof\tless\tthan\t100\u00a0000\tinhabitants,\tthere\tare\talso\timportant\tbenefits\tin\tbeing\tpart\tof\ta\twider\tgovernance\tsystem\t\nthat can provide support across a range of different policy sectors. \n\nEven though political parties may not be aligned across the municipal, metropolitan, provincial and regional levels, there is \nbroad cross-party agreement about the importance of acting on climate change and other shared environmental priorities. \nThis has helped to depoliticise the topic of sustainability and to ensure continuity in the strategic vision for all municipalities \nin the wider metropolitan area.\n\nLegislation and actions of national governments \ngenerally support cities' sustainability ambitions\n\nNational laws, standards and regulations also make \nan important contribution to cities' sustainability \ntransitions. As suggested by the interviewee from \nTallinn, the recent change in the national government \nagenda committing to the environmental goal to \nbecome carbon neutral by 2050 is a catalyst for the \ntransition not only in the city but also across the \ncountry. On the other hand, the interviewee from \nGabrovo highlights the positive experience and \nimportance of the 'bottom-up' approach and the city's \nparticipation in policymaking at the national level. \nRepresentatives and experts of the municipality of \nGabrovo are actively involved in national policymaking \nthrough various working groups. \n\nThe interviewees suggested several actions and \npolicy objectives of national/state governments that \ncontribute to cities' environmental and sustainability \nachievements. Renewable energy and Portugal's energy \nefficiency policy play a crucial role in Lisbon's energyefficiency transition. The country has made large \ninvestments in renewable energy sources (in particular \nwind turbines) which have helped Lisbon to achieve a \nsignificant reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. \nIn another example, the Estonian government is \nrunning an initiative to develop a 3D model (digital \ntwin) of the whole country, including buildings, \ninfrastructure, structures included below the ground, \nand even green infrastructure. A digital twin of a test \narea in Tallinn is already available. This model could \n\nhelp planners, developers, and state and municipal \nofficials to make more informed decisions, supporting \nthe pursuit of environmental objectives in Tallinn as \nwell as across the whole country. Such solutions will \nbecome increasingly common in European cities, \nand the EU's Digital Europe programme will support \nthe deployment of digital twins in at least 15 cities to \nincrease cities' resilience and adaptation to climate \nchange (EC, 2020a). \n\nSome interviewees mentioned that the alignment \nof city-level environmental sustainability ambitions \nwith national regulations can be challenging. One \nreason they suggested for this could be that cities \n(especially larger capitals) are sometimes ahead \nof national governments in taking action towards \nenvironmental sustainability and can help enhance \nambition nationally as well as abroad. The interviewee \nfrom Lisbon felt that, at the end of the last decade, \nthe city was taking the lead as regards environmental \nsustainability efforts, even while the financial \ncrisis meant that these issues were temporarily \ndeprioritised at the national level. \n\nDue to high overall populations and population \ndensity, (larger) cities also have particular opportunities \nto deliver services (e.g. public transport, water, \nwaste management, telecommunication, etc.) in a \nmore sustainable, effective and efficient manner. \nInterviewees from Lisbon, Stockholm and Mikkeli \nsuggested this might be another reason why the \nambitions of city government are not always perfectly \nin tune with national laws. \n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n33Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nSub-national standards, regulations and taxes can harm \ncities' environmental efforts\n\nAlthough still seen as positive drivers overall by the \nsurvey respondents, sub-national laws, standards and \nregulations and sub-national taxes, subsidies or other \neconomic instruments are considered less relevant as \ndrivers, with some cities also identifying them as barriers. \nLisbon, Mikkeli and Stockholm have the authority to \ncollect sub-national taxes. Interviewees from these cities \nconsidered these taxes to be a driver and an important \nsource of funding for their cities' environmental initiatives. \nConversely, the interviewee from Tallinn suggested \nthat the inability of the city to collect tax because of \nnational legislation and the distribution of state powers \nmight hinder its ability to pursue some environmental \nobjectives. For example, Tallinn cannot collect emissions \ntax for vehicles, which probably adversely affects efforts \nto\treduce\tGHG\u00a0emissions.\n\n3.2.3 Local governance\n\nThe evidence gathered implies that factors related to \nlocal governance might be the most important when it \ncomes to achieving urban sustainability transitions. The \nsurvey results indicate that many of the factors related \nto local governance were considered as (either strongly \nor slightly) supporting sustainability transitions in cities \n(see Figure 3.3). Local government overall vision and \nstrategic plans play a crucial role in this process (almost \nall cities recognise it as strongly supporting), which \nwas further confirmed by the interview analysis. Other \nsupporting factors identified by nearly all the survey \nrespondents and often mentioned by the interviewees \nare level of civic engagement and public participation; \nindividual political leadership; measurable targets and \nmonitoring of policy objectives; and level of coordination \nand integration of environmental sustainability with \nother\u00a0sectors. \n\nFigure 3.3  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to local governance supported \nor inhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n3\n\n5\n\n5\n\n7\n\n11\n\n7\n\n10\n\n18\n\n14\n\n22\n\n8\n\n9\n\n12\n\n11\n\n11\n\n16\n\n14\n\n6\n\n11\n\n3\n\n9\n\n6\n\n7\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nElection cycles/term times\n\nTrade-offs of environmental sustainability with\n other objectives\n\nModels of public services delivery (public, private,\n public-private partnership)\n\nPlanning culture and practices\n\nLevel of coordination and integration of\n environmental sustainability\n\nImplementation of local governance innovations\n\nMeasurable targets and monitoring of policy\n objectives\n\nIndividual political leadership\n\nLevel of civic engagement and public participation\n\nLocal government overall vision and strategic plans\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n34 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nCities use various models of governance and \nservices\u00a0provision\n\nThe analysis indicates that the cities interviewed \nuse various governance models and approaches to \nachieve their environmental sustainability ambitions. \nThese include top-down, bottom-up and multi-level \napproaches. While most cities' environmental matters \nare governed locally (i.e. by municipalities and/or \nregions), in the city of Leuven, the environmental \nsustainability agenda is being delivered by a \nnon-governmental organisation (NGO), Leuven 2030. \nCities also use and look for new models of (public) \nservices provision (e.g. public, private, private-public \npartnerships and cooperatives) in order to deliver \nthese in more a sustainable manner. Examples \nof services they provide include public transport, \nwater management and supply, waste management, \nmanagement of green and blue spaces, heating, \nelectricity supply, etc. For example, Tallinn is looking \ninto options for community-based energy production. \nLocal governments also explore and provide new \nmodels of financing for community and other projects \n(e.g. participatory budgeting in Lisbon and Tallinn).\n\nSustainability achievements are built on cities' clear \nvisions, strategic thinking and planning \n\nThe interviews suggest that local government overall \nvision and strategic plans are important in achieving \nsustainability transitions in cities. All cities list several \nstrategic plans (e.g. visions, roadmaps, action plans, \netc.) setting out their vision, objectives and actions to \nmake progress towards environmental sustainability. \nThe documents mainly address topics and set \nobjectives related to carbon emissions; energy (green, \nrenewable, efficiency, provision); climate (change, \nmitigation, adaptation, resilience); economy (green, \ncircular, shared); transport (green, multimodal, public, \nplanning of transport infrastructure); water (provision, \ncirculation, quality); green infrastructure; as well as \nnatural disasters (e.g. floods, heatwaves); housing \n(challenges, provisions, sustainable construction and \ndesign); and inclusion (social, intergenerational, digital). \n\nThe interviewees and survey respondents highlighted \nsome strategic documents that have been crucial for \nprogressing sustainability transition in their cities. \nExamples of these, which have either been published or \nare still being developed or updated, include:\n\n\u2022 Gabrovo has an overall sustainability vision 'Green \nGabrovo' and is working on Vision 2050, to be \npublished next year.\n\n\u2022 In Lisbon, the most important driver of \nenvironmental sustainability has been the \nLisbon Master Development Plan (2012-2022) \n(see\u00a0Box\u00a03.6).\n\n\u2022 In 2007, Stockholm adopted the 'Vision Stockholm \n2030', which outlines several strategies central \nto its implementation. The new City Plan (2010), \n'The Walkable City', seeks to improve urban \ngreen infrastructure and provides guidance on \nhow Stockholm will meet the objectives of its \nVision\u00a02030.\t\n\n\u2022 In Leuven, the sustainability trajectory is set by \nRoadmap 2025/2035/2050 (see Box 3.8).\n\n\u2022 In Tallinn, an important driver of sustainability \ntransition is the Sustainable Energy Action Plan \n2011-2021 and a new strategic plan to 2030, which \nwill also address environmental issues. \n\n\u2022 Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat has developed a 10-year \nenvironmental strategy known as Cornell\u00e0 Natura, \nwhich is focused on expanding green and blue \ninfrastructure, enhancing sustainable mobility and \nimproving environmental quality.\n\nMonitoring measurable targets helps cities to better \nplan for the future\n\nThe interviewees from Stockholm and Leuven \nstressed the importance of measurable targets \nand monitoring of policy objectives to measure \na city's performance towards environmental \nsustainability and identify areas and sectors \n(e.g. water, air, habitats, green space, climate, \ntransport, energy provision, etc.) where actions \nfor improvement are most needed. This enables \nbetter planning for the future and the setting of \npriorities and objectives in city strategies, plans and \nprogrammes (e.g. development, energy efficiency, \nclimate, transport, etc.). Measurable evidence of \nimprovement (e.g. better air quality) is usually \n'more believable' and better understood by the \npublic and other stakeholders, which might give \nenvironmental initiatives the momentum needed \nto progress further. For example, in Stockholm, as \nwell as standard environmental parameters like \nair and water quality, the city also works closely \nwith a local university to measure the resilience of \nimplemented\tNBS\t(e.g.\u00a0green\troofs,\tsustainable\t\ndrainage systems (SuDS), etc.), looking at how these \npreform over a period of time. The interviewees also \nmentioned several challenges related to monitoring \n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n35Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nand indicators to measure performance towards \nsustainability transitions, notably scale (data are mainly \navailable at the national level), but also timeliness \n(i.e. data are often too old to be useful), accessibility \n(e.g. format and ease of accessing) and quality \n(e.g.\u00a0robustness,\treliability,\trelevance,\tcomparability,\t\nand compatibility) of data and information. These \nissues are discussed further in the section on data and \ninformation\t(Section\t3.6\tData\tand\u00a0information).\n\nCities call for political and community leaders \nto drive the systemic changes needed to achieve \nsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\nMost interviewees also stressed the importance of \nindividual political as well as community leadership for \nthe implementation of environmental sustainability \nvisions, programmes, plans, policies and actions. \nFor example, the most important catalyst for Lisbon \nin terms of sustainability transition was the victory \nof the Socialist Party in 2007 and their 'green \nplan', which set out very clear environmental and \nsustainability objectives. The former mayor who had \nput environmental issues at the heart of the city's \ndevelopment agenda, which also brought obvious \neconomic and social benefits, was re-elected twice and \nis now prime minister of Portugal. The interviewee \nsaid that the former mayor's leadership was important \nin terms of investments in projects that brought \nenvironmental benefits (e.g. sustainable transport, \nrenewable energy, etc.). \n\nAn interviewee from Leuven said that activating many \nlocal leaders who will take ownership of sustainability \nactions and initiatives is essential not only for cities but \nalso for societies to make the more radical, systemic \nchanges that are needed to achieve sustainability \ntransitions. To address this, the NGO Leuven 2030 is \nlooking for a new governance model. Ideally, the model \nwould encourage and support community leadership \nin a way that gives the leaders enough autonomy while, \nat the same time, keeps them connected and close \nenough to 'core' governance. However, based on the \nexperience of known governance models, freedom to \nact while simultaneously ensuring that everyone works \ntowards the same collective objective has proven quite \na challenge. Other cities mentioned noticing the trend \ntowards more organised community actions in their \ncities (e.g. Lisbon, Gabrovo, Tallinn). \n\nCities are looking for ways to better engage with people, \ncommunities and institutions\n\nThe evidence suggests that the level of civic engagement \nand public participation, as well as coordination \nand cooperation among governmental and other \ninstitutions (e.g. businesses, universities, NGOs) \nmake an important contribution to sustainability \ntransitions in cities. Interviewees from all cities talked \nabout different forms of public participation and \ninterinstitutional cooperation, including participatory \nbudgeting for community projects, regular meetings \nin the city's neighbourhoods and districts, running \n\nBox 3.6 Lisbon Municipal Master Plan\n\nThe current tiered spatial planning system in the Portuguese System of Territorial Management (Sistema Nacional de Gest\u00e3o \nTerritorial \u2014 SNGT) is hierarchical and based on the concept of a 'cascade of plans'. The plans/instruments at lower levels \nprovide more detail on the spatial planning decisions/options set out in the higher-level plans. The municipal tier of the \nSNGT comprises Municipal Master Plans developed for all 308 municipalities in Portugal. They define land use (including \nlocation) and lay out a general municipal spatial development strategy (Serra et al., 2011). \n\nThe overall objective of the Lisbon Municipal Master Plan (2012-2022) is to foster the city's green transition by implementing \ngreen infrastructure (GI) and NBS to mitigate the impacts of economic and demographic challenges in Lisbon. The key \nchallenges the city has dealt with in the last decade include air pollution; reduced quality of life; uncontrolled urbanisation; \nheat-island effects; floods; lack of green space; and population decline. \n\nBuilding on the multiple (co)benefits of GI and NBS, the main sustainability objectives of the plan are: \n\n\u2022 implementation of GI (i.e. green corridors, street trees, green spaces and allotments) to achieve connectivity of green \nspaces for recreation, biodiversity and protection of natural and cultural landscapes;\n\n\u2022 rehabilitation of green spaces, buildings and city districts to achieve city regeneration and reverse depopulation; and\n\n\u2022 increasing green areas to tackle flooding and climate change.\n\nSince its realisation, the plan has become a flagship example of good urban spatial planning practice, demonstrating that \neven during a financial crisis a city can improve its residents' well-being by implementing relatively cheap, small-scale and \nfocused GI and NBS measures.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n36 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nprojects and events that bring together governments, \npublic, NGOs and businesses (e.g. ETI Climate-KIC in \nLeuven), and online platforms supporting citizens' \nengagement in decision-making and other processes. \nAs suggested by most, citizens' demands are an \nimportant driver of environmental actions in cities, \nwhich also encourages coordination and cooperation \nfrom different stakeholders. Interviewees from Lisbon \nand Leuven highlighted the importance of clear and \nsimple public communication for better buy-in on \nenvironmental policies, initiatives and actions by \nresidents, communities, businesses and development \nsectors (e.g. housing, transport, water, waste). This is \nfurther explained in Section 3.6 Data and information. \n\nElection cycles and results can either strongly support or \nhinder cities' sustainability transitions \n\nThe survey results suggest that the least supporting \nfactors related to local governance include election \ncycle/term times; planning culture and practices; and \ntrade-offs of environmental sustainability with other \nobjectives. Election cycles/term times were also identified \nby more than a third of the survey respondents as \nnot relevant to sustainability transitions in their city. \nHowever, according to the interview results, it seems \nthat for some cities, election cycles and the continuity \nof local government and administration (i.e. civil \nservants) are important factors that can either support \nor hinder their sustainability transitions. \n\nAs explained by the interviewee from Lisbon, winning \nseveral consecutive elections (four to date) has enabled \nthe local government to implement long-term projects \n\nand action based on the Lisbon Municipal Master Plan. \nSimilarly, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat has been governed \nby the same party for over a decade, which was also \nmentioned as a positive driver. The interviewee from \nLeuven suggested that local election term times are \ncrucial. At the moment, the Leuven government \nrecognises the importance of and is strongly in favour of \nurban environmental sustainability. However, it is very \nimportant that by the end of its mandate the running \nsustainability projects and initiatives it supports deliver \nresults. This is necessary to ensure political continuity \nas political disruption can be damaging and can slow \ndown the process of sustainability transitions in the city. \nIn Gabrovo, they emphasised the continuity of staff as \nimportant for carrying out long-term environmental \nambitions, although the political leaders might change \nquite\u00a0frequently.\t\n\nPlanning culture and practices were also mentioned \nby the interviewees as potential barriers to \nenvironmental sustainability. Past urban \ndevelopment patterns and doctrines made to \nsupport the lifestyle of people with different \nneeds and values to those we have today \n(e.g.\u00a0car-dependent\tsub-urban\tneighbourhoods\t\ndeveloped in the 1950s) either still dominate in \nsome cases or at least remain a significant part of \nexisting urban structures, which can be a barrier \nto sustainability changes. Although cities are \nmaking impressive efforts, transforming outlived \nurban settlement doctrines is a slow process, \nstrongly interwoven with the political, cultural \nand behavioural transformation of cities and \ntheir\u00a0residents.\t\n\nBox 3.7 How COVID-19 may be impacting governance drivers and barriers \n\nCity networks (e.g. Eurocities, Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, UGCL \u2014 United Cities and Local Governments) \nmay become even more important in shaping governance in the future as they play a vital role in supporting cities to deal \nwith the challenges of the pandemic by cooperating and sharing valuable experience and knowledge.\n\nWith the emergence of COVID-19, European cities require even stronger cooperation with the EU as they want to be actively \ninvolved in the EU's post-pandemic recovery. In a joint declaration to the European Commission, mayors connected through \nthe Eurocities network proposed more significant involvement by city governments in EU recovery programmes and \ndemanded direct access to European funding (Eurocities, 2020).\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to collect taxes and related financial autonomy might be of even greater \nimportance for cities, especially in light of taking actions to foster environmental sustainability transitions. Due to changed \npriorities in national spending (e.g. the focus on health) and other long-lasting economic and social consequences of the \npandemic, cities and municipalities are likely to endure further budget cuts. This could increase their financial dependence \non national and other resources (e.g. EU financial support) and could possibly lead to a shift in priorities as regards their \nactions and political agendas, which may not be in favour of environmental sustainability transitions.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n37Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n3.3 Knowledge \n\nCities across Europe are seeking to harness the \npower of knowledge to develop new visions of how \nsustainable urbanisation can and should look. The \ncomplexity and heterogeneity of urban systems \nmeans that identifying and implementing the most \nimpactful policies and strategies for a particular urban \ncontext remains a challenge. The production and \ndissemination of knowledge are therefore key drivers \nof evidence-based policymaking for sustainability. \n\nFor the purposes of this report, knowledge is \nunderstood to mean the key insights, skills and \nexpertise related to urban environmental sustainability \nprocesses, their management and options for action \nheld by individuals within a group or among groups (2). \n\nKnowledge can be shared between networks of \nactors directly involved in the creation, diffusion and \nuse of scientific, technological and other forms of \nknowledge, as well as those organisations responsible \nfor the coordination and support of these processes. \nThe importance of knowledge as a positive driver of \nchange was confirmed in the survey, with almost all \nknowledge-related factors being seen as very positive \nin terms of their impact on sustainability transitions. \nNetworks of cities and peer-to-peer learning, research \nand innovation, and levels of awareness of environmental \nsustainability stand out as being the factors selected \nby most survey respondents as having 'strongly \nsupported' their sustainability transitions (Figure 3.4). \n\nFigure 3.4  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to knowledge supported or \ninhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n11\n\n9\n\n13\n\n14\n\n11\n\n14\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n10\n\n14\n\n12\n\n5\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCommunication (different levels of government)\n\nKnowledge management and dissemination\n\nSkills of local workforce\n\nCommunication (within local government)\n\nLevel of shared understanding of sustainability\n issues  in local government\n\nEducation system\n\nLevel of awareness of environmental sustainability\n\nResearch and innovation\n\nSkills in local government\n\nNetworks of cities and peer-to-peer learning\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\n(2) This definition draws on the EEA MDIAK framework https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/europes-environment-aoa/chapter1.xhtml\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/europes-environment-aoa/chapter1.xhtml\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n38 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nThe knowledge factors that emerged as particularly \nimportant can be broadly differentiated as those that \nfacilitate knowledge production and those that facilitate \nknowledge dissemination.\n\nKnowledge production: innovation is critical to \nidentifying local solutions\n\nResearch and innovation emerged as among the most \nimportant positive drivers in the survey and were \nalso repeatedly highlighted as essential by the cities \ninterviewed. Several mentioned the importance of \nhaving a culture of innovation that has accelerated \ntheir sustainability transitions (see Section 3.4). The \nimportance of an innovation-led economy that is \nsupported by the right education, industry promotion \nand infrastructure development was highlighted \nby Gabrovo, Leuven, Stockholm and Tallinn. Having \na culture of entrepreneurialism clearly facilitates \nproblem-solving around complex sustainability issues \nand can help to reframe environmental challenges as \nopportunities. Many of the cities reported that thinking \nof the urban environment as a perfect test bed to \nexplore the viability of new solutions and technologies \nand to experiment with different ideas and approaches \nhad driven their sustainability transitions (Leuven, \nLisbon, Stockholm, Tallinn). \n\nCities pointed out that both local and international \nresearch collaborations had played an important role \nin ensuring that they were able to respond effectively \nto a range of environmental challenges. The EU was \nseen as an important broker of international research \npartnerships, for example by introducing Lisbon to the \nFraunhofer Institute in Germany, which is now helping \nthe city to review and adjust its environmental targets, \nor by connecting cities via EIT Climate-KIC, Europe's \n\nleading climate innovation initiative (Leuven, Lisbon). \nSuch partnerships were seen as a way of learning from \neach other and progressing more quickly towards \nshared environmental objectives. \n\nIncluding a diverse range of stakeholders improves \nknowledge production\n\nAll cities interviewed mentioned that collaborating \nwith the private sector, universities and civil society is \nimportant, allowing them to draw on a diverse range \nof knowledge sources to find innovative solutions. This \nwas considered essential in terms of early buy-in from \nall sectors of society and for ensuring that some of \nthe more radical or controversial policy changes were \nco-created with those most impacted by them. There \nwas an acknowledgement that the complex challenges \nfacing cities as regards sustainability transitions \nrequire new ways of working with stakeholders and \nthat traditional 'top-down' knowledge production \nneeds to be complemented by more 'bottom-up' \napproaches (see Box 3.8). Solutions can often come \nfrom unexpected places and local initiatives can \nprovide the inspiration for city-wide changes. \n\nThis also includes encouraging healthy competition \namong companies to improve their own sustainability \nbehaviour, which can act as an important complement \nto governmental efforts. Creating an environment \nwhere the private sector is working closely with \nthe city was generally seen as a vital way for \nmunicipalities to accelerate certain policy initiatives. \nFor example, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat highlighted \na recent collaboration with a local shopping mall \noperator to establish a park-and-ride scheme, while in \nLisbon, companies are being encouraged to remove \nparking\u00a0spaces.\t\n\nBox 3.8 Leuven's Carbon Neutral Roadmap driving collaborative innovation\n\nTo accelerate progress towards carbon neutrality, Leuven recently launched a new roadmap that was designed and is being \nimplemented by a broad coalition of public, private and third-sector stakeholders. The roadmap comprises 13 programmes \nand more than 500 individual projects, covering everything from buildings to energy to mobility to sustainable consumption \nand climate adaptation (De Paep et al., 2019). Many of these objectives are linked to new research and pilot projects that \nbuild on the city's long history of knowledge production. \n\nShared agreement around the science across these different stakeholder groups is enabling technological as well as process \ninnovation across all sectors. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for all tiers of government, knowledge institutions, \nthe private sector and civil society ensure that the roadmap is seen as a truly collaborative project for generating new \nknowledge that will enable the city to transition towards carbon neutrality.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n39Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nKnowledge dissemination: sharing best practices with \nother cities accelerates change\n\nNetworks of cities and peer-to-peer learning were \nidentified as a supporting factor by every city, making \nthis the positive driver most universally agreed upon \nacross the entire survey. The interviews strongly \nconfirmed this, with all cities speaking at length about \nthe importance of sharing best practice and how \nparticipating in various city networks had benefited \ntheir sustainability transition. \n\nMany cities felt that it was useful to be connected to \ncities that share a similar context due to geographic \nproximity or shared governance structures, as well as \nto those facing very similar environmental challenges \nand risks. Such connections enable cities to work to \nidentify shared solutions (e.g. Lisbon linking up with \nother Mediterranean cities that face water-scarcity \nchallenges; Gabrovo connecting with other Bulgarian \ncities to advance energy-efficiency measures; and \nMikkeli exchanging lessons with other cities across the \nNordic region). Identifying the right stakeholder groups \nand partners to tackle specific challenges was also seen \nas important. \n\nNetworks are more about collaboration \nthan\u00a0competition\n\nJoining organisations such as the Covenant of Mayors \nor the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group can create \nthe push cities need to improve data collection and \nadvance towards specific environmental goals while \nproviding a clear benchmark that cities can use to \ncompare their progress. \n\nDespite this, they felt that the main benefit of \ncity networks was that they fostered a sense of \ncollaboration and shared learning rather than \ncompetition (see Box 3.9). Many cities mentioned \nhow useful it can be to exchange with like-minded \nindividuals and learn from each other's successes and \nfailures. A culture of openness and a willingness to \nshare experiences was seen as one of the most positive \naspects of these city networks. Being part of networks \nalso creates accountability and, as Leuven pointed \nout, feeling part of a bigger movement of all cities \nworking towards a shared goal can sometimes make \nall\u00a0the\u00a0difference.\t\n\nBox 3.9 The European Green Capital and Green Leaf Awards: powerful drivers of change\n\nThe EGCA and EGLA emerge as important drivers of environmental sustainability for the award winners and finalists. All of \nthe cities interviewed emphasised the central role these awards had played in accelerating their sustainability journey. \n\nThe benefits identified by cities can be grouped into three main driver categories:\n\n1. Benchmarking: The stringent requirements of the award's application push cities to take stock of their current \nenvironmental performance and identify gaps in their knowledge. They are encouraged to systematically assess \nwhat they are doing and how they could improve. Many cities reported that this was an important driver to tackle the \ngreatest environmental challenges with which they were struggling. \n\n2. Strategic thinking: The award's application promotes more strategic thinking around environmental sustainability and \nhow it is integrated into wider city visions, as well as how it links with other urban development challenges. \n\n3. Legitimacy and leadership: Winning the awards has major reputational benefits and is seen as providing greater \nlegitimacy, enabling cities to demonstrate to political leaders and the public that their environmental efforts are paying \noff. It also allows cities to take on greater leadership in different areas of environmental sustainability.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n40 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nSome of the networks, institutions, schemes or awards \nthat were mentioned by many of the cities as having \nbeen of particular importance when it comes to \npeer-to-peer learning and knowledge exchange include:\n\n\u2022 C40 Cities\n\n\u2022 Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy \n\n\u2022 Energy Cities\n\n\u2022 Eurocities\n\n\u2022 European Committee of the Regions (CoR)\n\n\u2022 Green Capital/Green Leaf Network\n\n\u2022 ICLEI \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability\n\n\u2022 URBACT \u2013 Driving Change for Better Cities\n\n\u2022 Urban Agenda for the EU\n\nOf course, this list is not exhaustive as many other \nmore local, regional as well as thematic networks play \nan equally important role in knowledge sharing. \n\nAs regards networking, quality is more important \nthan\u00a0quantity\n\nInterviewees acknowledged that it can sometimes \nbe a challenge to manage participation in the large \nnumber of networks that have proliferated in the urban \nsustainability space in recent years. To ensure these \npartnerships are managed effectively, Lisbon has set \nup a special department that deals exclusively with EU \ncollaborations and partnerships and makes sure they \nenhance the city's learning and knowledge exchange. \nNot all cities have this level of resourcing, so the \nimportance of prioritising participation in networks that \nadd the most value is key. \n\nThe smaller Green Leaf cities reported comparatively \nless engagement with big international and \npan-European city networks, but instead stressed the \nimportance of regional and national networks of cities \n(e.g. Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Gabrovo, Mikkeli). This may \nalso be due in part to language barriers, which mean \nit may be more productive to engage with local city \nnetworks and organisations. \n\nCities are using city networks in many different \nways. They are clearly not just seen as platforms \nthat enable the sharing of knowledge and best \npractice but are also recognised as a way to amplify \ntheir voice and political bargaining power and to \nadvocate common interests. In this context, the \nEuropean Commission emerges as an important \nbroker, and initiatives such as Climate-KIC were \nrepeatedly highlighted as important positive \ndrivers promoting greater collaboration and \nmulti-stakeholder solutions to urban sustainability \n(e.g.\u00a0Leuven,\u00a0Lisbon).\n\nLevel of awareness and lack of communication can \nundermine sustainability efforts\n\nMany cities highlighted how vital it is to raise the level \nof awareness of environmental sustainability, both \nin the general population but also among politicians \nand civil servants. While overall awareness of and \ninterest in environmental issues has been increasing \nacross all sectors of the population, knowledge gaps \nbetween stakeholders can still undermine progress \nsometimes. Developing targeted campaigns to ensure \nthat everyone has a shared knowledge base regarding \nthe main environmental challenges and what can be \ndone about them was seen as critical to overcoming \nthis barrier. \n\nCommunication (both within local government and \nbetween levels of government) was identified most \nfrequently in the survey as inhibiting sustainability \nefforts. The level of shared understanding of \nenvironmental sustainability issues in local \ngovernment, and knowledge management and \ndissemination were also identified as potential \nbarriers by some cities. This was very much echoed \nby the interviews where cities frequently highlighted \nthe importance of greater communication with \nother departments and other levels of government \n(e.g. Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Gabrovo, Lisbon, \nMikkeli). Having an integrated strategic vision for \nthe whole city that ensures that sustainability \nissues are not dealt with in a siloed way but instead \nbecome a shared responsibility was seen as a \ncrucial way of overcoming this barrier. Cornell\u00e0 \nde Llobregat also stressed how important close \ncollaboration between the planning department \nand the environment department has been to \nmainstreaming sustainability issues across all \ngovernment\u00a0departments.\t\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n41Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n3.4 Culture \n\nThe SOER 2020 highlights that social practices \nand lifestyles are inextricably connected to the \nsustainability challenges facing cities. Our current \nuse of resources and resulting pollution are tied in \ncomplex and historical ways to behaviours and ways \nof living. Culture is thus an essential component of \nsustainability transitions (EEA, 2019). It has a strong \nrole to play in supporting the process of change \nand adaptation necessary for sustainable urban \ndevelopment, as evidenced by the emphasis on \ncultural and natural heritage among the targets of the \nUN Sustainable Development Goal 11 on Sustainable \nCities and Communities (UN, 2015). The EU Urban \nAgenda partnership on culture and cultural heritage \nalso recognises culture as an important driver of more \nsustainable cities. A recent white paper emphasises \nthat by providing 'a context in which creative people \nfrom different backgrounds, lifestyles, knowledge and \ndisciplines can meet, culture and cultural heritage \nfulfil the preconditions for innovation towards a more \nsustainable future. As a store of collective memory, \ncultural heritage can also provide contemporary \nsocieties with answers from the past on how to \ntackle adversity and remain resilient, both in terms of \nconceptualisation of problems and of offering practical \nsolutions' (ICLEI and Eurocities, 2019). \n\nFor the purposes of this report, culture refers to the \nshared characteristics (e.g. language, religion, cuisine, \netc.), patterns of behaviour (e.g. social habits, etc.) and \nunderstanding/attitude towards an issue (e.g. urban \nenvironmental sustainability and willingness to adopt \nnew behaviour) of a particular group of people (in \nurban areas) that are learned through socialisation (3).\n\nAs the survey also highlighted (see Section 2.3), it is \nonly in recent years that sustainability has become \nsuch a pressing issue for cities, reflecting broader shifts \nin environmental awareness that began to emerge \nfollowing the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and \nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro and the development \nof the Local Agenda 21 (LA21) (4). Cities are increasingly \nconfronting the impacts of climate change and dealing \nwith systemic environmental and social challenges that \narise in urban agglomerations. \n\nWhile a growing number of urban citizens are \nconcerned about the state of the environment, firmly \nestablished cultural values and habits can often lead to \ncontradictions between these new-found aspirations \nand lived realities. Thus, transitions to sustainability \nrequire cultural shifts in behaviour. \n\nThis requirement can generate anxieties and suspicion \nwithin local communities, for example, when new living \nand transport arrangements drastically change how \n\n(3) This definition draws from the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, available at: http://carla.umn.edu/culture/definitions.html\n(4) Local Agenda 21 is conceptualised in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21, which was adopted by 178 governments at the 1992 Rio Conference. Local \n\nAgenda 21 (LA21) is a voluntary process of local community consultation with the aim of creating local policies and programmes that work \ntowards achieving sustainable development. LA21 encompasses awareness-raising, capacity-building, community participation and the \nformation of partnerships.\n\nBox 3.10 How COVID-19 may be impacting knowledge drivers and barriers \n\nIn light of the coronavirus crisis, many of the city networks mentioned above have played a vital role in supporting information \nsharing between cities, helping them to identify policies that have worked well in other cities and learning from each other's \nmistakes. Initiatives such as the 'Cities for Global Health' Initiative led by UCLG, Metropolis and UN-Habitat also became \nimportant in this context, providing a safe space for cities to talk about the many challenges created by the pandemic. \n\nA number of the existing city networks have developed new initiatives specifically focused on the recovery from coronavirus. \nFor example, the C40 Global Mayors COVID-19 Recovery Task Force, has published an 'Agenda for a Green and Just \nRecovery', outlining key steps to delivering an equitable and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe, \ncities want to play an active role in the post-pandemic recovery, as is reflected, for example, in Eurocities' joint declaration \n'EU recovery powered by cities' (Eurocities, 2020). \n\nThe coronavirus crisis is putting greater emphasis on the importance of good knowledge management and dissemination. \nMore attention is being given to how 'scientific' data is or should be presented to wider audiences. In this sense, COVID-19 \nmight be an opportunity for cities and other governments to learn how to communicate relevant information to the public \nand foster positive behavioural (but also institutional, legislative, etc.) change in relation to other urgent systemic challenges \nsuch as climate change and other environmental issues.\n\nhttp://carla.umn.edu/culture/definitions.html\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n42 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\npeople experience urban life. Public engagement is a key \nmechanism for bridging the gap between the community \nand sustainability issues. Through the involvement of local \ncommunities, complaints can be raised, doubts put to rest \nand attitudes even changed. Having local communities \non-board becomes even more significant for sustainability \ntransitions when we consider the power that people hold \nto campaign and put pressure on authorities to do more. \nIn the light of recent global environmental movements, \nthis fact \u2014 of local communities enabling sustainability \ntransitions \u2014 has never been clearer.\n\nEmpowering and educating civil society creates feedback \nloops that push municipalities into action \n\nThe empowerment and training of civil society has \nbeen identified as one of the primary drivers for action \non adaptation in the face of climate change (Bulkeley \net al., 2009). The power of the public to further urban \nsustainability transitions was echoed in the survey results \nand the interviews conducted with cities. According \nto the results, the main cultural factors that enable \nurban sustainability transitions are values and attitudes \nto environmental sustainability by the general public, \nwillingness by local government to adopt new behaviours and \npractices, and the level of public engagement (Figure 3.5). \n\nIn\tthe\u00a0interviews\twith\tcities,\tdiscussion\tlargely\tfocused\ton\t\nvalues and attitudes to environmental sustainability by the \ngeneral public, and the level of public engagement.\n\nEngaging the public is essential to co-create \nsustainable\u00a0cities \n\nThe interviews revealed that public engagement \nwas a powerful driver of sustainability transitions. \nParticipatory processes that engage the public can raise \nenvironmental awareness and encourage citizens to \nrethink their behaviours and make changes to their \nconsumption patterns to reduce negative environmental \nimpacts \u2014 for example, by switching to more \nsustainable transport options, reducing single-use plastic \nor making more environmentally friendly food choices. \n\nAll cities expressed commitment to working with \nand listening to stakeholders in the community. \nFor\u00a0instance,\tMikkeli\tand\tLeuven\trecognised\tthe\tneed\t\nto harness the power of individual actions to co-create \na sustainable city. Recognising the importance of \ninvolving the public, the cities interviewed expressed \na willingness to adopt participatory mechanisms and \nprocesses to ensure the public's voice was heard and \ncaptured (see also Section 3.3).\n\nFigure 3.5  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to culture supported or \ninhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n8\n\n3\n\n9\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n11\n\n8\n\n5\n\n12\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n15\n\n9\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nLevel of sensitivity of local government to local\n culture (e.g. traditions, diversity, inclusiveness,\n\n heritage, religion)\n\nSocial and economic power dynamics\n\nWillingness by the general public to adopt new\n behaviours and practices\n\nFraming of environmental sustainability\n in public discourse\n\nValues and attitudes to environmental sustainability\n within local government\n\nLevel of public engagement\n\nWillingness by local government to adopt new\n behaviours and practices\n\nValues and attitudes to environmental sustainability\n by the general public\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n43Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nEducated and empowered citizens can drive action \non\u00a0sustainability\n\nIn addition, and perhaps most importantly, raising \nenvironmental awareness in the community means \nthat the public becomes empowered to make demands \non the authorities. Educating and empowering the \npublic is crucial because it creates a positive feedback \nloop, which enables sustainability transitions. \nAwareness-raising campaigns and activities educate \nlocal people and enhance their understanding of the \nkey sustainability issues. This heightens common \nawareness of environmental issues and, in turn, \nencourages local people to become more actively \ninvolved in putting pressure on municipalities to \nachieve their sustainability goals. \n\nThe initial difficulties involved in reaching out to get \nlocal people involved were noted in interviews. Cities \nthat have successfully built and sustained a network \nof relations within their local communities praised \nthis positive influence on sustainability transitions, \neven when it put pressure on themselves to deliver \n(see Box 3.11). This relates to the factor, willingness \nby local government to adopt new behaviours and \npractices, illustrating how local government attempts \nto integrate participatory mechanisms into their \ndecision-making\u00a0processes.\t\n\nYounger generations are more flexible when it comes \nto\u00a0adopting new behaviours\n\nBroader cultural transitions are taking place across \ncities, with younger generations in particular forging \ntheir own understanding of what it means to live \nwell within the limits of our planet. A generational \ndivide in cultural attitudes was referred to by several \ninterviewees. In this sense, younger people are \ngenerally considered more open-minded to the \nenvironmental sustainability agenda and more able to \nadopt greater flexibility in relation to the introduction \nof new technologies and initiatives that further \nsustainability transitions (see Box 3.12). \n\nBox 3.11 Gabrovo: 'The more we do, the more people  \n expect'\n\nParticipatory information campaigns across Gabrovo have \nfacilitated the introduction of a retrofitting programme \nfor multi-occupancy buildings. Gabrovo is a partner in the \nNational Programme for Energy Efficiency of Multi-Family \nHousing, which aims to reduce energy consumption \nby\t40\u00a0%\tby\timplementing\tenergy-efficiency\tmeasures\t\n(Gabrovo Municipality, 2016).\n\nDespite initial suspicion from residents, the municipality \nfound that the information campaign not only helped \naddress residents' concerns but also opened up a debate \non the topic of sustainability more generally. It provided \na space for the process of retrofitting to be discussed and \nfor residents to understand the wider benefits to them, \ntheir families and the environment. These participatory \ninitiatives raised environmental awareness and moulded \npublic opinion on issues of sustainability. The more \ngovernment officials in Gabrovo enacted sustainable \npolicies and plans, the more people became engaged. \nToday, citizens are increasingly making demands on the \nauthorities for further sustainability actions.\n\nBox 3.12 Beyond the car \u2014 a major cultural shift is  \n taking place in Lisbon\n\nThe end of car-centricity in Lisbon requires not just new \ninfrastructural investments but, importantly, cultural \nshifts in social habits and lifestyles, too. Following decades \nof car-centric planning, Lisbon is trying to reduce car \nuse and create a pedestrian and cyclist-friendly city. \nSteps that have been taken include fewer parking spaces \nand investments in active travel and public transport, \nincluding shared mobility options.  Over the last 2 years, \nthe\tLisbon\tPlaza\tProgramme\thas\trenovated\u00a021\tsquares\t\nand Pavimentar 2020 is restoring over 100 streets (Lisbon \nMunicipality, 2019). \n\nCultural shifts amenable to this transition are already \noccurring within younger generations who value highdensity urban living and the car-free accessibility it \nprovides. Younger generations are increasingly rejecting \ntraditional cultural values centred on car ownership \nand larger suburban houses, cultivating an openness to \nchange that is accelerating the sustainability transition \nand enabling a more radical rethink of what quality of life \nmeans.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n44 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nIn Mikkeli, for example, traditional values around \nownership are fading away, with younger people \nincreasingly recognising the value of the sharing \neconomy. Having a vibrant young population may make \nit easier for cities to enact sustainability transitions \nthrough radical policies that reshape lifestyles and \ndemand adherence to new ways of living and getting \naround the city. Despite this demographic divide being \ngenerally acknowledged across all cities, Stockholm felt \nthat attitudes were improving across all age groups \nand that greater education and awareness-raising \ncampaigns could help overcome entrenched \nbehavioural patterns or prejudices. \n\nThis highlights an important dimension of the factor, \nvalues and attitudes to environmental sustainability \nby the general public, by explicitly showing that the \ngeneral public is a diverse rather than a homogenous \ngroup. Despite generational differences in opinions \non sustainability that were noted in interviews, values \nand attitudes to environmental sustainability by the \ngeneral public is the top supporting factor identified in \nthe survey. This implies that sustainability transitions \ncan occur even when there are differences in values \nand attitudes among the public. In fact, by engaging \nwith people's doubts and suspicions, sustainability \ntransitions can be furthered. \n\nIt is clear that European citizens are increasingly voicing \ntheir frustration with the shortfalls in environment \nand climate governance (EEA, 2019) and placing \ndemands on authorities to take meaningful action. \nThis indicates that they are willing to both engage \nwith authorities and to adapt to the new social habits \nand behaviours that are required to further urban \nsustainability\u00a0transitions.\t\n\n3.5 Technology\n\nThe 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' is rapidly changing \nthe world around us (OECD, 2017; EEA, 2020). \nWidespread digitalisation of economies and societies \nis accelerating technological innovation worldwide, \nfundamentally changing production and consumption \nprocesses, and the way we live, work and interact \nwith each other. These changes are most evident \nin large global cities where the high density and \ndiversity of human settlements tend to lead to \naccelerated technological innovation (World Economic \nForum,\u00a02020).\t\n\nThe EU strongly recognises the importance of \ntechnological development for environmental \nsustainability. The European Green Deal states the \n'Commission will support work to unlock the full \nbenefits of the digital transformation to support \nthe ecological transition' (EC, 2019a). The aim of the \nrecently adopted new Industrial Strategy for Europe \n(EC, 2020b) is to support Europe's industry in leading \nthe twin transition towards climate neutrality of the \ncontinent by 2050 and global digital leadership.\n\nFor the purpose of this report, technology refers to \nthe different types of products and processes used to \nfacilitate or support changes in practices, processes \nand behaviours in different forms and areas of \ntechnological development, including education, \nconstruction, transportation, energy, information and \ncommunication, among others.\n\nBox 3.13 How COVID-19 may be impacting cultural drivers and barriers\n\nThe lockdown and related measures implemented by many European countries to stop the spread of COVID-19 have led to \na sudden decline in economic activities, including a drop in road transport in many cities. This has resulted in an associated \ndrop in air and noise pollution, with many people reporting increased awareness of the connection between human activities \nand their impacts on the natural world (Rousseau and Deschacht, 2020). \n\nIt remains to be seen whether this new awareness will lead to long-term changes in culture and behaviour. However, the \nclear data and evidence provided by the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service about the immediate improvements in \nair quality are likely to pave the way for emission reduction objectives that may have previously been seen as too ambitious \nor even counterproductive. Combined with other efforts, for example, through the European Green Deal initiative, this could \nlead to considerable changes towards greater environmental sustainability (Neill, 2020).\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n45Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nFigure 3.6  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to technology supported or \ninhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\nTechnological developments can support sustainability \ntransitions in cities \n\nAccording to the survey results, all factors related \nto technology are considered as mainly supporting \nsustainability transitions by a significant majority of \ncities (at least half of the respondents) (see Figure 3.6). \nTechnologies for environmental monitoring (e.g. air quality \nmonitors) and low-carbon technologies (e.g. electric vehicles, \nsolar photovoltaic) are recognised as supporting by \nalmost all cities (about half of the respondents consider \nthese factors strongly supporting). While considered as \nmainly supporting (by at least half of the respondents), \nbig data analytics and information communication \ntechnologies (ICT) were also seen as either slightly \ninhibiting sustainability transitions or as not relevant \n(neither supporting nor inhibiting by a fairly high number \nof respondents). This may be because some cities may \nnot be making use of big data or because there is a lack \nof government capacity to integrate big data analytics \nand other forms of ICT into existing decision-making \nprocesses. Another challenge might be the management \nof security and privacy requirements and concerns \nrelated to the use of these technologies. \n\nAll interviewees recognised that technological \ndevelopment in general terms supports and is \nimportant for sustainability transitions in their \ncities. A few interviewees mentioned that industrial \nor abandoned landfill sites on the city outskirts \nare being redeveloped into technological or green \neconomy centres, attracting start-ups, corporations, \nand innovative companies, which are often in the \nforefront of green innovations. For example, EcoSairila \nis a new centre for blue and green economy built on \nan abandoned landfill site on the outskirts of Mikkeli, \n\n1\n\n10\n\n12\n\n13\n\n12\n\n9\n\n12\n\n11\n\n8\n\n5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1Big data analytics\n\nInformation telecommunication technology (ICT)\n\nLow carbon technologies (electric vehicles,\n solar PV, smart meters etc.)\n\nTechnologies for environmental monitoring\n (e.g. air quality monitors)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\nattracting private eco-businesses developing new \nsolutions for future challenges (see Box 19).\n\nA creative atmosphere furthers the innovation \nmomentum in cities\n\nLeuven, Stockholm and Tallinn pointed out the \nimportance of a creative atmosphere for global tech \nand start-up hubs that foster the momentum for \ntechnological innovations in these cities. Since the \n1970s, Stockholm has been a global innovation leader \nin ICT, clean tech and life science technologies, while \nalso being one of the leading European cities in urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Thriving technological \ninnovations support Stockholm's sustainability efforts; \nthese include the smart city agenda, implementation of \nNBS, more sustainable modes of transport (e.g. electric \nvehicles, bikes) and energy-efficient housing. \n\nTallinn, which happens to share important historical \nties with Stockholm, is known for being the city with \nthe highest number of start-ups per person among EU \ncountries (Rooney, 2012). It is home to a number of \nhigh-tech companies, such as Skype and TransferWise, \nas well as the European Agency for the Operational \nManagement of Large-Scale IT systems in the Area of \nFreedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) and the NATO \nCooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The \ninterviewee also noted that new ICT, low-carbon and \nenergy-efficiency technologies are strongly supported \nby the Estonian government and are considered crucial \nfor Tallinn's successful sustainability transition. \n\nBy implementing and testing new innovations \n(e.g.\u00a0driverless\tbuses,\tsolar\troof\ttiles,\tvirtual\tpower\t\nstations), Tallinn is hoping to become an example for \n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n46 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nBox 3.14 Tallinn is banking on technological innovation to achieve its sustainability efforts\n\nTallinn has recently won the Netexplo Smart Cities 2020 Prize for digital transformation. The city provides over 80 fully digital \nservices. Initially 'smart' for the city meant using the latest technology, enabling access to Wi-Fi anywhere, and providing \nopened data access and high-quality e-services. Examples include a web application for public transport, a web map of \nTallinn, applying for licences and permits, application for traffic cameras, supporting entrepreneurial initiatives, etc. This has \nmoved on towards involving people in planning practices with the launch of the digital participation tool AvaLinn, enabling \nresidents to co-create and share feedback and ideas on the city's developments and spatial planning. The city recognises \nthat being 'smart' does not only mean providing digital services as it is no less important that the citizens are willing and able \nto use them. \n\nTallinn City Transport operates a public transport system including four trolleybus lines, 75 bus lines, train and ferry services. \nIn December 2019, it decided to replace all older diesel-powered buses with gas-powered models within the next 5 years. \nThe buses will use a mixture of compressed natural gas and compressed biomethane. Produced from biodegradable waste, \nbiomethane is a renewable natural gas. The trolleybuses run on renewable electricity, which is bought from WePower, an \nenergy-trading platform (WePower, 2020).\n\nIn\tEstonia,\tWePower\tenables\tbusinesses\tand\tindividuals\tto\tbuy\tgreen\tenergy\tdirectly\tfrom\tthe\tenergy\tgenerators\t(i.e.\u00a0solar\t\nand wind energy producers).

An \ninterviewee from Gabrovo suggested their advanced \ngeographic information system (GIS) is a key tool \nenabling spatial planners to adopt more sustainable \nsolutions\t(e.g.\tgreen\tinfrastructure,\ttransport,\u00a0housing).\t\n\nA few cities spoke about the importance of ICT \ntechnology in relation to the new forms of sustainable \nenergy production and distribution within cities. For \nexample, Lisbon is exploring opportunities to develop \nan energy platform and implement a city-wide smart \ngrid to reduce energy losses and make renewable \nenergy more affordable for residents. Furthermore, the \ncity is looking into the prospect of creating partnerships \nwith companies and other institutions, such as \nhospitals, schools and public buildings, which might \nhave the capacity to produce energy (e.g. via rooftop \nphotovoltaic power stations). \n\nBox 3.15 How COVID-19 may be impacting \ntechnological drivers and barriers\n\nTechnology, and in particular ICT, is proving to be crucial \nin easing the unprecedented economic and social \nimplications of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. by enabling \nonline education, working from home, and home delivery \nof essential and other goods). Technological development \nis generally seen as an important driver of sustainability \ntransitions, and important EU policy frameworks like \nthe European Green Deal are rightly placing significant \nemphasis on the digital agenda. However, it is important \nto keep in mind that technology is not a panacea and \nneeds to be carefully integrated into wider decisionmaking to mitigate unintended consequences. \n\nThere are still important inequities when it comes to digital \naccess and individuals with poor computer literacy or \nlimited access to high-speed internet or ICT devices may \nface barriers. As a growing number of public services, \nemployment opportunities, public discourse and social \nengagement are moving 'online', some social groups are at \nrisk of not only being excluded from spheres of community \nparticipation and involvement but also of having reduced \naccess to essential public services. This is an important \nreminder that we have to digitalise in a way that does not \nundermine social inclusion objectives.\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n47Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n3.6 Data and information \n\nAlthough data collection methods to measure the \nquality of environmental components like air, water \nor soil are scientifically sound and well developed, \nmeasuring cities' sustainability achievements can \nbe challenging. Arising from the potential of cities to \nreduce their impact on the environment is the need to \nestablish reliable data and information to identify these \nimpacts, their origins and to understand how they vary \nacross urban areas (Yetano Roche et al., 2014). \n\nFor the purpose of this report, data refers to raw, \nunorganised facts in various forms (e.g. big data, open \ndata, etc.) on relevant issues, whereas information \nis processed, organised and/or structured data so \nas to make it useful to develop knowledge on a \nsubject, issue, event or process relevant to achieving \nsustainability transition (5).\n\nCities are making efforts to improve data collection and \ncommunication practices\n\nThe survey results show that most factors related to \ndata and information are recognised by most cities as \n(either strongly or slightly) supporting sustainability \n\n(5) This definition draws from SMILE by Imperial College, Loughborough University and the University of Worcester in the UK.  \nAvailable at: https://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/smile/searching/whydoweneedinformation/whatisinformation\n\ntransitions (see Figure 3.7). Most interviewees \nmentioned the significance of data and information \nto monitor and present a city's progress, set relevant \nobjectives and prioritise areas and actions needed \nto achieve sustainability targets. The factors that \nstand out in the survey and were often discussed by \nthe interviewees are data and information collection \npractices and presentation and communication of data \nand information (both considered as supporting by \nmore than two thirds of respondents). \n\nA few cities mentioned that EGCA, EU Directives and \nmembership of EU networks highlighted the need for, \nas well as led to, significant improvements in data and \ninformation collection practices. For example, Stockholm \nstarted observing environmental indicators more \nclosely when the idea of the EGCA was founded in \n2006. The award was launched in 2008 with Stockholm \nbecoming the first city to win it in 2010. The EGCA \nguided and inspired Lisbon to develop and monitor \ndata across 12 environmental indicators, as required by \nthe award. This was further encouraged when Lisbon's \nSustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) was drafted in \n2010 as part of the city's commitments to the Covenant \nof Mayors. \n\nFigure 3.7  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to data and information \nsupported or inhibited the urban environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n5\n\n8\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n9\n\n14\n\n12\n\n12\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nData and information sharing practices (e.g. open data)\n\nScale of available data (e.g. national, regional, local)\n\nQuality (e.g. robustness, reliability, relevance,\n comparability, compatibility) of data and information\n\nAccessibility of data and information (e.g. formats and\n ease of accessing)\n\nPresentation and communication of data and information\n(e.g. analysis and linking data to policy outcomes)\n\nData and information collection practices (e.g. statistical\n services, qualitative and quantitative data collection)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\nhttps://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/smile/searching/whydoweneedinformation/whatisinformation\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n48 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nInterviewees also highlighted presentation and \ncommunication of data and information as important \nfor sustainability transitions, especially when it comes \nto communicating environmental and sustainability \nobjectives and achievements to its residents. Clear, \nsimple and specific green/sustainability objectives \n\u2014\u00a0the\tgreen\tprogramme\t(e.g.\tremoving\tcars\tfrom\tthe\t\ncity, improving air quality, using green infrastructure \nas the basis for spatial development, providing four \ntimes more solar power, etc.) \u2014 were considered \ncrucial for winning the 2009 local government \nelections in Lisbon against the 'business as usual' \nscenario advocated by the opponents. After winning \nthe election, the green programme became the new \ngovernment's action plan and the basis for the new \nLisbon Municipal Master Plan. Centred on green \ninfrastructure and the ethos of green spatial planning \nand development, this Plan became the flagship of \nLisbon's sustainability transition. Commitments to the \ngreen programme have won the local government \nfour consecutive elections to date. \n\nAn interviewee from Leuven emphasised the \nimportance of storytelling to facilitate sustainability \ntransition in its city (see Box 3.16). \n\nMeasuring sustainability can be challenging \n\nWhile considered as supporting by two thirds of the \nsurvey respondents, accessibility of data and information \nis also seen by a few cities as (either strongly or slightly) \ninhibiting sustainability transitions. Other inhibiting \nfactors identified by a few survey respondents included \nquality of data and information and scale of available data. \n\nInterviewees also reflected on these issues, indicating \nthat the most pressing concern is that relevant data \n\n(e.g. biodiversity, energy efficiency, emissions) is \nmostly generated at the national scale and is thus less \nuseful when measuring cities' sustainability efforts. \nTo\u00a0overcome\tthis\tchallenge,\tcities\tusually\tuse\twhatever\t\ndata are available from national statistics offices \nand often use various proxies to adjust the data to \ntheir needs. As highlighted by the interviewees, this \nmeans that the outcomes of the monitoring come \nwith some degree of uncertainty, which apart from \nmaking the efforts less believable sometimes instils \ndistrust and communication difficulties among various \ngroups of stakeholders (e.g. general public, opposing \nparty, businesses, etc.). Other challenges mentioned \ninclude timeliness (i.e. data are often too old to be \nuseful), accessibility (e.g. format and ease of accessing) \nand quality (e.g. robustness, reliability, relevance, \ncomparability, compatibility) of data and information.\n\nWhile trying to be as accurate as possible, to some \nextent cities also gather and produce data and \ninformation themselves. Most have their own \nmonitoring systems for water and air quality and often \nmeasure various indicators as part of specific projects. \nThe issue some cities raised in relation to projects is \nthat when specific project funding comes to an end, \nmonitoring of indicators often stops, too. \n\nTo enhance collection practices, quality, and \navailability of data and information, the cities \ninterviewed cooperate with national statistics offices \nto improve the understanding on what data are \nneeded at national, regional, municipal or even city \nlevel to monitor and support their sustainability \ntransitions. Some cities, such as Tallinn, are putting \ndata collection strategies in place. Working closely \nwith a national data agency, Statistics Estonia, Tallinn \nis developing a data pool for future analysis of its \n\nBox 3.16 Importance of storytelling to support Leuven's sustainability transition\n\nLeuven 2030, an NGO leading the city's urban sustainability transition, has been relying on professional guidance on how to \ntell its stories to build credibility and broaden its reach. Underestimating storytelling in the past, it has now recognised its \npower to communicate often complex issues and processes in a simple way to facilitate the city's sustainability transition.  \n\nThe NGO hired a professional storytelling agency, which resulted in the complete rebranding of Leuven 2030. Apart from \nchanging the logo, it stopped being the only messenger and moved from very scientific and informative to more emotional \ncommunication. It invited people with whom the residents of Leuven could identify (e.g. owners of small businesses, shops, \netc.), to tell their story, to explain how the 'greener' choices they had made had helped them and their businesses. In this \nway, the NGO has encouraged peer-to-peer inspiration, which has made a big difference to how people engage with the \ncity's environmental and sustainability initiatives.\n\nFor example, in 2016, it ran a campaign called 'LeuvenSwitch' to encourage people to switch to green energy. It was carried \nout by 21 ambassadors, among them a famous football player and singer, people with a different fan base who added their \nface to what turned out to be a very successful campaign. \n\nAs they say in Leuven 2030, 'not everything you do has to be about climate emissions and reductions. You don't have to use \nthose words to make a change.'\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n49Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nsustainability progress. Leuven has instigated a \nknowledge and monitoring sharing programme, in \nline with the Aarhus Convention's focus on providing \naccess to environmental information.\n\n3.7 Finance\n\nFinance, funding and budgetary allocations are some \nof the most significant ways governments can shape \nsustainability outcomes in cities. As highlighted in SOER \n2020, finance has a key role to play in either enabling or \nhindering sustainability transitions (EEA, 2019). \n\nFor the purposes of this report, finance refers to the \nprovision and management of public/government \nmoney and the process of acquiring funds through \ntraditional (e.g. taxes, public-private partnerships) and \ninnovative (e.g. micro-contributions/crowdfunding, \nland value capture) financial mechanisms to support \ngreen investments and the transition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Note that financing \ntypically refers to how upfront costs of building \ninfrastructure, etc. are met, while funding refers to \nhow it is paid for it over its life cycle (Institute for \nGovernance, 2018). \n\nBox 3.17 How COVID-19 may be impacting data and \ninformation drivers and barriers\n\nAs also reflected in the knowledge section of this report \n(Section 3.3), COVID-19 might further emphasise the \nimportance of clear presentation and communication of \ndata and information, in particular scientific data to the \npublic in order to encourage behavioural change. This \nmight be an opportunity for cities and other governments \nto improve public communication practices when \naddressing other systemic challenges, including climate \nand environmental issues.  \n\nCities were the 'hot spots' during the initial coronavirus \noutbreak in Europe and globally, and larger cities in \nparticular usually continue to have a higher concentration \nof cases compared to less urbanised areas. This might \nlead to better accessibility, quality and availability of \ndata and information at scales more relevant to cities \n(e.g. city region, district, municipality). Greater interest in \nwhat influences the health and well-being of city dwellers \n(e.g. lifestyle choices, habits, socio-economic conditions, \neducation, etc.) might also lead to better availability of \ndata that could potentially be relevant to an analysis of \nurban sustainability transitions.\n\nThe survey highlighted that most factors related to \nfinance listed in the questionnaire are considered as \n(either strongly or slightly) supporting by more than \ntwo thirds of respondents (Figure 3.8). \n\nFactors that stand out as being particularly supportive \ninclude level of own-source revenues, level of national/\nstate government public funding for environmental \nsustainability and access to multilateral funds such \nas EU funds. The factors considered a barrier by \nthe highest number of cities in the survey include \nlevel of fiscal decentralisation and level of funding for \npublic service operations and maintenance. The level \nof bilateral funding was largely considered as neither \nsupporting nor inhibiting. This is not surprising given \nthat few European cities receive any bilateral funding \nfrom individual donor countries but rely much more \non multilateral funding through EU institutions \n(e.g.\u00a0European\tStructural\tand\tInvestment\tFunds\tand\t\nfunding programmes such as Horizon 2020, LIFE, etc.). \n\nWealth matters \u2014 but it is not the only thing \ndriving\u00a0sustainability\n\nUrban sustainability transitions will require investments \nacross multiple sectors (e.g. transport systems, housing \nretrofits and electricity systems), many of which have to \nbe supported by new business and financing models. \nInvestments in green infrastructure will need to be \ncomplemented by increased spending on research and \ndevelopment and financial support for new processes \nand policies that can change behaviour. When looking \nat international sustainability indices, many seem to \nsuggest a correlation between wealth and sustainability. \nFor example, the Siemens Green City Index points out \nthat the best-ranked cities in its European Index have \none thing in common \u2014 they are all wealthy \u2014 with \nCopenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Vienna and Oslo \ntopping the list (Shields et al., 2009). The interviews \nconfirmed this to an extent, with some of the wealthier \ncities such as Stockholm and Leuven indicating that \nstrong economic growth had enabled a lot of the more \nexpensive investments the city has undertaken in recent \nyears and provided the momentum for them to push \ntheir green agenda further. On the other hand, Lisbon \nmade major progress in its sustainability transitions \nin the midst of the financial recession, demonstrating \nthat political will and vision is at least as important as a \nbig budget. High-impact initiatives and changes do not \nalways have to be expensive, and relatively low-cost \ninterventions, such public awareness campaigns or \nincreasing community engagement, can still make a \nmajor difference. \n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n50 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nInsufficient fiscal decentralisation continues to be \na\u00a0barrier\n\nSeveral cities highlighted that small municipal budgets \ncan be a challenge when it comes to implementing \nmore ambitious sustainability projects (e.g. Gabrovo, \nLisbon, Tallinn). Across the EU, there has been \na push towards greater fiscal decentralisation, \nincreasing the ability of local governments to collect \ntheir own revenues while also giving them greater \nautonomy when spending the funds they receive \nfrom national government (see Section 3.2). Despite \nthis, differences remain when it comes to the powers \nthat cities in different EU countries have over their \nspending\t(see\u00a0Box\t3.18).\tWhile\tin\tsome\tcountries,\t\nlocal governments receive a high share of tax revenue \nand have relatively high autonomy over how to spend \nit (e.g. Finland, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Spain, \nSweden)  in others, local tax revenue is a lot lower and \ncities have more limited decision-making power when \nit comes to spending (e.g. Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, \nIreland, Slovenia) (Alexandru et al., 2011). \n\nFigure 3.8  Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to finance supported or \ninhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?' \n\n1\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n3\n\n7\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n8\n\n11\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n6\n\n11\n\n12\n\n12\n\n18\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nLevel of bilateral funding (e.g. from donor countries)\n\nLevel of fiscal decentralisation\n\nLevel of funding for public service operations and\n maintenance (both private and public sources)\n\nLevel of private sector funding for environmental\n sustainability\n\nLevel of private investment in research and development\n\nLevel of public investment in research and development\n\nLevel of funding for infrastructure projects (both private\n and public sources)\n\nAccess to multilateral funds (e.g. European Regional\n Development Fund ; UN- Multilateral Fund)\n\nLevel of regional/local funding for environmental\n sustainability\n\nLevel of national/state government public funding for\n environmental sustainability\n\nLevel of own-source revenues (e.g. local taxes, fees,\n charges)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2019t know No answer\n\nAccess to multilateral funding through the \nEU\u00a0is\u00a0fundamental \n\nMany of the substantial investments required to \ndevelop more sustainable infrastructure exceed \nwhat cities can finance through their own budgets \nand will therefore rely on support from national and \nsupranational governments as well as public-private \npartnerships. Even for cities that have higher own-source \nrevenues than Gabrovo, the vitally important role of \nmultilateral funding, in particular diverse sources of \nEU funding, was repeatedly highlighted in this context. \nThe European Commission was seen as essential in \nfacilitating access to critical investments that support \nmore sustainable infrastructure and operations, with all \ncities highlighting how important this had been to their \nprogress. Support from the European Investment Bank \n(EIB) was mentioned as an important driver by Leuven \nand Lisbon. In both cities, the EIB played a crucial role \nin financing essential green investments, including into \nnew water infrastructure, transport, waste management \nand energy-efficient buildings.

In 2018, the city was \nrecognised by MEPs as a role model for funding it received via the EU Cohesion Fund to upgrade its water infrastructure. \n\nGiven that many of these funds are distributed on a competitive basis, the significant number of successful EU-funded \nprojects in Gabrovo are testament to the administration's hard work to ensure that the city can advance its sustainability \nagenda with the help of EU funding.\n\nLack of alignment with national government can \nundermine funding goals\n\nPolitical alignment between the national government \nand the city can ensure that national spending supports \nthe sustainability objectives. In Lisbon, support from \nthe national government for new transport projects is \nconsidered essential. The fact that the prime minister \nused to be the mayor of Lisbon makes it easier for \nthe central government to understand why certain \ninvestments should be prioritised. In Cornell\u00e0 de \nLlobregat, spending by the regional government is \nplaying a vital role in supporting new sustainability \nprojects in the city, including the flagship Cornell\u00e0 \nNatura project. There is a very strong consensus \nacross the key administrative levels when it comes to \npriority projects and a shared sense of urgency around \nenvironmental sustainability challenges (see also \nBox\u00a03.5).\t\n\nBy contrast, Tallinn mentioned that cooperation issues \nwith the national government have at times created \na serious barrier to progress. One clear example is \nthe national government's unwillingness to consider \nintroducing car taxes, which would support Tallinn's \n\nefforts to reduce car use and would also generate \ntax income that could then be invested in the public \ntransport system. The city has been trying to introduce \nits own tax on combustion engine vehicles, but \nthis has yet to prove successful because Estonian \nmunicipalities do not have powers to raise taxes locally. \nThe introduction of a tourist tax that could be used to \ncross-subsidise important sustainability projects has not \ncome to fruition for the same reason, leading to tensions \nbetween the municipality and the national government. \n\nPrivate-sector funding is essential and can lead to winwin outcomes\n\nWorking closely with the private sector to increase \ninvestment in sustainable infrastructure was \nmentioned by most of the cities as an important driver. \nThis includes developing public-private partnerships \nfor the delivery and operation of new wastewater \ntreatment, energy-efficiency measures and transport \nimprovements (e.g. Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Gabrovo \nand Lisbon). Collaboration with the private sector can \naccelerate progress towards core policy objectives \nwhile, at the same time, providing significant benefits \nfor local businesses (see Box 3.19). Gabrovo, Leuven, \n\nBox 3.19 Mikkeli aims to attract private investors with new blue green innovation centre\n\nIn an effort to attract private-sector investment while simultaneously driving innovation in the circular economy, Mikkeli is \nredeveloping an old landfill site and transforming it into EcoSairila \u2014 a new Centre for the Blue and Green Economy, which \nthe\tcity\thopes\twill\tact\tas\ta\tdevelopment\tplatform\tfor\tnew\tcircular\teconomy\tideas.\tTo\tdate,\tover\tEUR\u00a0100\tmillion\thave\tbeen\t\ninvested in the research and infrastructure of water technology, material cycles and renewable energy. A state-of-the-art \nwater-treatment plant with research and pilot facilities and a biorefinery producing biogas and organic nutrients are \nunder\u00a0construction.\t\n\nThe aim of EcoSairila is to bring together a diverse group of companies specialising in the circular economy, as well as \nresearch and development organisations studying new technologies and business models. The ecosystem of companies \nis boosted through the collaboration of the private and public sectors: EcoSairila is opening up the public infrastructure to \nwelcome private businesses to bring growth and strengthen the region (Miksei Mikkeli, 2019).\n\f\nUnderstanding\tthe\tfactors\tthat\tshape\turban\tenvironmental\tsustainability\u00a0transitions\n\n52 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nStockholm, Tallinn all highlighted the co-benefits for \ninnovative local businesses, which can take advantage \nof the new green economy that is emerging in \ntheir\u00a0cities.\t\n\nOne challenge referred to by Lisbon was that the \nquest for private-sector investment and the associated \njobs can create competition, which, at times, risks \nundermining certain sustainability objectives. For \ninstance, municipalities in the Lisbon metropolitan area \nare all vying to attract large companies, but if these \nlarge companies are then located in new business \nparks without an adequate transport infrastructure this \ncould perpetuate car dependency and urban sprawl. \n\nGreen public procurement allows cities to use their \npurchasing power for the common good\n\nMany cities mentioned the importance of improving \ntheir procurement processes and embracing green \nprocurement as a vital part of their sustainability \ntransitions. Gabrovo highlighted that green public \nprocurements provide additional economic and \necological added value to the process of public \nspending. Lisbon is becoming involved with the \nEuropean EcoProcura conference series to accelerate \n\nits own capacity for green procurement. Mikkeli \nmentioned the importance of EU procurement policy \nas an important way of accessing additional funding for \nsustainable transport initiatives. \n\nUnsustainable spending behaviour continues to \nundermine progress\n\nAlthough ensuring that both public and private \ninvestments support sustainability objectives in cities \nis essential, it is still not happening in a consistent way. \nAs the United Nations Environment Programme notes, \n'clearly, some capital is flowing to the new economy \nthat we need. But far more is continuing to support \nthe old economy' (UNEP, 2018). For example, Leuven \nsuggested\tthat\tit\tneeds\tto\tinvest\tabout\tEUR\u00a0350\tmillion\t\na year between now and 2050 to achieve carbon \nneutrality.\tAbout\t75\u00a0%\tof\tthat\tmoney\tis\talready\tthere\t\nand circulating in the local economy \u2014 but it needs \nto be spent in different ways to support sustainability \ntransitions rather than continuing to promote \nunsustainable consumption patterns (e.g. flying, \ndriving, meat consumption). Finding ways to promote \nmore environmentally sustainable consumer spending \nis clearly an important part of the wider efforts to fund \nurban\tsustainability\u00a0transitions.\n\nBox 3.20 How COVID-19 may be impacting finance drivers and barriers\n\nThe financial repercussions of the coronavirus crisis are being felt across all sectors of society in Europe, and across all levels \nof government, and are also affecting their environment and climate agendas. Local governments are at the forefront of this \nstruggle, with unexpected expenses to address the social and economic fallout exacerbated by a drastic collapse in revenues \n(e.g. due to reduced local taxes, fees and charges). While greater fiscal autonomy and own-source revenues are generally \nseen as desirable, during the pandemic, cities that rely heavily on municipal income sources for their budget may actually \nstruggle the most. \n\nCities will require commitments by EU and national governments to maintain or increase funding to address local \nshortfalls and enable cities to continue to deliver vital public services, while at the same time making progress towards \ntheir environmental targets. Without this support, there is a real risk that cities will not be able to advance important green \ninitiatives, which could have catastrophic consequences for Europe's wider sustainability transitions.\u00a0Fortunately,\tthere\tis\t\nclear evidence that just and green economic recovery measures (such as investing in energy-efficiency retrofits) can help \nmunicipal governments to maximise short-term benefits for employment, while catalysing wider transformations and \nsecuring\tthe\tlonger-term\tsocio-economic\u00a0rewards\tassociated\twith\tambitious\tclimate\taction\t(C40,\t2020).\t\n\nThe European Green Deal provides an important framework to guide how recovery funds should be spent, although it will \nstill be up to individual cities to identify opportunities that move them away from 'business as usual' spending decisions.\n\f\n53\n\nSummary of findings\n\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n4 Summary of findings\n\nLocal governments across Europe are proactively \nleading the way towards a more sustainable, resilient \nand just urban future. Based on the surveys and \ninterviews with individual city officials, this report \nhas provided some evidence about how progress \ntowards this goal might be accelerated by identifying \ncommon drivers of change that can either enable or \nhinder urban environmental sustainability transitions. \nA summary of the main findings from this analysis is \npresented below. \n\nOf course, cities differ enormously in the challenges \nthey face and the tools they have available to address \nthem. Sharing concrete examples of the many different \nexpressions of urban sustainability can help to inspire \ncities, irrespective of their context, and help them \ndevelop a transition pathway that is right for them. \nTo make this work more useful and robust, this first \npiece of research will need to be complemented with a \nmore in-depth analysis to better understand individual \nfactors and their interactions, both across and within \nindividual cities.\n\n4.1 About the cities that participated in \nthe research\n\nThe geographic spread of the 26 cities that responded \nto the survey broadly reflects the distribution of \nall 40 winners and finalists of the EGCA and EGLA. \nEastern cities are the least represented, followed by \nsouthern, northern and western cities. Most of the \nrepresentatives of cities who completed the survey \nwork in environment and climate change departments.\n\nInterviews were held with a range of cities, both in \nterms of their size and their geographic distribution. \nThe interviews covered two eastern European cities \n(Gabrovo and Tallinn), two southern European cities \n(Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat and Lisbon), two northern \nEuropean cities (Mikkeli and Stockholm) and one \nwestern European city (Leuven).\n\nThe cities face a wide range of environmental \nchallenges with those most commonly identified \nincluding severe storms and flooding, air pollution, \nstorm water management, decline of native species/\n\nnatural habitats and heatwaves. This was confirmed \nby interviews with cities where storms, flooding, air \npollution, water scarcity, heatwaves and the lack of \ngreen space were identified as major challenges. \n\nMost cities in the survey have been considering \nenvironmental sustainability objectives as an important \npart of their political agenda since the period between \n1992 (the Rio Conference) and 2000. This means they \nhave around 25 years of experience mainstreaming \nenvironmental sustainability into their policy-making \nprocesses and can be considered as having a fairly \nwell-established track record in this area. In the \ninterviews, some cities felt that sustainability has only \nreally emerged as a core aspect of their political agenda \nin the past 10 years or so (e.g. Tallinn), while some cities \nsaid that sustainability had been an important priority \nfor several decades (e.g. Stockholm).\n\nAccording to the survey, public opinion/awareness of \nsustainability issues was seen as the most significant \ntrigger driving greater action around environmental \nsustainability in cities. This was followed by changes in \npolitical leadership, a specific environmental crisis and \npressure from stakeholders. The interviews supported \nthis to a large extent, highlighting the importance of \npublic opinion, leadership change and pressure from \ndiverse stakeholders. \n\n4.2 Key drivers of and barriers to \nurban environmental sustainability \ntransitions\n\nThis section summarises the key drivers of and barriers \nto urban environmental transitions identified through \nthis research. A review of all the enabling factors \nidentified in this study highlights particular factors that \nstood out from the survey results and subsequent \ninterviews. While some factors certainly featured in \na general consensus from the cities participating in \nthis research regarding their importance, this did \nnot apply universally. Factors identified as extremely \nimportant to sustainability transitions by some cities \nwere highlighted either as a barrier or considered \nless relevant by other cities (e.g. sub-national taxes, \nsubsidies or other economic instruments; sub-national \n\f\nSummary of findings\n\n54 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nlaws, standards and regulations; social and economic \npower dynamics; and the framing of environmental \nsustainability in public discourse). This indicates \nthat what drives sustainability transitions, at least \nto some extent, varies across cities and there is no \n'one-size-fits-all' solution to achieving sustainability \ntransitions. Of course, the relatively small sample \nsize also makes it more difficult to discern very clear \npatterns and repeating the survey with a larger number \nof European cities might yield more definitive results \nabout the leading drivers and barriers. Nevertheless, \ndespite this heterogeneity of opinions, some important \nfindings in relation to the key drivers and barriers of \nurban sustainability transitions have emerged from this \nexploratory work. In future research, these should be \ninvestigated further to test their robustness in different \nurban contexts. \n\n4.2.1 Key drivers supporting environmental \nsustainability transitions in cities\n\nContextual drivers\n\n\u2022 The most significant contextual factors identified in \nthe survey as supporting sustainability transitions \nin cities are: existing infrastructure; air/water/\nsoil quality; city size; climatic conditions; and GDP \nper\u00a0capita.\t\n\n\u2022 Although the survey identified existing grey \ninfrastructure as the most important supporting \nfactor, interviews highlighted that it can also be \na barrier by creating path dependencies and \nbehavioural lock-in (e.g. car-centric road use, urban \nsprawl, outdated/energy-inefficient infrastructure). \nSince this is one of the more dynamic contextual \nfactors, it can be adapted to align with new \nsustainability objectives (e.g. removing parking to \nmake space for cycle lanes, retrofitting buildings). \n\n\u2022 Close proximity to natural assets and accessibility \nto green spaces and natural areas were identified in \nthe interviews as important contextual factors that \ncan encourage people to care about environmental \nsustainability, thus becoming important drivers for \nmore action. \n\nGovernance drivers\n\n\u2022 Among factors related to national and supranational \ngovernance, international treaties and EU laws, \nstandards and regulations stand out as the most \nstrongly supporting factors. Interviewees mentioned \nthe European Green Deal and emphasised the \nimportance of EU Directives such as the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD), the Energy Efficiency \n\nDirective (EED) and the Energy Performance \nof Buildings Directive (EPBD) for implementing \nenvironmental legislation and driving environmental \ntechnological innovations. These are followed \nby national laws, standards and regulations, \nand the distribution of state powers and level of \npolitical\u00a0decentralisation.\n\n\u2022 While all the factors related to local governance \nare considered as mainly supportive, local \ngovernments' overall vision and plans were seen \nas the most important local governance factor. The \nevidence gathered shows that local governance is \ncrucial in influencing sustainability transitions in \ncities. However, all levels of governance, including \nEuropean, national, and regional, play an important \nrole in this process. \n\n\u2022 Effective multi-level governance across sectors and \ngovernance scales, as well as better collaboration \nwith non-governmental stakeholders, such as civil \nsociety, the private sector and academia, were also \nhighlighted in the interviews as important drivers. \n\nKnowledge drivers\n\n\u2022 All factors related to knowledge were mainly seen \nto support sustainability transitions. The top factors \nidentified through the survey include: networks \nof cities and peer-to-peer learning (selected as \nsupporting by every city in the survey); research \nand innovation; and the level of awareness of \nenvironmental sustainability. \n\n\u2022 These findings were confirmed in interviews where \nthe role of city networks and the learning and \ninnovation this enables were emphasised as an \nimportant positive driver in all cities, with the EGCA \nand EGLA standing out as particularly important.\n\n\u2022 Research and innovation, particularly if carried \nout in a collaborative and inclusive way across \npublic, private and third sectors, and raising \nenvironmental sustainability awareness were also \nhighlighted\u00a0repeatedly.\t\n\nCultural drivers\n\n\u2022 Cultural factors seen as the most important in \nsupporting sustainability transitions include: \nthe general public's values and attitudes to \nenvironmental sustainability; willingness by local \ngovernment to adopt new behaviours and practices; \nthe level of public engagement; and values and \nattitudes to environmental sustainability within \nlocal\u00a0government.\t\n\f\nSummary of findings\n\n55Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n\u2022 The importance of engaging local citizens early \nand consistently in sustainability transitions was \nhighlighted in the interviews as the best way to \nchange values and attitudes to environmental \nsustainability and ensure that people feel included \nin the transition process. \n\nTechnological drivers\n\n\u2022 As indicated by the survey and interviews, \ntechnological development is generally seen as an \nimportant enabler of sustainability transitions in \ncities. Nevertheless, the increasing digitalisation of \neconomies and societies raises social inclusion and \nequity concerns as some social groups with poor \ncomputer literacy or limited access to ICT devices \n(e.g. elderly, low-income families) are at risk of not \nonly being excluded from spheres of community \nparticipation and involvement but also of \nexperiencing reduced access to vital public services.\n\n\u2022 While all the factors related to technology were \nseen as largely supporting sustainability transitions, \ntechnologies for environmental monitoring \n(e.g.\u00a0air-quality\tmonitors)\tand\tlow-carbon\t\ntechnologies (e.g. electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic) \nstand out as being the most supportive. \n\n\u2022 The interviews further confirmed that cities are \nimplementing and relying on ICT and big data \nanalytics, as well as developments in low-carbon \ntechnologies and environmental monitoring \ntechnologies, to further their green efforts in \nvarious sectors, including housing, transport, \nenergy, governance, water and waste management.\n\nData and information drivers\n\n\u2022 The survey highlighted that most factors related to \ndata and information are recognised as supporting \nsustainability transitions. Factors that stand out in \nthe survey and were also frequently mentioned by \ninterviewees are: data and information collection \npractices; and presentation and communication of \ndata and information (both considered as supporting \nby more than two thirds of respondents). \n\n\u2022 Most interviewees mentioned the significance \nof data and information to monitor and present \na city's progress, set relevant objectives and \nprioritise policies and actions needed to achieve \nsustainability\u00a0targets.\t\n\n\u2022 Several cities stated that they are working on \nenhancing their information collection and \ncommunication practices, and there is growing \n\nrecognition of the important role these factors play \nin successful sustainability transitions, helping cities \nwith evidence-based decision-making and ex-post \nanalysis of specific interventions, including policies. \n\nFinancial drivers\n\n\u2022 The main financial factors identified in the survey as \nsupporting sustainability transitions are: own-source \nrevenues (e.g. local taxes, fees); level of national/\nstate funding for environmental sustainability; and \naccess\tto\tmultilateral\tfunds\t(e.g.\u00a0European\tRegional\t\nDevelopment Fund). \n\n\u2022 The importance of multilateral funding, and in \nparticular EU funding, was seen as absolutely \nessential by all cities interviewed, providing support \nfor a wide range of sustainability investments from \nenergy efficiency to transport improvements and \nupgrades to water and sanitation infrastructure.\n\n\u2022 Green public procurement was also seen as an \nimportant driver, with the role of EU procurement \npolicies highlighted as particularly valuable in \nsupporting cities to improve their procurement \nprocesses and embracing green procurement as a \nvital part of their sustainability transitions.\n\n4.2.2 Key barriers to environmental sustainability \ntransitions in cities\n\nContextual barriers\n\n\u2022 The key barriers identified in the survey as hindering \ntransitions are: gentrification; demographics; \nexisting urban form; and structure of the economy. \n\n\u2022 The interviews highlighted that urbanisation and \npopulation pressures (e.g. population growth, urban \nsprawl, gentrification), especially in the context of \nthe climate crisis, intensify existing environmental \nchallenges and can make it harder to advance \ntowards greater environmental sustainability. \n\n\u2022 Demographics can be a barrier in different ways, \nwith growing populations adding more pressure to \nexisting services, but sparse populations making \ncertain services, such as public transport, more \nchallenging to deliver. An ageing population and \n'brain drain' caused by the migration of young \npeople were also seen as major challenges. \n\f\nSummary of findings\n\n56 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nGovernance barriers\n\n\u2022 Barriers were identified in relation to sub-national \nlaws, standards and regulations and, importantly, \nsub-national taxes, subsidies or other economic \ninstruments. Some cities have less legislative and \nfiscal autonomy, which might hinder their ability \nto pursue environmental ambitions. For example, \nthey may be unable to collect emissions tax which \nmight adversely affect efforts to decarbonise \nurban economies and encourage more sustainable \ntravel\u00a0patterns.\t\n\n\u2022 Factors related to local governance that significantly \nhinder transitions in a small selection of cities \ninclude: election cycle/term times and related \ncontinuity of local government and administration; \nplanning culture and practices; and trade-offs of \nenvironmental sustainability with other objectives.\n\nKnowledge barriers\n\n\u2022 The following factors were identified as barriers by \na small number of cities (suggesting that all such \nfactors were not sufficiently well developed/lacking \nin their city): level of awareness of environmental \nsustainability; level of shared understanding \nof sustainability issues in local government; \ncommunication within local government as well \nas between different levels of government; and \nknowledge management and dissemination.\n\n\u2022 The interviews further highlighted that a lack of \nshared understanding of sustainability priorities \nand insufficient communication across government \ndepartments can sometimes be an important \nbarrier when it comes to knowledge creation and \ndissemination. \n\nCultural barriers\n\n\u2022 Although this was also one of the main supporting \nfactors, the general public's willingness to adopt \nnew behaviours and practices emerged as the main \nbarrier from the factors tested via the survey.\n\n\u2022 This was supported by some of the interviews, \nwhich highlighted that it can be a challenge to get \ncitizens involved in participatory processes and \ndecision-making and to ensure that a diversity of \nvoices is represented in consultation processes. \n\nTechnological barriers\n\n\u2022 While the majority of survey respondents still \nidentified these as supporting, big data analytics \nand ICT were seen as a barrier by some cities and to \nneither support nor inhibit sustainability transitions \nby others.\n\n\u2022 These different views and experiences may be \nthe result of cities not making use of big data or \nbecause there is a lack of government capacity \nto integrate big data analytics and other forms of \nICT into existing decision-making processes. This \nissue was not touched upon much in the interviews \nand would require further investigation to confirm \nspecific barriers. \n\nData and information barriers\n\n\u2022 As regards measuring sustainability progress, cities \nface barriers surrounding the following factors: \ntimeliness (e.g. data are often too old to be useful), \naccessibility (e.g. format and ease of access) and \nquality (e.g. robustness, reliability, relevance, \ncomparability, compatibility) of data and information, \nwhich can all inhibit their sustainably efforts. \n\n\u2022 Another barrier mentioned in the interviews was the \nlack of data available at the city level, with national \nor regional-level data having to be used as a proxy \nin some instances, thereby preventing more locally \ntargeted responses. \n\nFinancial barriers\n\n\u2022 In terms of factors that were identified by some \ncities in the survey as inhibiting sustainability \ntransitions, the level of fiscal decentralisation stands \nout as the most important barrier.\n\n\u2022 This aligns with findings from the interviews, where \nlimited municipal budgets (arising from insufficient \nfiscal decentralisation) were repeatedly highlighted \nas a barrier. \n\n\u2022 Another related challenge was the limited \nability of some cities to raise their own taxes, \nwhich is exacerbated when there is a lack of \npolitical alignment between the city and higher \ntiers of government regarding environmental \npolicy\u00a0priorities.\t\n\f\nSummary of findings\n\n57Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\n4.3 General reflections on the \nresearch\u00a0approach\n\nThis relatively small-scale study was intended as a \nprototype \u2014 a way to test the approach of using \nliterature reviews, surveys and interviews with city \nauthorities to identify potential drivers and barriers to \nurban environmental sustainability transitions. This \nwork is largely based on the personal perception of \nrespondents and would need to be supplemented by \nadditional more quantitative analysis of the drivers \nand barriers that cities experience. Based on this first \nexperience, the approach can be replicated and revised \nin the future. The methodologies would allow for an \neasy scaling-up to include a larger sample of cities, \nwhich would enable more reliable insights into the \ndiverse drivers and barriers to urban environmental \ntransitions in different types of cities. It would also \nallow for an in-depth examination of specific enabling \nfactors (e.g. understanding the specific governance \ndrivers in more detail for a particular subset of cities). \nAnother interesting approach may be to explore what \nsupporting factors are absent in cities; this is a slightly \ndifferent analysis and involves more than merely \nlooking at concrete barriers. \n\nContext, alongside each of the six enabling factors in \nthe conceptual framework on urban environmental \nsustainability (i.e. governance, knowledge, culture, \ntechnology, data and information, finance) were \ngenerally seen by cities to support their sustainability \ntransitions. This is not surprising since these factors \nwere identified via an in-depth literature review and \nconsultation with stakeholders, although the survey \nprovided further empirical evidence of their relevance \nas important enablers of environmental sustainability. \nThis is not to suggest that the list of enabling factors is \nexhaustive and it may well be worth exploring if other \nenabling factors (or sub-categories of factors) were \nmissed in the initial literature review and stakeholder \nconsultation. It should be noted that cities had the \nopportunity to mention specific additional factors \nin free-form fields in the survey but none of the \nrespondents added any entirely new categories. \n\nOverall, few of the factors in the survey were identified \nas presenting serious barriers to environmental \nsustainability in cities. Even where some cities identified \na factor as a barrier, in all cases, some others suggested \nthat the same factor supported their sustainability \ntransitions. This may be partly due to the fact that all \ncities targeted by the survey are already 'sustainability \nleaders' and, as such, may have overcome many of the \nbarriers that could still be preventing other cities from \ntaking more decisive action in this area. \n\nExpanding the survey to include cities that may not \nyet be as advanced in their sustainability transitions \nwould be an interesting area for future research, given \nthat it would probably highlight additional barriers. In \naddition, the format of the survey did not provide the \ncities with an opportunity to explicitly list barriers they \nfelt were most inhibiting their sustainability transitions. \nIn contrast, interviews asked cities to reflect specifically \non the barriers they currently face or have faced in \nthe\u00a0past.\n\nOf all the elements of the conceptual framework \ntested via the survey, contextual factors were the \nmost polarising, with context identified as both \nstrongly supporting or strongly inhibiting sustainability \ntransitions. This is not surprising given the \nheterogeneity of the cities participating in the survey \nas well as the nature of the contextual factors, which \ncan be both a positive driver or a barrier depending \non the specific environmental sustainability objective \n(e.g.\u00a0urban\tform,\tgeographic\tlocation).\t\n\nThe interviews provided a lot more detail than the \nsurvey and, in most cases, acted as an important \ncomplement to the survey results, confirming many \nof the general trends that emerged from the survey \nin terms of the most important drivers of change. \nHowever, there were some areas where the survey \nresults and the findings from interviews diverged in \nterms of the factors seen as most significant. Given \nthat the interviews were only around an hour long, this \ncould mean that not all enabling factors and barriers \nwere covered.\n\f\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?58\n\nLessons and next steps\n\n5 Lessons and next steps\n\nBased on the findings summarised in the previous \nsection, a number of specific lessons emerge from this \nresearch. These lessons may be helpful to policymakers \nacross all levels of decision-making when identifying \nimportant levers of change that can help to accelerate \nurban environmental sustainability transitions across \nEuropean cities. They also provide important insights \nthat may be relevant to other urban stakeholders, \nincluding local citizens, NGOs and the research \ncommunity. Looking ahead, several continuations of \nthis research could be explored to build on this initial \nstudy and strengthen the understanding of how specific \nfactors either enable or hinder progress. These will be \ndiscussed briefly at the end of this concluding chapter. \n\n5.1 Lessons emerging from this research\n\nA number of early lessons that may give more \ninsight into the drivers and barriers of sustainability \ntransitions in European cities have emerged from \nthis research. These lessons were shaped by the \nresults from the survey and interviews, as well as by \nthe EEA/Eionet consultation. Bearing in mind that \nthis study is relatively limited in scope, these lessons \nwould have to be tested further, with a wider sample \nof cities, to confirm their robustness and to develop \nconcrete policy recommendations that emerge from \nthese\u00a0observations.\t\n\nCities are heterogenous and transition pathways need to \nbe tailored to local contexts \n\nThere are significant variations between cities as \nregards the most important drivers and barriers \nshaping their sustainability transitions. This highlights \nthe extreme heterogeneity of European cities and the \ndiverse urban sustainability pathways that exist. This \nis also relevant when it comes to EU legislation and \npolicy frameworks that must leave enough flexibility \nto enable cities to implement initiatives in ways that \nare most relevant and effective for them, respecting \nthe unique local drivers and barriers they face on \ntheir sustainability journey. It also suggests that cities \nwill have very different policy priorities and divergent \nabilities to influence specific sectors that are relevant \nto their sustainability transitions. Thus, identifying the \n\nmost relevant policy nexuses where sectoral challenges \ncan be tackled in an integrated manner is also likely to \nvary between cities. \n\nSome contextual factors are fixed and hard to change, \nbut many are dynamic and evolving \n\nUnderstanding the complex relationships between \nthe existing urban context and sustainability efforts \ncan help cities prioritise those environmental policies \nthat are the most appropriate for their individual \ncircumstances. Although a contextual factor that acts \nas a major barrier in one city may be largely irrelevant \nin another, what emerges clearly from the research is \nthat a good understanding of a city's context, and its \nconstantly evolving nature, are essential prerequisites \nto successful sustainability planning. Some contextual \nfactors cannot easily be changed (either because they \nare fixed, e.g. geographical context) or they occur at \na larger scale (e.g. climate change). Fixed contextual \nfactors form part of a city's distinctiveness and, \nwherever possible, they should be embraced as they \ncan enable unique ways of addressing sustainability \ntransitions. At the same time, many aspects of a \ncity's context are changeable (either by targeted \npolicy intervention or through more large-scale \nexternal forces) \u2014 an important reminder that cities \nare living systems. They are constantly evolving and \nurban policymaking must remain agile to respond \nto emerging challenges and new realities. Also, the \ncontextual factors the city can change or influence are \nvery often shaped in some way by external actors and \ndynamics that can either support or undermine local \nefforts (e.g. GDP, demographics).\n\nCity government's sustainability vision and strategic plan \nare vital as foundations for further action\n\nHaving an overall sustainability vision and associated \nstrategic plan at the city level is an essential precondition \nfor advancing towards ambitious environmental \ngoals. All cities highlighted the importance of having \nwell-thought-out plans that provide a clear trajectory \nand can act as a baseline for their sustainability \ntransitions, as well as committed leadership to \ndrive progress towards that vision. Despite this, it is \nimportant to note that a vision on its own will not lead \n\f\nLessons and next steps\n\n59Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nto change, and having clear and measurable targets \nin key sectors, as well as a system of accountability \nrelated to the achievement of these targets, is essential. \nAnother potential issue relates to the priorities that \nmay be included in a city's strategic plan, which are \noften conditioned by the issues and sectors a city can \nmeaningfully influence but are also influenced by \npolitical preferences and ideologies. This is why it is so \nessential for urban sustainability plans to align with \nand respond to wider programmes and plans set at the \nnational and EU level. \n\nEU laws and policy frameworks have a key role to play in \naccelerating sustainability changes in cities\n\nEU laws, standards and regulations, and access \nto EU funding play a major role in shaping local \nsustainability ambitions and actions. Cities are strongly \nincentivised, supported and even inspired by EU \nlegislation and strategies, such as the Green Deal, the \nEU\tUrban\tAgenda\tand\tvarious\tEU\tDirectives\t(e.g.\u00a0WFD,\t\nEED, EPBD). Compared to international initiatives \n(e.g.\u00a0UN\tSustainable\tDevelopment\tGoals,\tUN\tUrban\t\nAgenda), European regulations and initiatives are \nconsidered significantly more relevant to cities. This \nmay be because EU regulations are legally binding \nand are linked very clearly to other EU incentive \nmechanisms (e.g. funds, networks, awards). With the \nemergence of COVID-19, it is likely that leadership on \nkey sustainability issues from the EU and associated \nfunding will play an even bigger role in accelerating \nchange in European cities. \n\nNational and supranational governments can facilitate, \nas well as inhibit, systemic change \n\nNational and supranational governments can \naccelerate systemic change by facilitating knowledge \nexchange and supporting strong networks that enable \npeer-to-peer learning. Initiatives such as the EGCA \nand EGLA, and many other EU initiatives are crucial \nfor sharing knowledge and best practice. This is also \ntrue for collaborative European research initiatives \nthat provide the framework for cities to learn from \neach other and find innovative solutions to shared \nchallenges. At the same time, some cities did highlight \nthat a lack of alignment between local, national and \nsupranational priorities and objectives can undermine \nprogress, underscoring why it is so essential that \nurban leaders are consulted in wider decision-making \nprocesses related to the sustainability transition. \n\nCities benefit from greater decision-making powers and \nfiscal autonomy\n\nAlthough higher levels of government (EU, national, \nregional) clearly have an essential role to play in \n\nsupporting urban sustainability transitions, it tends \nto be beneficial for cities to have a greater degree \nof decision-making power and fiscal autonomy. The \nimportance of both fiscal and political decentralisation \nemerged repeatedly through this research, with \ncities stating it was essential for them to have a \nsubstantial level of independence when it comes \nto policy sectors that most acutely influence local \nsustainability outcomes. A lack of fiscal autonomy was \nrepeatedly highlighted as a barrier that constrains \ncities in accelerating their sustainability transition, \nparticularly when it comes to big investments, such \nas new transport infrastructure, that often exceed \ntheir capacity to finance independently. COVID-19 has \nalready had a significant impact on local government \nbudgets, so finding innovative ways to access local \nsources of revenue will have to be complemented by \nfinancial support from other tiers of government and \nthe private sector.\n\nCity networks and focused partnerships can add value\n\nAll cities identified the vital role of sharing knowledge \nand experiences with other cities, often facilitated \nthrough regional or thematic networks that enable them \nto co-create solutions to shared sustainability challenges. \nCity networks work best when they encourage \ncollaboration rather than competition and when their \nvalue added for individual member cities is very clear. \nHaving a safe space to share both successes and \nfailures was highlighted as an important aspect of such \nnetworks. Cities must take care not to overcommit to \ntoo many initiatives and rather to focus on the networks \nand partnerships that provide them with concrete inputs \nand support to help them to advance towards specific \ngoals. COVID-19 has also shown how city networks can \nbe essential not just for information sharing but also \nby enabling cities to speak with a unified voice, raising \ntheir collective profile in important policy conversations. \nRecent examples of this include the C40 Global Mayors \nCOVID-19 Recovery Task Force and explicit calls by the \nGlobal Covenant of Mayors and Eurocities for a green \nrecovery and cross-border solidarity. \n\nLocal research and experimentation can accelerate \ninnovation\n\nUrban sustainability transitions are inherently complex \nand often have to respond to 'wicked problems' that \ncan be difficult to solve or have unintended spillover \neffects. Research and experimentation are critical to \nidentifying locally appropriate solutions. Using the \ncity as a test bed can accelerate innovation because \nit ensures new approaches and technologies are \nappropriate for the local context. It also allows cities \nto think about the different sustainability nexuses that \nthey want to address and to find solutions that can lead \n\f\nLessons and next steps\n\n60 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nto co-benefits across different critical policy sectors. \nAt the same time, a supportive research agenda at \nthe EU and national levels is also needed to support \nand reinforce efforts by individual cities, while also \nproviding important insights into issues that are shared \nby a wide range of cities. Having an integrated strategic \nvision for the whole city that ensures that sustainability \nissues are not dealt with in a siloed way but instead \nbecome a shared responsibility can help to create a \ncommon understanding of sustainability issues across \nall sectors of government. \n\nInvolving various stakeholders and supporting effective \npublic engagement in decision-making processes leads \nto better outcomes\n\nIncluding a broad range of stakeholders from various \nsectors and across all levels of government and society \nin decision-making (e.g. drafting the city's strategic \nvison), and processes of knowledge production and \ninnovation tends to lead to better outcomes in terms \nof urban environmental sustainability transitions. \nThe sense of ownership and shared responsibility to \ndeal with environmental challenges can help to create \na common understanding of sustainability issues \nacross various sectors of society and government. \nAchieving sustainability transitions also requires public \nengagement in defining a city's visions and pathways \n\u2014\u00a0without\tthis\tbuy-in\tand\tparticipation\tit\tis\tvery\tdifficult\t\nto achieve positive change. Public engagement positively \ninfluences attitudes on sustainability and sets the scene \nfor the generation of feedback loops that further urban \nsustainability transitions at a later stage. Educating civil \nsociety through informative campaigns on sustainable \npolicies and plans equips citizens to place demands on \nmunicipalities to act, while also empowering individuals \nto take meaningful action within their own communities. \nHaving an engaged and empowered population that \nis open to new innovative technologies and willing to \nchange behaviours and habits, and embrace more \nsustainable lifestyles, can facilitate the implementation \nof more transformational changes. \n\nNew technologies can play an important role but need to \nbe inclusive and fit for purpose\n\nInnovation cannot be embraced for its own sake but \nrather must respond to genuine needs \u2014 first and \nforemost the need for more liveable and sustainable \ncities. While new technologies are not a panacea to \nall environmental challenges, care must be taken \nto ensure technologies do not have unintended \nconsequences or side effects (e.g. social exclusion \nand inequality in access to goods and services) \n\u2014\u00a0technological\tdevelopments\tplay\tan\timportant\trole\t\nin accelerating sustainability transitions in cities. As a \nresult, some cities are placing technological innovation \n\nat the centre of their sustainability transitions. \nFostering a culture of innovation and an atmosphere \nof creativity can help cities attract global technology \nfirms while also providing the right environment for \nlocal start-ups to thrive and facilitate new technology \ndevelopment and implementation on the ground. Often \nnew technologies will be more impactful if they are \nlinked to participatory and bottom-up approaches, for \nexample, by enabling the involvement of local residents \nthrough citizen science to help collect scientific data, \nmonitor local biodiversity, identify pollution hot spots \nor even to map vulnerabilities to disasters.\n\nUpdated and accessible data and information is needed \nto monitor progress\n\nBetter data and information generally lead to better \nenvironmental management, making it easier \nto demonstrate progress towards specific goals. \nInitiatives such as the EGCA and EGLA, EU Directives, \nand membership of other EU networks help cities \nto identify areas where they may be lagging behind \nand incentivises them to improve their data- and \ninformation-collection processes. To enhance \ndata-collection practices, data quality and availability at \nthe local level, it can be helpful for cities to collaborate \nwith national statistics offices to understand what data \nshould be collected at more granular levels, as well \nas the types of indicators that should be monitored. \nAgain, new technologies can play an important role in \nboth data collection and analysis, but a proliferation \nof data is only as useful as a city's capacity to analyse \nit and integrate it into its decision-making processes. \nThis is why it is essential for cities to acquire the skills \nto work with large datasets that can help them to \nidentify patterns and track the impact of specific policy \ninterventions. This is also an important reminder \nthat the provision of timely, relevant and accessible \nEuropean-level data and information on environmental \nissues is essential for cities and should remain a priority \nfor agencies such as the EEA. \n\nCommunicating information effectively and innovatively \nis an important part of engaging the public \n\nThinking in innovative ways about how data and \ninformation can be presented to highlight challenges \nor new initiatives can ensure that the public is clear \nabout what the city is aiming to achieve and how they \ncan be part of the sustainability transition. Innovative \ncommunication includes more qualitative storytelling, \nand accessible and attractive ways of data visualisation \nand presentation, as well as better availability of \nrelevant open data (e.g. appropriate scale, thematic). All \nthis can improve the accessibility and understanding of \nrelevant information for the public and various other \nstakeholders and can support urban environmental \n\f\nLessons and next steps\n\n61Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nsustainability transitions. Cities also mentioned other \nideas, such as having high-profile 'champions' to \npromote more sustainable behaviours, involving the \npublic and private sector through competitions and \nevents where the public can try out new technologies, \nand regular town-hall meetings and other ways of \nengaging that enable dialogue with citizens and the \ndevelopment of shared sustainability objectives. \n\nAccessing EU, national and private funding plays a \ncritical role \n\nGovernments can accelerate systemic change by \nreorienting financial flows towards sustainable \ninvestments and developing relevant knowledge \nsystems and skills to support these. Wealthier \ncities may find it easier to independently invest in \nimportant sustainability initiatives and upgrade urban \ninfrastructure. However, particularly for cities with less \nown-source revenues, knowing how to access other \nsources of funding at EU and national levels can play a \ncritical role in overcoming this barrier. These sources of \nfunding are likely to become even more essential in the \naftermath of COVID-19, when municipal budgets are \nlikely to be considerably constrained. Even though EU \nfunding may be available, applying for such funds can \nbe time-consuming and require a particular skillset that \nnot all local authorities necessarily possess. This means \nthat access to EU funds is not equally distributed across \nEurope and may not always reach the cities that need it \nmost. Public-private partnerships are another way cities \ncan increase investment in sustainable infrastructure. \nSuccessful collaboration with the private sector can \naccelerate progress towards core policy objectives \nwhile, at the same time, providing significant benefits \nfor local businesses.\n\nGreen procurement processes and sustainable \nconsumption are important drivers of change\n\nGreen procurement practices provide an opportunity \nfor cities to align public spending with core \nenvironmental objectives. Simplifying and supporting \ngreen procurement processes is therefore an \nimportant potential driver of change. The EU is already \nsupporting cities in this process through initiatives such \nas the EcoProcura conference series, which enables \ncities to exchange best practices when it comes to \nmore sustainable procurement processes. While cities \nare making progress on changing the environmental \nfootprint of consumption, at times, decisions \ncontrolled directly by the local authority, private \nconsumer spending decisions and investments are still \nundermining sustainability outcomes. Ensuring that \nindividuals use their purchasing power correctly can be \nchallenging for cities to influence. However, this was \n\nmentioned several times as an important area where \nmore progress is required. \n\n5.2 Future research opportunities\n\nThis report has provided an overview of some of the \ndrivers and barriers identified as being significant \nin shaping environmental sustainability transitions \nin a relatively small subset of European cities. The \nfindings and emerging lessons should only be seen \nas an entry point into a wider conversation about the \ndrivers of urban sustainability transitions. Further \nresearch would be needed to develop a more \ndefinitive overview of the multitude of complex and \ninterrelated factors that shape sustainability outcomes \nin European cities. \n\nLooking ahead, a number of important pieces of followon work emerge from this initial analysis, which the EEA \nand other interested parties may want to explore:\n\nExpanding the survey to include more cities\n\n\u2022 The first and most obvious opportunity would be to \nroll out the survey to a wider selection of European \ncities. Ensuring that a higher percentage of winners \nand finalists of the EGCA and EGLA respond to the \nsurvey would be one potential avenue. \n\n\u2022 At the same time, this sample of cities is clearly \nalready leading when it comes to environmental \nsustainability initiatives. It may therefore be of \ninterest to widen the survey to include all cities that \nhave so far applied to the EGCA and EGLA, or even \nthose that have yet to apply. This would provide \nmore interesting insights into the experiences \nof cities that are perhaps at an earlier stage of \ntheir sustainability journey. It would also shed \nsome light on the barriers they face and allow \nfor an exploration as to how these might best \nbe\u00a0overcome.\t\n\n\u2022 Moving beyond EGCA and EGLA as a 'filter' to \nidentify cities, another avenue could be to use \nthe extensive city networks the EEA has access \nto through partners such as Eurocities and ICLEI \n(both members of the external stakeholder \ngroup). This would allow the survey to be shared \nwith a potentially much wider pool of cities, \nensuring a more representative cross-section of \nsurvey\u00a0respondents.\t\n\n\u2022 A further benefit from expanding the survey in this \nway would be that the larger sample size would \nallow for more sophisticated analyses of the results. \n\f\nLessons and next steps\n\n62 Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nThe current study worked with a sample size below \n30, which makes it difficult to generalise some of \nthe results and also means that any analysis of \ndifferences on the basis of geography, city size or \nany other typology were not appropriate. \n\n\u2022 It would be very interesting to see if a larger \nsample size could begin to highlight any particular \npatterns in how the drivers and barriers manifest \nacross different types of cities, thereby enabling \nmore nuanced recommendations and a more \ncomparative approach. This would also allow some \ncities to be clustered by themes in order to start to \ndiscern whether there are very clear differences.\n\nInterviewing a wider range of cities or using interviews \nfor in-depth examinations of specific topics\n\n\u2022 As with the survey, the interviews only covered a \nrelatively small number of cities (7), which limits \nthe extent to which the findings can be generalised \nand drawn on for broader conclusions for EU \npolicy-making. Engaging further with the same set \nof cities that filled out the survey would also create \na sense of continuity and co-creation whereby they \nfeel they are active participants in the research.\n\n\u2022 It would be valuable to expand the number of \ncities interviewed, either to other cities that have \nalready filled out the survey or even to those that \nare not part of the EGCA and EGLA process. This \nwould help to understand the perspectives of cities \nthat may either be at a much earlier stage in their \nsustainability journey or are perhaps struggling with \nparticular barriers. \n\n\u2022 Another option for further interviews might be \nto use them for in-depth investigations to better \nunderstand the specifics of a particular driver \nor barrier in relation to different topics. For \nexample, interviews might focus only on the role \nof financing/technology/data and how this specific \nfactor is helping or hindering individual urban \nsustainability\u00a0transitions.\t\n\nLinking the findings to major new EU policy initiatives as \nwell as the coronavirus pandemic\n\n\u2022 The research was completed ahead of the \npublication of a number of important EU initiatives, \nincluding the EEA's SOER 2020 report, the EU \nBiodiversity Strategy for 2030, the revised Leipzig \nCharter and the European Green Deal. It would be \nuseful to analyse to what extent the key findings \nfrom this piece of work align with the priorities \nset out in these new policy documents and to use \n\nthis to identify important gaps where the efforts \nof cities to transition might be better supported \nthrough existing EU initiatives and legislation. \n\n\u2022 The survey and interviews were completed before \nthe coronavirus pandemic swept across Europe. \nIn the aftermath, cities, nations and the EU will \nhave to find a way to recover from the human and \neconomic toll of the pandemic, while ensuring \nthat the inevitable economic challenges do not \nundermine urgent agendas related to climate \nchange and ecological restoration. Research into \nthe types of recovery packages that will allow \nus to 'build back better', while also accelerating \nprogress towards environmental sustainability \nin Europe's cities, will be of critical importance \nand this report could provide an entry point into \nthese discussions. Of course, the emergence \nof COVID-19 has also fundamentally changed \npriorities across European cities \u2014 thus, repeating \nthis research and comparing how drivers and \nbarriers may have changed over the past year \nwould\talso\tbe\ta\tvaluable\u00a0approach.\n\nExploring wider themes and subject areas that may be \ndriving the sustainability transition\n\n\u2022 Some themes did not emerge as clearly from \nthis research as might have been expected. \nThese includes the importance of urban and \nterritorial planning, especially how differences in \nplanning and urban development contexts among \ndifferent cities may shape their sustainability \ntransitions. In light of current updates to the EU \nTerritorial Agenda (EC, 2020c) and the imminent \npublication of a revised Leipzig Charter (URBACT, \n2020), integrated urban development may be an \nimportant aspect to explore in follow-up research, \nensuring that these important conversations and \nemerging policy priorities are more adequately \nreflected in this analysis and that the link between \nurban planning and environmental sustainability is \nexplored in more depth. \n\n\u2022 Another important theme that did not emerge \nfrom the research was governance for \ntransformation, including discussions of how \ncities are creating a climate for innovation within \nthe municipality, where new approaches can \nbe tested without the fear of failure and where \nfailure is seen as a means of learning and growth. \nUnderstanding to what extent such openness for \nexperimentation embedded in local government \nculture can accelerate progress towards greater \nenvironmental sustainability may be a relevant \nfocus for future research. Related to this, work to \n\f\nLessons and next steps\n\n63Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?\n\nbetter understand the difference between more \ntop-down leadership on sustainability versus more \nbottom-up drivers emerging from civil society and \nthe public might also be of value. Furthermore, it \nmight be beneficial to collect views at national and \nregional governance levels on factors relevant for \nurban environmental sustainability transitions. \n\n\u2022 While this work was very explicitly focused on \nunderstanding the drivers of environmental \nsustainability transitions, it is also important to \nunderstand what the social and economic drivers \nof sustainability in cities might be. Therefore, \nfurther research may seek to broaden the scope \nto include a wider selection of drivers and barriers. \nSimilarly, understanding interlinkages between \nthese different drivers and barriers could be \nexplored further. Topics such as mobility in cities, \nnoise, green spaces and land-use change are \nall connected. To a certain extent, this will be \n\nexplored in the forthcoming EEA work on nexus \nanalysis, although it may be useful to take this more \nintegrated approach as a starting point for future \nprimary research with specific cities. \n\n\u2022 Finally, it would be valuable to explore the role of \nlock-ins and path dependencies in greater detail. \nThis would help us to understand how cities \nmight be supported to move from incremental \nimprovements and fairly linear progress to more \ntransformative action and accelerated change. \nThe COVID-19 crisis is adding to the urgency of \nthis type of research, given that cities are currently \nfacing unprecedented pressures to respond to \ndeeply interlinked health, social, economic and \nenvironmental challenges. There is a real risk \nthat the gains made in recent years in urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions may either \nslow down or even be reversed unless cities are \nsupported in their efforts to build back better.\n\f\nUrban Sustainability in Europe \u2014 What is driving cities' environmental change?64\n\nReferences \n\nReferences\n\nAlexandru, C.

The responses to this survey and \nthe associated analysis will directly inform the EEA's \nwork on urban sustainability, notably the Urban \nSustainability in Europe \u2013 Avenues for change report (EEA, \nforthcoming). It also aims to provide important lessons \nabout the way in which cities and national governments \ncan foster more sustainable urban growth that protects \nthe environment and creates thriving, low-carbon and \nclimate-resilient communities that promote economic \nvitality, health, wellbeing and social inclusion. \n\nYour city has been contacted because you are either \na winner or finalist in the prestigious European Green \nCapital or European Green Leaf Awards, which were \nchosen as the most appropriate benchmark for urban \nsustainability leadership across Europe. Responses \nacross a wide range of different cities are critical to the \nsuccess of the survey, and your participation is greatly \nappreciated. By participating, you can directly support \nthe EEA's assessments and consequently inform policy \ndebate and formulation at the EU level and beyond. We \nalso hope you find it a useful process of reflection on its \nown and that it can propose or trigger new ideas and \ninsights\tinto\turban\tpolicymaking\tas\tyou\ttake\tpart.\u00a0\n\nResponding to this survey\n\nReplies may be submitted in English language only. The \nsurvey should take about 20-30 minutes to complete. \nHowever, when responding to the questions you might \nwish to consult your colleagues, thus responding to the \nquestionnaire might take longer. You may interrupt \nyour session at any time and continue answering at a \nlater stage. If you do so, please remember to keep \nthe link to your saved answers as this is the only \nway to access them. Once you have submitted your \nanswers online, you will be able to download a copy of \nthe completed questionnaire. \n\nThe survey is being conducted by Collingwood \nEnvironmental Planning (CEP) and LSE Cities at the \nLondon School of Economics on behalf of the EEA. In \naddition to the results from this questionnaire, there \nwill be follow-up interviews with a selection of cities \nthat have responded to the survey. \n\nPublication of contributions\n\nThis survey is conducted using the European \nCommission's platform EUSurvey. This platform \nconforms to the policy on the protection of personal \ndata by the European institutions. Please note that \nthe responses received will be used to form the basis \nof our report that will be published online.

Similarly, the Green Leaf Award 2022 \u2014 for \ncities of 20\u00a0000 to 100\u00a0000 inhabitants \u2014 was awarded to the \nPortuguese city, Valongo and Winterswijk in the Netherlands. \nI had the privilege of taking part in jury deliberations for both \ncompetitions. It was extremely inspiring and enriching to see the \nmagnitude of the actions Europe\u2019s cities are taking as they move \ntowards sustainability and prepare for the challenges ahead. Yet, \nthe path to urban sustainability is not an easy one. \n\nCities are home to about three out of four Europeans. Cities \nare complex systems, uniting businesses, communities and the \nenvironment in a living, continuously evolving setting. They are \nsocial, cultural and economic centres, embedded in the regions \nsurrounding them. Despite these commonalities, each city \nand town in Europe is unique, with its own features developed \nthroughout history and shaped by its geography, its inhabitants \nand its socio-political systems. Consequently, the challenges \nfaced by cities can vary significantly. Some cities face ageing \nor shrinking populations, whereas others might be growing. \nDecline in an economic sector, such as tourism or fisheries, can \nseverely affect some cities\u2019 economies, while others can act as \neconomic innovation magnets, attracting young talent from \nacross the EU. Similarly, the environmental impacts of different \ncities might differ considerably. \n\nMost European cities have been continuously inhabited for \ncenturies and their streets, neighbourhoods and buildings reflect \nthis heritage. Historical urban patterns and landscapes, as well \nas transport networks, influence how easily cities can become \nsustainable as a result of, for example, replacing building stock \nor retrofitting existing buildings or transport options. At the \nsame time, despite their unique features and challenges, all \ncities need to take measures to prepare for the climate impacts \nthey might face. Every city must contribute to climate neutrality, \nthe circular economy and biodiversity objectives, while ensuring \na cleaner and healthier environment and providing better social \nand economic opportunities for its inhabitants. \n\nThe end goal might be the same but the path towards \nsustainability for each city will need to cater for their unique \n\nset of characteristics and challenges. We, at the European \nEnvironment Agency, have been bringing stakeholders together \n\u2014 including many winners and finalists of the European Green \nCapital and Green Leaf Awards \u2014 to develop a common \nunderstanding of the role of cities in environment and \nsustainability transitions. \n\nBased on a co-created conceptual framework, this common \nunderstanding is at the core of our recent urban sustainability \npublications, as well as this report and upcoming assessments \non the issue. The framework aims to help city authorities and \npolicy makers design their own sustainability transition by \nlooking at urban sustainability as a whole through six different \nlenses: circular city, resilient city, low-carbon city, green city, \ninclusive city and healthy city.\u00a0 It also analyses how some key \nenablers of sustainability \u2014 governance, knowledge, culture, \ntechnology, finance and data and information \u2014 can drive \nor hinder urban transitions towards sustainability. Finally, it \nintroduces the concept of an urban nexus and exemplifies \nits use in a city context via a preliminary assessment of eight \npriority nexus, highlighting the need for policy integration.\n\nMany of our online tools, such as the European Air Quality \nIndex, the European City Air Quality viewer and various \nthematic assessments and indicators show that different towns \nand cities will be impacted differently by climate change. Coastal \ncities, especially on the Northwest Atlantic coast, for example, \nwill face greater storm surge risks, while others in the south \nwill face water shortages. Our studies also show that some \ncommunities and groups within a given city could be even more \nvulnerable as they might be affected by multiple environmental \nhazards, such as air pollution or noise pollution. \n\nFrom creating green and blue areas within the city centre to \nintegrating public transport with active mobility systems like \ncycling and walking, or more effective recycling systems, there \nare many areas in which cities can take action in their transition \ntowards urban sustainability. Wider uptake of technological \ndevelopments such as electric vehicles or remote working can \nspeed up the process. It is also clear from European Green \nCapitals like Copenhagen that a long-term and coherent \nvision supported by relevant governance structures can truly \ntransform a city in just a couple of decades. \n\nHans Bruyninckx \nEEA Executive Director\n\nhttps://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fenvironment%2Feuropeangreencapital%2F&data=04%7C01%7CAndy.Martin%40eea.europa.eu%7Ce0aedf0aa3854697170c08d98d77d367%7Cbe2e7beab4934de5bbc58b4a6a235600%7C1%7C0%7C637696368567272116%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Wcb2ZsMceNfgUO%2BuuiORsZ9fR6Ecf%2F%2B61bVKI%2FLXPto%3D&reserved=0\f\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change6\n\n\u00a9 Chuttersnap, on Unsplash\n\f\n7Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nLead authors\n\nRic Eales, Owen White, Rolands Saudaskis and Spela Kolaric (All \nCEP), Catarina Heeckt and Philipp Rode (Both LSE Cities) and \nIvone Pereira Martins (EEA)\n\nOther contributors \n\nThe EEA would like to acknowledge the support of the members \nof the EEA urban stakeholder group that contributed to the \nstudy design, scrutinised the research findings via multiple \nin-person and virtual stakeholder meetings and provided \nconstructive feedback that supported the development of this \nreport.

However, the research \nfor this report and the development of the EEA's approach to \nurban environmental sustainability was largely finalised before \nthe coronavirus emerged in Europe. \n\nWe know that cities have been at the forefront of the health \ncrisis from the very beginning, not only bearing the worst \nimpacts but also becoming essential actors in proactively \nand innovatively addressing the health emergency, as well as \ndealing with the wider social and economic ramifications. It is \nclear that city, national and EU budgets will come under strain \nas a result of the economic crisis, which may result in reduced \nbudgets for core environmental initiatives in the years ahead. \n\nAt the same time, many policies that have been implemented \nprimarily to deal with the health emergency will also have \nlong-term environmental benefits (e.g. improved active travel \ninfrastructure) and there is a growing movement of cities in \nEurope actively committing to a green recovery from the crisis \n\u2014\u00a0supported by initiatives at the EU level, such as the European \nGreen Deal. \n\nThe pandemic is highlighting the importance of addressing  \nthe nexus objectives presented in this report. For example, \nbecause of the pandemic and its cascading effects across \nsystems (e.g. mobility, food) many cities have had to reconsider \ntheir resilience to large shocks, including to climate change  \n(see the Climate resilience nexus). Many policies that have  \nbeen implemented primarily to deal with the health emergency \nwill also have long-term benefits for other nexus objectives  \n(e.g. environmental, quality of life, resilience), as highlighted  \nin the summary of the nexus analysis. \n\nThe research summarised in this report on the drivers of and \nbarriers to cities transitioning towards more environmental \nsustainability, including the survey and interviews with city \nrepresentatives, were finalised just as the coronavirus emerged \nin Europe. Therefore, the data do not capture how COVID-19 \nand its aftermath may be affecting the profiled cities and their \n\nperspectives on the urban sustainability transition. Wherever \npossible, this report reflects briefly on the ways that some \nof the observed drivers and barriers may be shaped by the \ncoronavirus crisis. However, it should be noted that this is \npurely speculative and is not based on empirical evidence \nfrom any of the participating cities. Follow-up research would \nbe required to understand if and how their answers may have \nchanged in the light of this new reality. \n\nAs regards cultural shifts, similar uncertainties exist. While \npeople may be more attuned to the importance of clean air \nand high-quality green spaces, we are also seeing, for example, \ngrowth in single-use plastics, and a renewed preference for \nthe use of private cars over public transport, which may have \nserious environmental consequences. \n\nWhat is clear is that, for most Europeans, the pandemic  \nhas caused abrupt changes in daily routines that will have  \nfar-reaching consequences for cities. For many urban dwellers, \nworking from home has become the new normal, video \nconferences have replaced face-to-face meetings (and related \nbusiness travel), online shopping is taking over from physical \nretail, and people are becoming better acquainted with their \nimmediate neighbourhoods and local green spaces. \n\nThe coronavirus crisis is clearly a challenge of unprecedented \nproportions, while also offering a window of opportunity that \nmay accelerate sustainability transformations in cities.  \nFrom the perspective of both research and practice, it is  \nclear that there is a long agenda of issues that will have  \nto be tackled in the months and years ahead. These include,  \nfor example, what a green recovery looks like for different  \ncities; the meaning of urbanity and the appropriate mix of  \nland uses; new requirements for the design of the public  \nrealm and green spaces; opportunities and challenges \npresented by new modes of transport; changes in urban \nfunctions (e.g. homes becoming the hub of day-to-day life  \nand office buildings being converted to housing); the impact  \non local business and service providers (e.g. less inner-city \nfootfall); the role of technology and digital futures; urban and \nregional production and value chains; and considerations  \nof new forms of urban decision-making. \n\f\nCovid-19 preamble\n\n9Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nWhile current efforts are rightly focused on tackling the immediate \nchallenges posed by the pandemic, it is important to swiftly put \nin place recovery pathways that align with wider sustainability \nobjectives. The EU's ambition of climate neutrality by 2050 and \nits European Green Deal must stay on track, while continuing to \nrecognise the profound societal changes we are undergoing. \n\nMoving forward, it will be ever more important to ensure a fair \ntransition for all while rebuilding our economies sustainably. \n\nOne important legacy of this crisis is likely to be the realisation \nthat behaviours, institutions and even infrastructure can be \nchanged a lot faster than may have previously been assumed. \nWe are not as 'locked-in' to certain ways of doing things as we \nthought and, if needed, can radically transform how our cities \noperate and how we operate within them. This has important \nimplications for cities when it comes to the transformation \nof systems that will be required to tackle the climate and \necological crisis in the years to come. \n\f\n\u00a9 Azgan Mjeshtri, on Unsplash\n\f\n11Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe urban dimension to Europe's sustainability \nchallenge \n\nThis report is the EEA's flagship report on urban environmental \nsustainability.

Cities  \nconcentrate people, jobs and economic activity. However,  \nthis also means that they are disproportionately affected  \nby social challenges such as segregation, poverty and \ninequality (EC, 2016a).  \n\nAssessment and reporting outputs\n\nMethod and context outputs\n\nTHE MAIN REPORT\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\nAvenues for change\n\nFlagship report on urban environmental\nsustainability setting out the EEA's conceptual\n\nframework and summary of analysis\nor urban nexuses and drivers\n\nThe Covid-19 briefing\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nOpportunities for challenging times\n\nAn initial overview of key impacts of \nthe pandemic on urban environmental \n\nsustainability, and lessons from how \ncities are responding\n\nThe methodology report\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nA stakeholder-led assessment process\n\nDescribes the stakeholder-led process of \ndeveloping and applying the knowledge\n\nbase and conceptual framework for\nurban environmental sustainability\n\nThe glossary\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 \nGlossary of key terms and concepts\n\nA glossary of key terms and concepts\n used in the EEA's work on urban \n\nenvironmetal sustainability\n\nThe nexus assessments\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\n Learning from nexus analysis\n\nAn assessment of eight urban \nsustainability nexuses to explore the \n\ncomplexity of urban systems and \nhighlight policy priorities\n\nThe drivers report\n\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014\nWhat is driving cities\u2019 environmental change?\n\nExplores the factors driving urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions\nin selected cities.

The EEA's  \nin-depth analysis of drivers of change of relevance for Europe's \nenvironment and sustainability (EEA, 2020a) emphasised that \ncities have a primary role in pushing forward societal change by \npromoting the circulation of ideas and encouraging social and \ntechnological innovations, experiments and changes in values, \nlifestyles and approaches to governance. \n\nCities are therefore both places where systemic challenges must \nbe met and places of opportunity to address these challenges. Of \ncourse, cities differ enormously in the challenges they face and \nthe tools they have available to address them. Sharing concrete \nexamples of the many different expressions of urban sustainability \ncan help to inspire city governments, irrespective of their context, \nto recognise that there is a transition pathway that is right for them. \n\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework \n\nAlthough there is no single agreed definition of urban \nsustainability, or what a sustainable city might look like, there  \nis broad agreement on what contributes to urban sustainability. \nThis includes the need to address economic, social and \nenvironmental issues in an integrated way and to ensure  \nthat cities are inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. For the \nEEA, urban environmental sustainability means encouraging \nrevitalisation and transitions of urban areas and cities to improve \nliveability, promote innovation and reduce environmental \nimpacts while maximising economic and social co-benefits. \n\nUrban systems are inherently complex, as is the concept of \nurban environmental sustainability. To help understand the \nrange of factors that will influence the transition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability, a conceptual framework for \nurban environmental sustainability has been developed. The \nframework is designed to help support assessment and analysis. \n\nThe conceptual framework is based on four main components \n(see Figure ES.2). These are: \n\n\u2022 Lenses \u2014 a range of perspectives on urban environmental \nsustainability that represent priority issues or concerns \nreflecting the EEA's environmental remit and can be used \nto guide/focus assessment and analysis. \n\n\u2022 Context \u2014 the range of current and historical, physical, \nsocial and institutional characteristics that create and shape \nthe setting in which a specific city exists, develops and \nfunctions. Each city's context has a considerable influence \non the transition to urban environmental sustainability. \n\n\u2022 Enabling factors \u2014 relatively high-level forces that, based \non their level of availability, can facilitate (drivers) or hinder \n(barriers) the transition towards urban environmental \nsustainability. \n\n\u2022 Building blocks \u2014 key qualities that contribute to urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Depending on the context \nand enabling factors, different building blocks will be the \ninputs required to transition towards urban environmental \nsustainability. \n\nThe conceptual framework is intended to be applied in different \nways to support the analysis of cities from the perspective of \nenvironmental sustainability. It has been used to develop and \ninform the analysis of urban nexuses and research into drivers \nof and barriers to sustainability in cities that are summarised in \nthis report. \n\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, \ncost-effective actions \n\nTo address systemic environmental challenges and \naccommodate a greater number of people in the coming \ndecades while improving the quality of life of their residents, \nEuropean cities must urgently shift towards a more  \nintegrated approach to policy and action. There is a need for \ncross-cutting strategies to address key systems (e.g. energy, \nmobility) and support the transformation to a low-carbon and \ncircular economy. Nexus analysis provides a way of helping  \nto understand complex systems and identify better  \ncoordinated polices and actions to support urban \nenvironmental sustainability. \n\nDrawing on the conceptual framework, literature review  \nand stakeholder input, eight example nexuses were selected  \nfor assessment: \n\n\u2022 Climate resilience nexus\n\n\u2022 Quality of life nexus \n\n\u2022 Urban accessibility nexus \n\n\u2022 Environment and health nexus \n\n\u2022 Food security nexus \n\n\u2022 Closing the loop nexus \n\n\u2022 Clean energy nexus \n\n\u2022 Sustainable buildings nexus. \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n13Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nFigure ES.2  Conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\nCU\nLT\n\nURE \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGOVERNANCE  \n\n \n \n\nKNOW\nLEDGE \n\nTECH\nN\n\nOLOGY \n \n\n \n\n \nDATA AND INFORMATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFI\nN\n\nAN\nCE\n\n \n\nEnvironmental \nquality\n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nPublic \nopen space\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nEcological\nmulti\nfunctionality\n\nSustainable \nurban\n\n agriculture\n\nRenewable\nenergy\n\nLow energy\n consumption\n\nEnergy \nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial \n\nuse and zero \nwaste\n\nResource \nefficiency\n\nSustainable\nmobility\n\nGreen\neconomy\n\nBuilt \nenvironmental\n\nquality\n\nIntegrated\nplanning\n\nHousing\nplanning\n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \n\njustice\n\nParticipation\nand\n\nempowerment\n\nCollaborative \nand \n\ncommunity-led\ninitiatives\n\nTHE\n(SUSTAINABLE)\n\nCITY\n\nLow-carbon city lens\n\nCircular city lens\n\nHealthy city lens\n\nInclusive city lens\n\nGreen city lens\n\nResilient city lens\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nEnabling factors\n\nLenses\n\nContext (the geography of a \nparticular city as well as its urban \nform, infrastructure, people, \ninstitutions, etc.)\n\nCO2\n\nCONTEXT\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n14 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThe urban nexus approach can help to identify opportunities to \ncoordinate policymaking and action. Policymaking and action \nare often developed in silos, addressing specific sectors or \nissues, with sometimes competing objectives. The urban nexus \napproach, through which two or more urban policy areas are \nconsidered together, can help identify synergies, co-benefits \nand trade-offs. In this way opportunities can be prioritised to \nachieve better coordinated and cost-effective policymaking  \nand action. \n\nTo achieve sustainability transitions, policy needs to be \nintegrated vertically as well as horizontally. Cities often have \na degree of autonomy in their governance and so they can, \nto some extent, influence change independently. However, \ncities also have interrelationships and interdependencies at \ndifferent scales, including at the EU and national scales, as well \nas with neighbourhoods and communities. The nexus approach \nfocuses on the horizontal integration of policy within a city; \nhowever, it is also important to consider vertical integration \nof policy between a city and other scales. \n\nThe priority urban nexuses analysed illustrate how \ninterconnected and complex urban systems are. They operate \nat different levels and interact in many ways. For example, \nmeeting the nexus objective of urban climate resilience relates \nto other nexus objectives, in particular quality of life, urban \naccessibility, environment and health, and food security. \nHowever, assessing the nexuses individually helps break down \nthe challenges into more manageable issues while also still \nconsidering their interconnectedness. \n\nLooking across the lessons emerging from the nexus analysis \nsome overall policy and governance implications are identified; \n\n\u2022 Cities are complex systems, and a wide range of different \ntypes of actions are seen across the nexuses and can be \nlinked to high-level policy agendas (e.g. at the EU scale). \nHowever, the nexus analysis shows that in practice \na relatively small number of policy agendas can \nbe identified that may be key to achieving urban \nenvironmental sustainability. A total of 18 policy agendas \nwere identified, for example building adaptive capacity and \nreducing vulnerability to climate change; improving the \nquality of and access to public open space, and creating \nor improving green infrastructure and urban ecology; \nusing digital technology; and promoting participation and \nempowerment of stakeholders and citizens. \n\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to remain intertwined \nwith policymaking and actions across sectors and affect \nthe transition to urban environmental sustainability \nin the immediate future and longer term. Although the \noverall implications of COVID-19 on progress towards the \nnexus objectives is unclear, many of the actions envisaged \nwill be influenced by the response to and need to recover \nfrom the pandemic. Cities may have an opportunity to take \nadvantage of the moment to implement a green recovery. \n\n\u2022 A lack of coordinated and integrated policy and  \naction can result in trade-offs. The analysis showed  \nthat nexuses interact through thematic and hierarchical \nlinks, as well as through specific actions and interventions. \nAn action intended to help achieve one nexus objective  \ncan lead directly to trade-offs in the achievement of other  \nnexus objectives. \n\n\u2022 Some actions provide opportunities to deliver \nco-benefits simultaneously across various urban \nsustainability objectives in a cost-effective way. For \nexample, developing and improving green infrastructure in \ncities can help to reduce flood risk and urban overheating \n(Climate resilience nexus), reduce air and noise pollution \nand encourage active travel (Environment and health \nnexus), and improve people's satisfaction with their \nsurroundings (Quality of life nexus). \n\n\u2022 Cities are well-placed to be leaders in delivering the \ntransition to a low-carbon sustainable economy and \nhave a pivotal role in achieving related EU policy \nobjectives. For most of the policy areas across the nexuses, \ncities can design, resource and implement sector-specific \npolicy and actions without necessarily requiring the \nreform of the policymaking process at national and/or EU \nscales. However, EU and national governments also have \nan important role in ensuring complementarity between \npolicy at different scales and in helping cities to overcome \nchallenges to achieving the nexus objectives. \n\n\u2022 Achieving urban sustainability will require new \ngovernance approaches. Such approaches could include \nsystematic identification of conflicts and barriers across policy \nsectors, horizontal and vertical integration and coordination of \nmeasures, empowerment of all residents and enabling them \nto have a greater say in urban decision-making. \n\n\u2022 Citizens and communities are fundamental to help \nmove cities towards reaching their urban sustainability \nobjectives. People are a fundamental part of the various \nsystems (food, energy, transport, etc.); thus to be truly \neffective, equitable action and collaboration must be central \nto any policy responses. \n\n\u2022 The nexus analysis could make use of composite \nindicators. The nexus analysis shows that there is a limited \nnumber of such indicators available that could support \nnexus assessment. This contrasts with the abundance of \nquantitative contextual indicators focusing on a single topic. \n\n\u2022 The nexus analysis is a useful approach to improve \nurban policy integration. Applying this approach \nencourages communication and coordination and can \nhelp decision-makers to identify key actions to meet the \nselected urban sustainability objectives. Potential blind \nspots in decision-making processes can also be uncovered \nby highlighting potential trade-offs. \n\f\nExecutive summary \n\n15Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n\u2022 The EEA conceptual framework for urban environmental \nsustainability is useful for decision-makers in identifying \nkey actions in the context of meeting the selected urban \nsustainability objectives. The lenses and building blocks that \nare embedded in the framework can help to identify the \nfocus of analysis and provide a set of relevant actions to \ncontribute to urban environmental sustainability.\n\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience \n\nA meta-analysis was undertaken aiming to improve the \nunderstanding of the drivers of change that can either enable \nor hinder urban environmental sustainability transitions in \nEuropean cities. Given the EEA's remit and interests, the focus of this \nresearch was on urban environmental sustainability transitions. \n\nThe analysis was based on a mixed methods approach that \ncombined a literature review, a survey of European cities \n(with\u00a026 responding) and semi-structured interviews with seven \ncase study cities that helped to deepen and contextualise the \nsurvey results. The survey focused on 'frontrunner' cities that \nhave either won or been selected as finalists in the European \nGreen Capital Awards or the European Green Leaf Awards. The \nsurvey was structured around a series of potential drivers and \nbarriers \u2014 actions that are 'supporting or inhibiting' transitions \nto urban environmental sustainability. \n\nA number of lessons emerge from the research: \n\n\u2022 Cities are heterogeneous and transition pathways need to \nbe tailored to local contexts. Drivers and barriers can differ \ngreatly between cities, and their diverse needs and capacities \nneed to be taken into account and supported by EU, national \nand regional governance and policy. \n\n\u2022 Some contextual factors are fixed and hard to change \n(such as climate or geography), but others are dynamic \nand evolving (such as infrastructure and demographics). \nUnderstanding their natures and interrelationships within  \nan urban context can help prioritise policy and action. \n\n\u2022 City governments' sustainability visions and strategic \nplans are vital as foundations for further action. Coupled \nwith clear and measurable targets and committed \nleadership, they can play an important role in advancing \nambitious environmental goals. \n\n\u2022 EU laws and policy frameworks have a key role to play in \naccelerating sustainability changes in cities. City governments \nare strongly incentivised, supported and even inspired by EU \nlaws, standards, regulations and funding opportunities. \n\n\u2022 National and supranational governments can facilitate, as \nwell as inhibit, systemic change towards urban sustainability \ntransitions in cities. Some cities highlighted that a lack \nof alignment between local, national and supranational \npriorities and objectives can undermine progress. \n\n\u2022 Cities benefit from greater decision-making powers and \nfiscal autonomy, particularly when it comes to policy \nsectors that most acutely influence local sustainability \noutcomes. A lack of fiscal autonomy was repeatedly \nhighlighted as a barrier that constrains cities in accelerating \ntheir sustainability transitions. \n\n\u2022 Local research and experimentation can accelerate \ninnovation and is critical to identifying locally appropriate \nsolutions by using the city as a testbed for new ideas. \n\n\u2022 Involving various stakeholders and supporting effective \npublic engagement in decision-making processes leads \nto better sustainability outcomes. A sense of ownership \nand shared responsibility can help to create a common \nunderstanding of sustainability issues across various \ngovernment sectors and levels, as well as engage the \nprivate sector and communities. \n\n\u2022 Updated and accessible data and information are \nneeded to monitor progress. This leads to better \nenvironmental management and makes it easier to \ndemonstrate how a city is advancing towards specific \ngoals. \n\n\u2022 Accessing EU, national and private funding plays a \ncritical role in supporting cities' sustainability transitions. \nGovernments can accelerate systemic change by \nreorienting financial flows towards sustainable \ninvestments and by developing relevant knowledge \nsystems and skills to support them. \n\nFuture research opportunities\n\nA number of research needs and opportunities are identified, \nincluding applying the nexus approach at different levels, \nsuch as within cities, and at national and European levels; \nexpanding research on and analysis of drivers of urban \nsustainability to include more cities and explore specific \ntopics in more detail; using cities to test and experiment \nwith solutions to complex transition challenges, for example \nthrough EU and national research agendas; and developing \nnew measures of progress towards urban sustainability, \nincluding composite indicators and measures combining \nquantitative and qualitative evidence. \n\nAnother key opportunity is to localise the EEA-Eionet  \nstrategy 2021-2030 (EEA, 2021) through activities focused \non urban sustainability and in collaboration with urban \nstakeholders. This could valuably include co-creation with \ncities and their networks; integration with different levels of \ndecision-making; ensuring that research findings are available \nin time to inform policymaking; innovation by connecting \nwith citizen and industry data; equality and a focus on \nunderstanding winners and losers; and equipping cities  \nwith the capacity and skills they need to develop and work \nwith data and evidence. \n\f\n\u00a9 Harry Oliver, My City/EEA\n\f\n17Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n1\nIntroduction: from EU \n\nsustainability challenges  \nto cities as actors\n\nKey Messages\n\n\u2022 The EU sustainability perspective \u2014 overarching challenges and outlooks \u2014 The European environment \u2014 state \nand outlook 2020 highlights the scale and urgency of the challenges that Europe faces and the need for coordinated \naction, including the crucial role of cities in transitions. The United Nations affirms the role of cities with its \nnew urban agenda (Habitat III) and through Sustainable Development Goal 11. Major strategic EU policy stems \nfrom the European Green Deal and the Eighth Environment Action Programme \u2014 covering the period 2021-2030 \u2014 \ncontemplates EU action on the urban environment and needs to be articulated with the EU Urban Agenda. \n\n\u2022 The rise of the urban dimension \u2014 the past century and a half has seen a succession of competing or overlapping \nurban paradigms. Most recently, the EU is pursuing the European Green Deal roadmap and launched the 'New \nEuropean Bauhaus' in January 2021. The European Urban Initiative is an instrument to provide coherent support \nfor cities, a highly fragmented governance landscape while stakeholders rich. The responses to the COVID-19 \npandemic will have widespread impacts on people and economies across Europe, and the city level will be key  \nto a successful recovery. \n\n\u2022 The importance of focusing on cities \u2014 cities are at the centre of key environmental challenges, and there is an \nurgent need for European cities to shift towards a more integrated approach to addressing persistent, systemic \nenvironmental challenges, including developing resilience to a changing climate and improving the quality of life  \nof city residents. \n\n\u2022 Cities and the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 cities across Europe have been at the forefront of the impacts of and actions \nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response will be deeply intertwined with efforts to transition \ntowards environmental sustainability for years to come. \n\n\u2022 The EEA's interest in the urban environment in Europe \u2014 the role of cities in delivering on EU policymaking has \nbeen increasingly recognised and this, along with the environmental challenges cities face, has led the EEA to work \non understanding and assessing transitions to urban environmental sustainability drawing on a broad range of \nstakeholders. \n\n\u2022 The available knowledge base relevant to urban environmental sustainability \u2014 from a review of various \nsources, it is evident that there is an abundance of data on certain urban-related topics, while on others the data \nare more limited. The research highlights some of the challenges that relate to the information that is likely to be \navailable for assessing urban sustainability.\n\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n18 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n1.1 The EU sustainability perspective: \noverarching challenges and outlooks \n\nThe European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 \nreport (SOER 2020) (EEA, 2019a) stated that Europe faces \nenvironmental challenges of unprecedented scale and urgency. \nThis 5-yearly state of the environment report is positive in that \nEU environment and climate policies have delivered substantial \nbenefits over recent decades. Still, it highlights that Europe \nfaces persistent problems in areas such as biodiversity loss, \nresource use, climate change impacts and environmental risks \nto health and well-being. \n\nGlobal megatrends \u2014 global, long-term trends that are likely to \naffect the future of the world over the next 10-15 years \u2014 such \nas a growing, urbanising and migrating global population, are \ndriving change and intensifying many environmental challenges \nand bringing new risks and uncertainties. Diversifying values, \nlifestyles and governance approaches, worldwide climate \nchange and environmental degradation, increasing scarcity of \nand global competition for resources, and power shifts in the \nglobal economy and the geopolitical landscape, coupled with \naccelerating technological change and convergence, add to \nthe EEA's selected megatrends (1) that are driving change and \nalready having measurable impacts (Figure 1.1). \n\nSome European trends, specific to the continent, are in contrast \nto global trends, as is the case of the almost stagnating trend \nin the European urban population, while the evolution of \nproduction and consumption patterns will lead to emerging \ntrends that may evolve into bigger continental or global trends. \n\nAlthough the EU has committed to a range of long-term \nsustainability goals with the overall aim of 'living well,  \nwithin the limits of our planet' (Seventh Environment \nAction Programme to 2020 (2)), the SOER 2020 states that \nachieving these goals will not be possible without a rapid and \nfundamental shift in the character and ambition of Europe's \nresponses. It also states that the coming decade will be  \ndecisive in shaping the 21st century. \n\nEurope needs to rethink not only technological approaches and \nproduction processes but also consumption patterns and ways \n\nof living. Environment and climate pressures and health impacts \nrequire immediate and concerted action, engaging a diversity of \npolicy areas and a broad spectrum of actors across governance \nscales. \n\nAll the environmental and sustainability challenges that \nEurope faces today are rooted in interconnected global \ndevelopments stretching back over decades. During this \nperiod, a 'Great Acceleration' of social and economic \nactivity has transformed humanity's relationship with the \nenvironment (see Figure 1.2). This period is associated with \nincreasing prosperity, poverty alleviation and major positive \ntrends in health indicators in many parts of the world, \nincluding Europe. Yet these positive trends were paralleled \nwith consistent damage to ecosystems and erosion of \nbiodiversity. The impact of COVID-19 on these trends is yet to \nbe assessed.\n\nAs a pioneer of industrialisation and urbanisation, Europe \nplayed a pivotal role in shaping global changes. To meet \nits high consumption levels, Europe depends on resources \nextracted or used in other parts of the world, such as water, \nland, biomass and other materials. \n\nThese realities pose a profound challenge for Europe,  \nas the current trajectories of social and economic \ndevelopment are destroying the ecosystems that ultimately \nsustain life and humanity. Shifting onto truly sustainable \npathways will require rapid and large-scale transitions \nimplying reductions in environmental pressures, much \nbeyond what has been achieved so far. \n\nConsidering Europe's long-term vision (3) and corresponding \npolicy targets, it is clear that Europe is not making enough \nprogress in addressing environmental challenges. The \nmessages from the SOER 2020 assessment of recent \ntrends and outlooks is clear (4): policies have been more \neffective in reducing environmental pressures than in \nprotecting biodiversity and ecosystems or human health and \nwell-being. Despite the successes of European environmental \ngovernance, persistent problems remain, and the outlook \nfor Europe's environment in the coming decades is \ndisheartening (Figure\u00a01.3).\n\n(1)

\nenvironmental and sustainability challenges is that they are \ninextricably linked to economic activities and lifestyles, in \nparticular those that provide Europeans with necessities such \nas shelter, food, energy and mobility. \n\nAchieving the goals of the United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda  \nfor sustainable development and the Paris Agreement will \nrequire urgent action in each of these areas during the next\u00a010 \nyears. Sustainability needs to become the guiding principle \nfor ambitious and coherent policies and actions across \nsociety. For this to happen, sustainability principles have to be \nculturally, politically and institutionally ingrained at all scales of \ngovernance.  \n\nSociety is currently experiencing limits to its growth because  \nit is locked into defining growth in terms of economic activities  \nand material consumption. As emphasised by Commission  \nVice-President Frans Timmermans (EUdebates Team, 2021), \nhowever, the need for transformative change, amplified and \naccentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, calls for a profound \nrethinking of our activities in the light of sustainability. \n\nActing to collectively change these realities is a major challenge \nfor Europe and other world regions. SOER 2020 points to key \nenablers of change: cities, finance and knowledge. Of these \nthree cross-cutting enablers that stand out as having particular \nimportance in bringing about change, cities are mentioned as \ncrucial for transitions. \n\nAs almost 75 % of the EU's population lives in cities, supporting \nthe potential of cities and city networks is an imperative. Much \nof the production-consumption dynamic in Europe occurs in \nurban areas. The UN affirms the role of cities with its new urban \nagenda (Habitat III) (5) and through Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 11 (6) \u2014 'Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and \nsustainable'. In Europe, the EU's 2016 Pact of Amsterdam  \n(EC, 2016a) established the EU urban agenda. \n\nCities and towns are also the administrative level closest to \npeople, providing good settings for the engagement and \nparticipation of citizens, businesses and local governance in \nsocial innovation, cocreation, experimentation and learning. \nThey have the capacity to implement systemic change at local \nscales and to share ideas through city networks. Since the \nAalborg Charter of 1994 (7), inspired by the Rio Earth Summit's \nlocal agenda 21, cities have collaborated voluntarily, paving the \n\nway to the myriad of cities' networks, schemes and movements \nof today. \n\nSOER 2020 recognises the role of networks of cities and \nmentions some of the most prominent: the C40 (8) Climate \nLeadership Group, a network of global megacities and global \nactors on climate change; the International Council for Local \nEnvironmental Initiatives (ICLEI) (9), also known as Local \nGovernments for Sustainability, which is increasingly engaged \nwith systemic local sustainability transformations; and the \nglobal Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy (10), which \nfacilitates monitoring and sharing of best practices among \nmore than 7 000 cities worldwide (albeit primarily European) \nthat commit to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by \nat least 40 % by 2030. Others such as EuroCities (11) or the \nCouncil of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) (12) \nhave played a distinct role in Europe by providing a platform \nfor 190 major cities in 39 European countries or by being the \noldest association of local and regional governments in Europe \nsince\u00a01951, respectively. \n\nEU cities and towns vary in their intrinsic capacities and have \nfor decades required competent skill sets and resources to \npursue transformational approaches. European and national \nauthorities already have a long tradition of supporting urban \nexperimentation and fostering change through the Urbact (13) \nprogramme since 1989, aiming to achieve sustainable \nurban development through capacity building, policy design \nand implementation and knowledge building. Urbact is an \ninstrument of the cohesion policy, is co-financed by the \nEuropean Regional Development Fund and includes EU \nMembers States, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nIn late 2019, the current European Commission (2019-2024) \npresented the European Green Deal (EGD) (EC, 2019a), a \npolitical commitment setting out the main directions of \nfuture Commission action (Figure 1.4). For the first time the \nCommission put sustainability, environment and climate  \nat the forefront of all European policies as a means of  \neconomic and social transition.\n\nUnderstanding the EGD is important. Some call it visionary, \nothers revolutionary, as it proposes measures to run a modern \neconomy on net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But \nit is at the same time very familiar, as it will be put into practice \nthrough a very long list of recognisable goals from existing and \nwell-settled EU policies.\n\n(5) https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda\n(6) https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11\n(7) https://sustainablecities.eu/the-aalborg-charter\n(8) https://www.c40.org\n(9) https://iclei.org\n(10) https://www.covenantofmayors.eu/en\n(11) https://eurocities.eu\n(12) https://www.ccre.org\n(13) https://urbact.eu/urbact-glance\n\nhttps://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n24 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 1.1 Key areas for bold action from the 2020 state of the environment report\n\n\u2022 Enable transformative change across Europe \u2014 by harnessing the ambition, creativity and power of citizens, businesses \nand communities to shift towards sustainable production and consumption patterns and lifestyles that are socially fair.\n\n\u2022 Embrace the Sustainable Development Goals as an overarching framework for policymaking and implementation, at \nall scales, and complement them with additional measures if the goals could be more ambitious, for example on air \npollution and impacts on health.\n\n\u2022 Realise the unfulfilled potential of existing environmental policies \u2014 by achieving full implementation across Europe \nthrough increased funding, capacity building, stakeholder engagement and better coordination of local, regional and \nnational authorities.\n\n\u2022 Develop systemic policy frameworks with binding targets \u2014 to mobilise and guide actions across society (starting with \nthe food system and an integrated framework for environment and health).

The \nEGD couples this with encouragement to adopt 'nature-based \nsolutions' and to reduce resource consumption and waste. It \nproposes to reconceptualise how the future economy might \nlook. Such framing and ambition is probably what sets the EGD \napart in terms of policymaking, and its success (or not) will \naffect Europe and the rest of the world in the future.\n\nThe EGD presents a roadmap of actions to be rolled out \nin\u00a02020/21 containing a number of specific strategies and laws \nthat will implement it based on pre-existing policies and the \nbest available knowledge (Figure 1.5). Through the EGD, the EU \nreaffirms its commitments to the 2030 agenda for sustainable \ndevelopment. In fact, the SDGs are an intrinsic part of Ursula \nvon der Leyen's political agenda both internally and externally \nand across all sectors. \n\nThe COVID-19 wild card \u2014 a wild card (14) being a development \nthat may seem unlikely at present but could occur in the future \nand, if it does, is likely to bring about disruptive changes \u2014  \nthat hit the world early in 2020 has exposed the fragility of a  \nhyper-connected world. The knock-on effects are real, the damage \nto economies and societies being considerable. The stock markets \nwere affected, a low-demand oil market emerged, large sectors \u2014 \naviation, tourism destinations, conference centres and major \nevents \u2014 suffered, schools closed, and many businesses started \noperating from home. A global recession is inevitable.\n\nIn the face of the health crisis and ensuing economic and social \nemergency (when most countries re-opened after an initial \nperiod of lockdown), in mid-2020 the Commission presented \na new recovery instrument \u2014 NextGenerationEU (15) \u2014 \nembedded in a long-term EU budget, agreed at the end of 2020. \nThis temporary instrument, based on a recovery and resilience \nfacility, will constitute the largest and most ambitious stimulus \npackage ever financed through the EU budget.\n\nThe EGD played an important role in allocating priorities and \nfinancing major policies. These include the fight against climate \nchange, halting and reversing the decline in biodiversity, \nresearch and innovation and digital transformation. It also \ncontemplates the modernising of the 'big two' traditional \npolicies \u2014 cohesion and agriculture policies.\n\nTo benefit from the recovery and resilience facility's support, \nMember States were to prepare by April 2021 national recovery \nand resilience plans indicating the investments to be financed. \n\n(14) https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/sustainability-transitions/drivers-of-change\n(15) https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en#nextgenerationeu\n\nFigure 1.5 European Green Deal roadmap\n\n14 July 2021\nDelivering the European Green Deal\n\n17 May 2021\nSustainable blue economy\n\n17 May 2021\nZero pollution Action Plan\n\n25 March 2021\nOrganic Action Plan\n\n24 February 2021\nNew EU strategy on adaptation to climate change\n\n18 January 2021\nNew European Bauhaus\n\n10 December 2020\nEuropean Battery Alliance\n\n9 December 2020\nEuropean Climate Pact\n\n19 November 2020\nOffshore renewable energy\n\n14 October 2020\n\u2022 Renovation wave\n\u2022 Methane Strategy\n\u2022 Chemicals strategy for sustainability\n\n17 September 2020\nPresentation of the 2030 Climate Target Plan\n\n08 July 2020\nAdoption of the EU strategies for energy system \nintegration and hydrogen to pave the way towards \na fully decarbonised, more efficient and \ninterconnected energy sector\n\n20 May 2020\n\u2022 Presentation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030\n   to protect the fragile natural resources on our planet \n\u2022 Presentation of the \u2019Farm to fork strategy\u2019 to make \n   food systems more sustainable\n\n11 March 2020\nProposal of a Circular Economy Action Plan focusing \non sustainable resource use\n\n10 March 2020\nAdoption of the European Industrial Strategy, \na plan for a future-ready economy\n\n4 March 2020\n\u2022 Proposal for a European climate law to ensure\n   a climate neutral European Union by 2050\n\u2022 Public consultation (open until 17 June 2020) on the\n   European Climate Pact bringing together regions, local \n   communities, civil society, businesses and schools \n\n14 January 2020\nPresentation of the European Green Deal Investment \nPlan and the Just Transition Mechanism\n\n11 December 2019\nPresentation of the European Green Deal\n\nSource: EC (2021a).\n\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/sustainability-transitions/drivers-of-change\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n26 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThe European Commission encouraged Member States to \ninvolve local and regional authorities in their preparation. The \nEuropean Committee of the Regions (CoR) and the CEMR (16), \nbringing together thousands of European local and regional \nauthorities, considers this involvement extremely important, \nbut a jointly conducted and targeted consultation of national \nassociations of local and regional governments and authorities \nshows that this was not the case.\n\nThe CoR \u2014 supported by the European city umbrella \norganisations \u2014 advocates strongly for the 'Green Deal Going \nLocal' (17), placing cities and regions at the core of the EGD and \nensuring that direct funding for cities and regions contributes \nto territorial cohesion, the EU's sustainable growth strategy and \nthe COVID-19 recovery.\n\nIn October 2020 a major strategic policy stemming from \nthe European Green Deal roadmap was presented by the \nCommission \u2014 the Eighth Environment Action Programme \n(8th EAP) (18) \u2014 covering the period 2021-2030. The proposal \n'will complement the European Green Deal and will include a \nnew monitoring mechanism to ensure that Europe remains on \ntrack to meet its environmental objectives', while it reiterates \nthe commitment expressed in the 7th EAP's 2050 vision: ensure \nwell-being for all while staying within the planetary boundaries.\n\nThe 8th EAP proposal calls for active engagement of all \nstakeholders at all levels of governance. It is expected to be \nadopted in 2021. The 8th EAP contemplates EU action on \nthe urban environment through the European Green Capital \nAwards (EGCA) (19) and Green Leaf Awards (EGLA) and the  \nGreen City Accord (20).\n\n1.2 The rise of the urban dimension\n\nThe past century and a half has seen a succession of competing \nor overlapping urban paradigms \u2014 from the garden city of \nEbenezer Howard to the views of Le Corbusier and the Athens \nCharter and on to Christaller's theory of central places and \npolycentricity and Ian McHarg's precursor work on ecological \ndesign. All of these concepts revolved around shifting design \nmodels or geographical theories. All these and other models \nwere important in making the cities of today's Europe.\n\nLocal agenda 21, adopted in 1992 at the UN Rio Conference, \nbrought to the fore two other important elements of urban \ndevelopment: community participation and the formation of \npartnerships among local governments to pursue sustainable \ndevelopment, integrating environmental, social and economic \nconcerns.\n\n(16) https://cor.europa.eu/en/news/Pages/post-COVID-recovery-plans-.aspx\n(17) https://cor.europa.eu/en/engage/Pages/green-deal.aspx\n(18) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/environment-action-programme-2030_en#ecl-inpage-249\n(19) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital\n(20) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/urban-environment/green-city-accord_en\n(21) https://sustainablecities.eu/the-aalborg-charter\n(22) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/action-programme/env-act5/pdf/5eap.pdf\n\nCities and the urban dimension entered European policy \nagendas (still informally and voluntarily) with the Aalborg \nCharter (1994) (21), a follow up to the global local agenda\u00a021 \nmovement. This charter triggered the Sustainable Cities \nCampaign, a precursor of informal and voluntary city networks. \nThe 5th EAP \u2014 Towards sustainability (1993) (22) \u2014 addressed \nthe urban environment theme for the first time within an EU \nenvironment policy context.\n\nThe 6th EAP, adopted on 22 July 2002 as the framework for EU \nenvironmental policymaking for the period 2002-2012, identifies \nfour priority areas of concern: climate change, nature and \nbiodiversity, environment and health, and natural resources \nand waste. The 6th EAP intended to achieve full integration \nof environmental protection requirements in all Community \npolicies while building bridges between environmental \nobjectives and European objectives for growth, competitiveness \nand employment. \n\nThe 6th EAP calls for the development of seven thematic \nstrategies as a framework for action in the fields of soil and \nthe marine environment (in the priority area of biodiversity), \nair, pesticides and the urban environment (in the priority \narea of environment, health and quality of life) and natural \nresources and waste recycling (in the priority area of natural \nresources and waste). The 6th EAP is of strategic relevance, as \nit defined some integrated and cross-cutting approaches to \nmeeting environmental goals and set objectives and priority \nactions on international issues. The strategic approaches \ninclude the development of Community legislation and its \neffective implementation and enforcement; the integration of \nenvironmental protection requirements in other Community \npolicies; and the promotion of sustainable production \nand consumption patterns, improving collaboration with \nenterprises. Over a 10-year timeframe, rapid developments \nin climate change quickly overtook the 6th EAP's objectives \n(Homeyer, 2011a).\n\nNonetheless, a multitude of urban initiatives and  \nprogrammes under various EU directorates and presidencies \nemerged during the period of the 6th EAP, to name a few:  \nthe thematic strategy on the urban environment (EC, 2006); \nthe\u00a0urban dimension in the cohesion policy (Atkinson, 2014);  \nthe EU territorial agenda (EC, 2007a); and the Leipzig Charter  \n(EC, 2007b). They run in parallel, are rarely coordinated,  \nand seldom build on one another. Despite the existence  \nof integration initiatives such as the Commission \ncommunication 'Sustainable urban development in the \nEuropean Union: a framework for action' (EC, 1998), the \nsituation, apart from a greater general awareness, has  \nhardly changed for more than a decade.  \n\nhttps://cor.europa.eu/en/news/Pages/post-COVID-recovery-plans-.aspx\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n27Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nDecisions taken in many other non-urban and non-environmental \nEU policy areas also have major impacts on the situation in \ncities and towns and may even be contradictory; the same \ngoes for the national and regional levels. For example, the \ndevelopment of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) \nand the promotion of rural development through the common \nagricultural policy could \u2014 if they do not carefully consider \npossible negative side effects \u2014 result in urban sprawl at the \nlocal level (see EEA, 2009, pp. 24-25; EEA, 2010). Despite the \nneed for integration, cities have to fight hard to participate \nin European policymaking. For example, local actors had to \ninitiate the Local Government Climate roadmap in the run up \nto the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 15) to draw \nattention to the role cities can play in mitigating climate change \n(EEA, 2019a).\n\nThe 7th EAP \u2014 a general EU environment action programme \nto\u00a02020 \u2014explicitly addresses urban aspects and their \nrelevance. Horizontal objective 8 on sustainable cities is \n'Working together for common solutions'. It addresses the \nfollowing specific aspects: help cities become more sustainable; \npromote and expand initiatives that support innovation and \nsharing best practice in cities; and ensure that, by 2020, most \ncities in the EU are implementing policies for sustainable urban \nplanning and design, and are using the EU funding available for \nthis purpose.\n\nEvaluating the progress of the 7th EAP in the next steps towards \nan 8th EAP, the European Environmental Bureau (EEB, 2018) \nconcluded that environmental policies need to involve more \nlocal and regional stakeholders in policymaking at the EU level \nas a means of implementing the science-policy-stakeholder \ninterface. It also advises that the CoR and cities' associations,  \nas well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs), should  \nbe consistently involved so that their challenges are heard and \naddressed in a more systemic manner. Some priority actions \nat city level were highlighted: mobility systems, promotion of \ngreen spaces, resource efficiency and the circular economy, and \naccessibility to funds for local authorities and citizens' associations.\n\nThe same EEB evaluation recalls the need to ensure that the \nachievement of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development \nand the SDGs are fully integrated into the EU's internal and \nexternal policies ensuring policy coherence for sustainable \ndevelopment. While the EGD addresses this aspect Eurostat (23) \nreports yearly on Europe's progress towards achieving the \nobjectives of the 2030 agenda and its 17 SDGs, adopted by the \nUN General Assembly in September 2015. Using an indicator \nset comprising around 100 indicators \u2014 and short-term and \n\nlong-term trends \u2014 the report is structured along the 17 \nSDGs, focusing on the aspects that are relevant from an EU \nperspective. This includes SDG 11 (24) and its 10 specific targets, \nincluding:\n\n\u2022 by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental \nimpact of cities (air quality and waste); \n\n\u2022 by 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and \naccessible green and public spaces; \n\n\u2022 support positive economic, social and environmental links \nbetween urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening \nnational and regional development planning; \n\n\u2022 by 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and \nhuman settlements adopting and implementing integrated \npolicies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, \nmitigation of and adaptation to climate change, and \nresilience to disasters.\n\nSDG 11 can also be considered as an integrator of all the \nother sustainable development goals by virtue of expressing \na different scale of action rather than a specific thematic \nconcern (Figure 1.6). It embeds the importance of local \ncontexts in pursuing urban transitions within diverse thematic \nareas (Kabisch et al., 2019). This perspective was adopted by \nthe Pact of Amsterdam (EC, 2016a) \u2014 agreed on 30 May 2016 \n\u2014 that sets the basis for an urban agenda for the EU with the \nobjective of involving urban authorities in achieving better \nregulation, better funding and better knowledge.\n\nThe Pact of Amsterdam (EC, 2016a) arguably marked the \nstart of 'a new role-redefining phase for cities: one in which \ncities are no longer only the object of EU policy-making, but \nnow also become part of policy-making itself. Since then, \ncities got a \"seat at the table' of EU governance\".' (Potjer and \nHajer, 2017). The EU urban agenda (2016-2020) organised \n'partnerships' on various themes, in which cities, Member \nStates, the European Commission and other stakeholders \nworked together to discuss how EU policy can contribute \nto urban sustainability and governance. The innovative \nframework that emerged from the Pact of Amsterdam used \nan open method of coordination (European Parliament, 2014) \n\u2014\u00a0an EU policymaking process, formally initiated by the Lisbon \nEuropean Council in 2000 as a method of soft governance \nthat aims to spread best practice and achieve convergence \ntowards EU goals in specific policy areas while not resulting in \nEU legislation.\n\n(23) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/11011074/KS-02-20-202-EN-N.pdf/334a8cfe-636a-bb8a-294a73a052882f7f?t=1592994779000\n\n(24) https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/11011074/KS-02-20-202-EN-N.pdf/334a8cfe-636a-bb8a-294a-73a052882f7f?t=1592994779000\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n28 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nFigure 1.6 SDG 11 as the entry point to the SDGs, showing some of the connections between the SDGs\n\nSource: Kabisch et al. (2019).\n\nThe urban agenda aims to improve the accessibility, \ncoordination and simplification of the existing funding \npossibilities. According to the Pact of Amsterdam, voluntary \npartnerships are the key delivery mechanism within the urban \nagenda for the EU.

To address this, the European Investment \nBank created the Urban Investment and Advisory Platform \n(URBIS) (32), which provides financial and technical advisory \nservices for cities. To improve access to data, the Commission \n(DG REGIO and the Joint Research Centre) established the \nUrban Data Platform (33), bringing together for the first time  \nthe data available at EU level on key urban challenges  \n(e.g. housing, key pollutants or traffic) and providing key \nindicators, not only at city level but also for functional urban \nareas and metropolitan regions. This platform is a key element \nof the EU Knowledge Centre for Territorial Policies.\n\nThe European Urban Knowledge Network (34) report Ten years \nafter the Leipzig Charter (EUKN, 2017) concludes that more \nthan ever the urban dimension of EU policies is relevant in the \nlight of European structural policy after 2020. The adoption, \nunder the German Presidency of the Council of the European \nUnion, of the 'New Leipzig Charter' (35) by EU ministers in \nNovember\u00a02020 defines common principles for achieving \nthe vision of green, just and productive cities in the EU. Its \nimplementing document considers the urban agenda of the EU \nas the vehicle for the implementation of the charter.\n\nThe strong sustainable urban development dimension of cohesion \npolicy has been strengthened for the period 2021-2027. Cohesion \npolicy is at the heart of responding to urban sustainability \nchallenges in the EU \u2014 in terms of both funding and fostering \nplace-based, strategic, integrated, participatory and inclusive \napproach to addressing the sustainability challenges and \ntransitions of cities. In the period 2014-2020, around EUR 115 billion \nwas spent in cities, of which EUR 17 billion was managed locally \nby urban authorities through more than 950 integrated and \nsustainable urban development strategies. For the 2021-2027 \nperiod, the European Commission proposes a stronger urban  \nand territorial dimension by introducing a new policy objective, \n'Europe closer to citizens', supporting a place-based approach  \nand engaging local authorities, civil society and citizens in \ndelivering on local challenges. Furthermore, the Commission \nproposes the launch of a new European urban initiative (36) \nto support cities with capacity building, innovative solutions, \nknowledge, policy development and communication. The funds \nearmarked for sustainable urban development are also being \nincreased to 8 % of the total European Regional Development \nFund in each EU Member State.\n\n(31) https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/themes/urban-development/network\n(32) https://eiah.eib.org/about/initiative-urbis\n(33) https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/#/en\n(34) https://www.eukn.eu\n(35) https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/news/2020/12/12-08-2020-new-leipzig-charter-the-transformative-power-of-cities-for-the\ncommon-good\n(36) https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/brochure/explanatory_memo_eui_post_2020_en.pdf\n\nA century ago, the Bauhaus (literally 'Building House')  \nschool brought together artists and architects who challenged \northodoxy and developed a modernist thinking about housing \nat the city and state levels while pursuing interesting avenues \nin environmental thinking, such as passive solar energy and \necological gardening. Pursuing the EGD roadmap, in January 2021 \nthe European Commission in launched the 'New European \nBauhaus' \u2014 the Bauhaus reference interpreted as a metaphor \nfor innovative thinking and of design taking on everyday \nproblems \u2014 linked to the earlier 'Renovation wave', which was born \nout of a need to renovate and construct more energy-efficient \nbuildings. As building operations and construction together \naccount for 39 % of global greenhouse gas emissions  \n(WGBC, 2017), the proposal for energy retrofits is part of \nthe climate change mitigation actions at the core of the EU's \ncoronavirus recovery plan. The renovation wave will support \nthe goal of making Europe the world's first climate-neutral \ncontinent by 2050.\n\nThe original Bauhaus was neither a movement nor a style \nbut a school, a house of ideas and experimentation rather \nthan a policy influencer. Research, technology, nature and \nthe involvement of the right actors \u2014 the cities \u2014 will be \nparamount in the New European Bauhaus. To be fully \nsuccessful, any renovation wave will need to take into account \nthe local ecosystem, both social and natural.\n\nThe responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will have widespread \nimpacts on people and economies across Europe. The  \nimpetus for rapidly re-establishing economic growth and \nstability will need to realise synergies and manage trade-offs \nbetween climate change mitigation and wider well-being.  \nAlthough aligning policies over multiple different areas,  \nsuch as biodiversity, climate change and resource use, will  \nbe challenging, involving all possible actors, including those  \nat the city level, will be key to a successful recovery.\n\n1.3 Why focus on cities?\n\n1.3.1 The European context\n\nEurope is a highly urbanised continent: it is estimated that the \nshare of the EU population living in urban areas is currently 74 % \nand that this is predicted to rise to 80 % by 2050 (EEA, 2019a). \nHistorically, the urban population in Europe has been growing \nover the last half-century. Much of this growth has been in \ntowns and suburbs, especially in newly developed residential \nareas surrounding existing cities (Nabielek et al., 2016). \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/themes/urban-development/network/\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n30 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nHowever, since 2000 an increasing number of cities in European \ncountries (e.g. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, \nHungary, the Netherlands and Sweden) have had higher annual \npopulation growth in their urban cores than in their commuting \nzones (OECD, 2018; Salvati et al., 2019).\n\nThe urban landscape of Europe is characterised by a diversity of \nsmall, medium and large cities (Nabielek et al., 2016). There are \njust over 800 cities in the EU with more than 50 000 inhabitants \n(Heinelt, 2017). The majority of these, almost 700, are small and \nmedium-sized cities (between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) \n(Nabielek et al., 2016). At the other end of the scale, there are\u00a026 \ncities in the EU with a population of more than one million. \nOne in eight Europeans live in these largest cities (EC,\u00a02012). \nOf these cities, only Paris and London can be considered \nmegacities\u00a0\u2014\u00a0high-density metropolises of more than 10 million \ninhabitants (EC and UN-Habitat, 2016).\n\nEurope's varying urban structure is a product of many \nunderlying factors, including the historical development of \nsettlements, their location and geographical characteristics, \ntheir function, and various political, demographic and economic \ndevelopments. However, while overall Europe is highly \nurbanised there is both a high degree of heterogeneity among \nits cities and also varying levels of urbanisation from country \nto country. Many urban regions have many towns and cities \nin close proximity \u2014 a polycentric structure \u2014 while others \nare characterised by a single large city, often the capital city, \ndominating its surroundings \u2014 a monocentric structure.  \nThere are also some examples of a more linear urban pattern, \nfor example along the Mediterranean and Adriatic coasts  \n(Nabielek et al., 2016).\n\nIn general, western and northern Europe are more urbanised \nthan the rest of Europe. The most urbanised region of Europe \nis an area forming a pentagon with its apexes in London, Paris, \nMilan, Munich and Hamburg. In countries such as Belgium, \nGermany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, more \nthan three quarters of the population lives in urban areas. In \ncontrast, other countries, such as Poland, Romania, Slovakia \nand Slovenia, are less urbanised, with more than 40 % of the \npopulation living in rural areas (Nabielek et al., 2016).\n\nThe urban environmental challenge\n\nEuropeans have adopted an urban lifestyle partly to benefit \nfrom the amenities that cities provide, such as cultural, \neducational and health services, as well as the economic \nopportunities cities offer as the engines of Europe's economy. \nHowever, cities do not operate in isolation: they rely on the \nregions outside the city to meet their demand for resources, \nsuch as energy, water and food, and to dispose of and disperse \nwaste and emissions (EEA, 2017a).\n\nThis context poses a significant challenge: how to accommodate \neven greater numbers of people in urban areas while reducing \nthe impact on the environment and being resilient to a changing \nclimate, and at the same time improving the quality of life of city \nresidents. Meeting this challenge and achieving the objective \nof urban sustainability \u2014 i.e. efficient and smartly planned, \ndesigned, renovated, managed and governed cities\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is likely \nto require a radical transformation of the current model of \nurban development and a more people-oriented approach \n(EEA,\u00a02017a).\n\nSome of the main environmental challenges facing European \ncities include the emissions they produce, levels of air and \nnoise pollution, increasing energy use and the consumption \nof water and materials, land take and habitat fragmentation \n(see Table 1.1 which includes examples of the challenges cities \nface). Urban areas are major consumers of energy and account \nfor\u00a060-80 % of global energy consumption (UN-Habitat, 2019). \nThe consumption of water varies considerably across European \ncities, from an average consumption in Madrid of 263 litres per \nperson per day and 164 litres per day in London to 100 litres \nper day in Copenhagen (Carranza and Bueno, 2018; Greater \nLondon Authority, 2020; IWA, 2020). On average, households \nacross European cities use nearly three times the amount \nof water (144 litres per person per day) than the minimum \nrequired for basic human needs (50 litres per person per day) \n(EEA, 2018a).\n\nAlthough emissions of air pollutants have declined in recent \nyears, almost 20 % of the EU's urban population lives in \nareas where air pollutant concentrations exceed at least one \nEU air quality standard (e.g. PM2.5 (fine particulate matter), \nPM10 (particulate matter), O3 (ozone), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)) \n(EEA,\u00a02019a). Urban areas are also responsible for at least 70 % \nof global carbon emissions (EEA, 2019b).\n\nAs a result of land take, urban areas may severely hamper \necosystem functioning and the related delivery of ecosystem \nservices (EEA, 2016a). The increase in land take for urban \ndevelopment is an ongoing process across Europe, with \nthe total urban area expanding by approximately 6.7 % \nbetween\u00a02000 and 2018 at the expense of agricultural and \nsemi-natural areas. Urban areas consumed 0.6 % of all arable \nland and permanent crops, 0.5 % of all pastures and mosaic \nfarmland, and 0.3 % of all grasslands. In the EU-27 and the UK, \nbetween 2000 and 2018 urban sprawl converted 0.5 % of all \npastures and mosaic farmland and 0.3 % of all grasslands into \nartificial surfaces (EEA, 2016b).\n\nCities are at the centre of future environmental challenges,  \nand therefore there is an urgent need for European cities \nto shift towards a more integrated approach to addressing \npersistent, systemic environmental challenges.  \n\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n31Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThe EU has a key role in promoting sustainable urban \ndevelopment; however, it is city administrations that are likely \nto be best placed to take local action to tackle and resolve \nmany of these issues (EEA, 2017a). They are crucial in improving \nwaste and water management, public transport and efficient \nuse of land by implementing integrated urban planning \n(EEA, 2015). Furthermore, city networks and associations are \nbecoming increasingly important in shaping global climate and \nsustainability agreements (EEA, 2020a).\n\nDespite the central role of urban authorities, they cannot tackle \nthe complex challenges of urban sustainability transitions \nwithout the support of regional, national and supranational \ngovernments. Alongside this need for multi-level governance \nacross the traditional structures of government, there is also \n\na recognition that the governance of transitions requires a \nredrawing of the boundaries between the state and society \n(Ehnert et al., 2018). This does not mean that government \ninstitutions do not continue to play an important role, but \nrather that effective governance of complex sustainability issues \nrelies on collaboration with stakeholders from science, business \nand society (EEA and Eionet, 2016).\n\nEuropean citizens are deeply concerned about climate change \nand the environment and believe that their actions towards \nenvironmental protection matter (EC, 2017a). This enables more \nproactive involvement of EU institutions and Member States in \nenvironmental matters and stronger engagement and support \nof citizens and local stakeholders for measures taken by the EU \nand national governments (EEA, 2019a).\n\nTable 1.1 Examples of potential challenges facing cities \n\nEnvironmental challenges Other challenges with environmental implications or that \ncan increase vulnerability to environmental challenges \n\n\u2022 Heat waves\n\n\u2022 Sea level rise\n\n\u2022 Severe storms and flooding\n\n\u2022 Water consumption and shortages/droughts\n\n\u2022 Forest fires\n\n\u2022 Air pollution\n\n\u2022 Water pollution\n\n\u2022 Ground contamination\n\n\u2022 Noise pollution\n\n\u2022 Light pollution\n\n\u2022 Energy consumption and shortages\n\n\u2022 Clean drinking water\n\n\u2022 Timber, mineral and other natural resource and \nmaterial consumption and shortages\n\n\u2022 Land/soil erosion\n\n\u2022 Food shortages/access to food\n\n\u2022 Solid waste processing\n\n\u2022 Solid waste disposal\n\n\u2022 Sewage treatment and disposal\n\n\u2022 Stormwater management\n\n\u2022 Habitat fragmentation\n\n\u2022 Decline of native species/natural habitats\n\n\u2022 Land take\n\n\u2022 Lack/loss of green space\n\n\u2022 Lack/loss of ecologically productive land\n\n\u2022 Urban sprawl\n\n\u2022 Overcrowding and population density\n\n\u2022 Inadequate or absent infrastructure\n\n\u2022 Community severance (a physical and psychological \nbarrier created by, for example, roads or rail \ninfrastructure)\n\n\u2022 Road congestion\n\n\u2022 Social exclusion and inequality\n\n\u2022 Unemployment rates\n\n\u2022 Lack of affordable housing\n\n\u2022 Insufficient public services\n\n\u2022 Non-communicable diseases (e.g. heart disease, cancer, \nasthma, diabetes)\n\n\u2022 Poor mental health\n\n\u2022 Demographic change\n\n\u2022 Health pandemics \n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n32 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThe role of cities\n\nThe influence of cities in EU policymaking has been increasingly \nrecognised over the last few decades, including through the \nestablishment of the European CoR in 1994 and the signing \nof the Leipzig Charter in 2007 and culminating in the urban \nagenda for the EU, established as the Pact of Amsterdam, in May \n2016. In 2020 the EU ministers responsible for urban matters \nagreed on a new, refocused Leipzig Charter supplemented by \nan 'implementing document' to envisage and realise the recent \nEuropean and global agreements on sustainability (e.g. EGD, \nurban agenda for the EU, Paris Agreement) at the urban scale. \nWhile cities do not have a formal role in decision-making at the \nEU level, municipal administrations can influence decisions, \nas they are a key source of expertise and offer legitimacy to \nthe EU given their proximity to citizens. Once EU legislation is \ntransposed into Member State law, cities often have a key role \nin its implementation, particularly as many individual countries \nin the EU have granted cities and regions constitutional powers \nof self-governance. Cities also often control significant budgets, \nand municipal administrations represent an important part of the \n'state-at-work' in many EU Member States (Heinelt, 2017).\n\nIn parallel with this increasing recognition of the role of cities \nin Europe, and not unconnected, has been a trend towards \nstrengthening urban governance. This has been coupled with an \nexpansion of a range of networks, organisations and initiatives \nacross European cities and their metropolitan areas (JRC, 2020), \nsuch as EuroCities and ICLEI Europe. There has also been an \nincreasing commitment from European cities on the global stage \nworking through large networks, such as United Cities and Local \nGovernments, Metropolis, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership \nGroup, and the Global Covenant of Mayors, and given an extra \nmomentum and focus by the SDGs and their implementation \n\u2014 SDG 11 in particular. For example, many local governments \nin Europe have made a political commitment to climate change \nadaptation by joining international initiatives, with over a quarter \nof the population in the 38 EEA member and collaborating \ncountries living in local authorities committed to adaptation under \nthe Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy (EEA, 2020b). This is \nempowering cities, facilitating greater cooperation and knowledge \nexchange, and has accelerated the demand for the devolution of \nfiscal, political, and administrative powers and responsibilities to \ncities from central governments (JRC, 2020).\n\nTaking the example of adaptation to climate change, by \nfollowing the 2013 EU strategy Member States have recognised \nthe importance of adaptation in the urban context and many \nidentify local governments as the implementers of adaptation \n(EEA, 2020b). Local-level adaptation planning or climate change \nrisk assessments are mandatory in some countries and several \nhundred cities have benefited so far from EU funding for \nadaptation-related research, knowledge exchange, and the \nplanning and implementation of measures. Many cities have \norganised their own mutual support and knowledge sharing \nthrough networks at the international, national or regional level \n(EEA, 2020b).\n\n1.3.2 COVID-19 and environmental sustainability in \ncities\n\nCities across Europe have been at the forefront of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic from the very beginning of the health \ncrisis, bearing some of the worst impacts. The pandemic \nhas had many wide-ranging impacts on how cities operate \nand is likely to remain deeply intertwined with efforts to \ntransition towards environmental sustainability for years to \ncome. Cities have also become essential actors in proactively \nand innovatively addressing the public health emergency, \nas well as in dealing with the wider social and economic \nramifications. At the same time, many innovative actions \nand policies intended to deal with the health emergency also \nhave potential long-term environmental benefits, such as \nan improved active travel infrastructure. There is a growing \nmovement of cities in Europe actively committing to a green \nrecovery from the crisis \u2014 supported by initiatives at the EU \nlevel such as the EGD.\n\nWhen it comes to cultural and behavioural shifts, uncertainties \nexist \u2014 while people may be more attuned to the importance \nof clean air and high-quality green spaces, whether this \ntranslates into more permanent pro-environmental \nbehaviours and how we develop and plan our cities is still \nunclear. As such, it remains to be seen what the long-term \nimpacts on the sustainability transition in cities will be. It is \nalso clear that city, national and EU budgets will be under \neconomic strain as a result of the pandemic, which may result \nin reduced budgets for core environmental initiatives in the \nyears ahead.\n\nAs the pandemic is still ongoing and its duration is uncertain, \nthe overall implications of the responses to it on the \ntransition towards urban environmental sustainability and \nEU environmental sustainability goals are unclear. The way \nthat the EU and European countries have responded to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has had impacts on all aspects of life. \nThis includes implications in cities and for a range of urban \nsystems, such as the mobility, food and energy systems.  \nThe wide range of impacts has meant that the pandemic has \nexacerbated some of the existing challenges that cities face, \nwhereas others have proved environmentally beneficial, or \nhave opened up debates about urban environmental and \nsocial issues and political space to explore positive change.  \nFor example, lockdowns in cities highlighted the value of \nhaving access to green space for physical and mental  \nwell-being, and the inequalities in this access, especially for \nthose who do not have access to private green and outdoor \nspaces (e.g. gardens). The nature of the impacts also appears \nto vary over time, and for different types and sizes of cities.\n\n1.3.3 The EEA's activities on the urban environment\n\nThe EEA regularly assesses the urban environment in  \nEurope \u2014 for example, assessing the trends in land take  \n\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n33Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nand consumption and environmental quality. SOER 2020, \npublished at the end of 2019, creates a new mandate for  \nthe EEA to work at the urban level. While the main conclusions  \nare targeted at the broader country and institutional level,  \nthey nonetheless express (directly or indirectly) the relevance  \nof other scales of action such as cities. The report clearly \npresents the need for urgent action in several key areas and \naffirms the need for 'enabling transformative change (that)  \nwill require that all areas and levels of government work \ntogether and harness the ambition, creativity and power  \nof citizens, businesses and communities'.\n\nSOER 2020 builds on SOER 2015, which concluded that  \n'Living well within environmental limits will require  \nfundamental transitions in core societal systems, including  \nfood, energy, mobility, urban, fiscal and finance systems.  \nTo achieve such purpose profound changes in dominant \npractices, policies and thinking are needed.' This will require \nfundamental transitions in core societal systems, including  \nthe urban system, and this will necessitate profound changes  \nin dominant practices, policies and thinking.\n\nIn recent years the EEA has produced a range of outputs  \n(e.g. reports, tools and online repositories) that provide \nindicators and case studies at the EU city level and at \nthe national/regional level. These cover a range of urban \nenvironmental topics including climate, air and noise pollution, \nresource use, energy and transport. A summary of key recent \nEEA activities on urban environmental sustainability  \nis presented in Table 1.2.\n\nIt is within this context, and in recognition of the fact that \nEuropean cities need to be more sustainable, that over recent \nyears the EEA has focused on gathering more knowledge in the \nfield of urban sustainability. This has led to the development \nof a conceptual framework, in consultation with and using \ninput from external stakeholders, to support the analysis of the \n\nEEA's future assessments. This framework, along with some \ninitial assessments of urban environmental sustainability, is \npresented in Chapter 2 of this report.\n\nScope and focus\n\nThe EEA's work on urban sustainability is framed in terms of its \ncore environmental sustainability remit. The work is therefore \nnot trying to capture the breadth of all the economic, social \nand environmental dimensions of urban sustainability, but \ninstead it concentrates on the EEA's environmental perspective \non urban sustainability. However, the need to break out of \nseparate 'economic', 'social' and 'environment' silos is reflected \nin EU policy initiatives such as the 7th EAP, EU biodiversity \nstrategy for 2030 (EC, 2020a) and the EGD (EC, 2019a). \nThe\u00a07th\u00a0EAP, for example, has an explicit focus on improving \nthe environment, in order to benefit health and well-being, and \ncreating a resource-efficient, green and competitive low-carbon \neconomy (EU, 2013). The EGD emphasises the need for \n'intense coordination to exploit the available synergies across \nall policy areas' to address the complex and interlinked social, \nenvironmental and economic challenges (EC, 2019a). The EEA is \ntherefore interested in questions that touch on the breadth of \nsustainability, but from a clear environmental perspective \u2014 for \nexample, will air pollution be a more serious issue for a larger \nelderly urban population? And what impact will climate change \nhave on the key infrastructure and assets upon which the \neconomies of cities depend?\n\nStakeholder input\n\nRecognising the transversal and complex nature of urban \nsustainability research and practice, in 2017 the EEA launched \na work stream on understanding and assessing urban \nenvironmental sustainability.

This principally focused on \nthose sources where data and indicators and examples are \n\nmanaged or owned by relevant pan-European agencies  \n(e.g. Eurostat, European Commission) and updated frequently. \nOther sources, including from external European and \ninternational organisations and initiatives, as well as numerous \nacademic and peer-reviewed research papers, were also \nconsidered (see Table 1.3) and used as part of the analysis  \nof nexuses and barriers to and drivers of urban environmental \nsustainability (see Chapters 3 and 4, respectively).\n\nTable 1.3 Overview of sources relevant to urban environmental sustainability and their scope \n\nType of source Summary of data/indicators/examples \navailable Examples of key sources \n\nEuropean \nCommission \nsources  \n(e.g. Eurostat, \nHorizon 2020 \nprojects)\n\nThe various European Commission sources \nprovide indicators and case studies at the EU \ncity level as well as at national or international \nlevel. These sources provide a range of both \nqualitative and quantitative information that \nvaries in spatial scope (i.e. size of cities covered) \nas well as thematic areas (socio-economic, \nland use, climate, environmental, resource \nuse, technology/innovation and transport). \nThe Eurostat sources in particular provide \nindicators for urban settings across various \ntopics, including quality of life, noise pollution, \nair quality, housing, waste water treatment, \neconomic activity, water consumption and waste \nproduction  \nand land use.\n\n\u2022 Eurostat urban audit (a)\n\n\u2022 Eurostat quality of life indicators (b)\n\n\u2022 The European Green City Index (c)\n\n\u2022 Urbact good practices database (d)\n\n\u2022 The urban data platform (e)\n\n\u2022 European Green Capital Award (f)\n\n\u2022 European Green Leaf Award (g)\n\n\u2022 Reference Framework for Sustainable Cities (h)\n\n\u2022 The urban agenda partnerships (i)\n\n\u2022 Eurobarometer survey 419: Quality of life in European cities (j)\n\n\u2022 The Green City Accord \n\nSources from \nexternal \nEuropean \norganisations \nand initiatives \non sustainable \ndevelopment \n(e.g. Covenant \nof Mayors, ICLEI, \nUN)\n\nThe various reports, tools and online repositories \nprovide indicators and case studies on EU cities \nacross various topics, including governance, \nengagement, social dimension, land use, \nresilience, resource use, climate, environment, \nhealth, biodiversity, energy and transport.\n\n\u2022 OECD Resilient Cities project (k)\n\n\u2022 The Urban Adaptation Support Tool \u2014 Covenant of Mayors (l)\n\n\u2022 Oppla nature-based solutions \u2014 city case studies providing \nexamples of the multiple benefits delivered  \nby nature-based solutions (m)\n\n\u2022 World Health Organization report \u2014 Environmental health \ninequalities in Europe (n)\n\n\u2022 Convention on Biological Diversity \u2014 the City Biodiversity Index (o)\n\n\u2022 ICLEI/WWF One Planet City Challenge (p)\n\n\u2022 IEA reports (e.g. IEA Energy technology perspectives 2017) (q)\n\nNotes: (a) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/data/database \n(b) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Quality_of_life_indicators \n(c) https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:fddc99e7-5907-49aa-92c4-610c0801659e/european-green-city-index.pdf \n(d) https://urbact.eu/good-practices/home \n(e) https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/#/en \n(f) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital \n(g) https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/europeangreenleaf \n(h) http://rfsc.eu \n(i) https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/themes/urban-development/agenda \n(j) https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/S2070_419_ENG ; https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/urban-environment/green-city-accord_en \n(k) https://www.oecd.org/fr/gov/politique-regionale/resilient-cities.htm \n(l) https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/knowledge/tools/urban-ast/step-0-0 \n(m) https://oppla.eu/nbs/case-studies \n(n) https://www.euro.who.int/en/publications/abstracts/environmental-health-inequalities-in-europe.-second-assessment-report-2019 \n(o) https://www.cbd.int/subnational/partners-and-initiatives/city-biodiversity-index \n(p) https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/our_focus/projects/one_planet_cities/one_planet_city_challenge \n(q) https://www.iea.org/analysis\n\n IEA, International Energy Authority; OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; Oppla, the EU repository of \nnature-based solutions; WWF, World Wide Fund for Nature.\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/data/database\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n37Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nFrom the review of sources, it is evident that there is an \nabundance of quantitative data on the environmental quality, \nland use, biodiversity and resilience thematic areas in an urban \ncontext. For example, urban land use is distinguished as a \nspecific topic in several of the sources reviewed such as the \nCopernicus Urban Atlas, which provides data on green urban \nareas. Other topics with readily available data or indicators and \nexamples are for climate change adaptation, transport and \nenergy. A key source of case studies on climate adaptation is \nthe Climate-ADAPT platform (37). The sources of information \nidentified from the review also suggest that there is a good \nrepresentation of case studies for some topics such as \nstakeholder engagement and community initiatives.\n\nIn contrast, in some thematic areas, such as urban agriculture \nand food systems, there are more limited sources of data or \nindicators and examples. Considering their broad scope, these \ntopic areas do not have a unique source, data set or indicator \nthat would provide sufficient information for the purposes of a \ncomprehensive assessment of urban sustainability. Therefore, \nit is likely to be necessary to draw on a selection of multiple \nsources of data or indicators and examples to provide the \nevidence on certain thematic areas. Another common issue \namong various sources of data and indicators is that the scale is \nincompatible with the required urban focus. Across the sources \nthere are indicators and data that fit within a specific thematic \narea; however, they are not necessarily available specifically \nfor urban areas or for common boundaries, thus currently \nlimiting their utility in the assessment of urban environmental \nsustainability.\n\nIt is important to note that some topics would benefit from \nthe application of both qualitative and quantitative evidence. \nFor example, assessing the quality of life aspects in urban \nenvironments through quantitative indicators that look at \nthe physical environment will not provide a comprehensive \ncharacterisation of this issue. Improving the quality of the \nenvironment by itself does not improve the quality of life of \nindividuals. Furthermore, 'good-quality' public space is not an \nobjective issue. It will mean different things to different people.\n\nThe review also highlights some of the challenges in \nterms of the information likely to be available for urban \nsustainability assessment. These include infrequent updates \nand lack of standardisation of cross-country data for cities, \nresulting in limited comparability, which is acknowledged by \nEurostat (Eurostat, 2020a). This is also affected by the lack \nof a consistent use of definitions between data sources. For \nexample, the data in Eurostat's urban audit (Eurostat, 2020b) \napplies the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment-European Commission (OECD-EC) definition of a \ncity (EC, 2012).  \n\n(37) https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\n\nIn contrast, the Urban Ecosystem Europe (UEE) report \nintroduces urban indicators categorised into six \ndifferent themes and applied in 32 EU cities of various \nsizes \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0metropolitan areas, big cities, medium-sized cities and  \nmedium-small cities (Berrini and Bono, 2008; EC, 2015a).\n\n1.5 The report structure\n\nChapter 2 explores the complexity of urban systems and what \nfactors may influence the transition to urban environmental \nsustainability. A conceptual framework for urban environmental \nsustainability is presented, focusing on the EEA's remit. This \nframework enables a consistent approach to the analysis and \nassessment of urban environmental sustainability. The chapter \noutlines examples of different forms of analysis of urban \nenvironmental sustainability that may help decision-makers  \nto identify policy options and prioritise forms of analysis.\n\nChapter 3 introduces the nexus approach and its application \nwithin an urban context. The nexus approach and nexus \nanalysis help us to understand complex systems and identify \nbetter coordinated policies and actions to support urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Eight priority urban sustainability \nnexuses are presented focusing on climate resilience; quality of \nlife; urban accessibility; environment and health; food security; \nclosing the loop; clean energy; and sustainable buildings. Key \npolicy and governance implications from the nexus analysis  \nare presented.\n\nChapter 4 presents the results of research on the experience \nof pioneering cities in the transition to urban environmental \nsustainability. This seeks to improve the understanding of \nthe drivers of change that can either enable or hinder urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions in European cities. \nThe analysis was based on a mixed methods approach that \ncombined a literature review, a survey and semi-structured \ninterviews. It focused on frontrunner cities that have either won \nor been selected as finalists in the EGCA or the EGLA.\n\nChapter 5 presents key messages on the implications for \nthe EU arising from this review of urban environmental \nsustainability. This brings together information and evidence \non the importance and role of cities and urban areas in \ndelivering the EU's sustainability transition; the support for \nurban environmental sustainability in Europe; how urban \nenvironmental sustainability can be analysed and assessed and \nlessons from the two approaches presented in the report (the \nanalysis of the selected urban nexuses; and an assessment of \ndrivers and barriers in cities); key messages for policy and urban \ngovernance; and further research needs.\n\nhttps://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/\f\nIntroduction: from EU sustainability challenges to cities as actors\n\n38 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change \u00a9 Josef Hinterleitner, My City/EEA\n\f\n39Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n2\nUrban environmental \n\nsustainability: a framework\n\nKey Messages\n\n\u2022 Cities need to address systemic challenges and opportunities \u2014 many systemic social, environmental and \neconomic challenges are concentrated in urban areas. At the same time, cities and city authorities are well placed \nto develop and implement the integrated solutions that the transitions to a low-carbon, resilient, resource-efficient \neconomy requires.\n\n\u2022 Defining urban environmental sustainability \u2014 overall, urban environmental sustainability is intended to be a \nbroad concept for the foundation of future cities that captures the breadth of the EEA's interests.\n\n\u2022 The conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability will help provide a clear structure for the EEA's \nthinking on urban environmental sustainability assessments, including in terms of:\n\n\u2022 the key components and outcomes that should define a vision of environmental sustainability in an urban context \nin Europe; and\n\n\u2022 the components required to support the transition of European cities to a more sustainable future, particularly \nfocusing on urban environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 The conceptual framework is based on four main components:\n\n\u2022 Lenses \u2014 a range of perspectives on urban environmental sustainability that represent priority issues or concerns \nreflecting the EEA's environmental remit and that can be used to guide and focus assessment and analysis.\n\n\u2022 Context \u2014 the range of current and historical physical, social and institutional characteristics that create and shape \nthe setting in which a specific city exists, develops and functions. The context has a considerable influence on the \ntransition to urban environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Enabling factors \u2014 relatively high-level forces that can facilitate (drivers) or hinder (barriers) the transition to \nurban environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Building blocks \u2014 key qualities that contribute to urban environmental sustainability. Depending on the context \nand enabling factors, different building blocks will be required to transition towards urban environmental \nsustainability.\n\n\u2022 Operationalising the conceptual framework \u2014 the conceptual framework can be applied in different ways to support \nthe analysis of cities from the perspective of environmental sustainability. There are various forms of analysis that could \nbe undertaken as part of assessing the current status quo or transition options for urban environmental sustainability.\n\f\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework\n\n40 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n2.1 Cities as complex systems\n\nMany systemic social, environmental and economic challenges \nare concentrated in urban areas. Yet cities can also help provide \nsolutions to these challenges. As well as being economically \nimportant, and being home to almost three quarters of \nEuropean citizens, cities are 'hubs of creativity, innovation and \nlearning' that are 'crucial for transitions \u2026 with the capacity \nto effect systemic change at local scales and to share ideas \nthrough city networks' (EEA, 2019a). Urban areas also face \nparticular vulnerabilities that necessitate transformative \nadaptation (EEA, 2019a, 2020b). Cities and city authorities are \nwell placed to develop and implement the integrated solutions \nthat the transition to a low-carbon, resilient, resource-efficient \neconomy requires.\n\nCities can be seen as 'distinct systems that can be transformed' \n(EEA, 2019a), and within cities are nested interconnected \nproduction and consumption sub-systems such as those for \nenergy, food and mobility. Cities are, as a result, frequently \nconceptualised as complex systems that are unpredictable \nand dynamic. Urban sub-systems interact in bilateral and \nmultilateral positive (i.e. reinforcing) and negative (i.e. conflicting) \nways (Rode, 2019). These interactions lead to a range of \noutcomes for urban residents, the environment and the \neconomy. These include intended outcomes, such as access \nto employment and services, sufficient and affordable food, or \nreliable energy supplies. However, there will also be negative \nimpacts and interactions between the systems, for example \nair and noise pollution from traffic, and damage to or loss of \nhabitats and green space from infrastructure development. \nIndeed, many urban problems arise as a direct result of \nthe disregard, by policymakers and planners, of conflicting \nrelationships between urban sub-systems (Rode, 2019).\n\nCities also depend on their hinterlands and on national and \ninternational connections for food, water, energy and other \nsupplies. People, resources and goods flow in and out of cities, \nand, through the activities happening in cities, waste and \npollution (e.g. to air and water) is dispersed within and beyond \ncity boundaries.\n\nCities and urban authorities in the EU often control significant \nbudgets (Heinelt, 2017) and can set all or some of their own \npolicy and strategy. They have responsibility for local services \nsuch as water, mobility, energy and waste. It is increasingly \nrecognised that 'cities are key players in implementing the \nEU's goals in terms of a low-carbon economy \u2026 and resource \nefficiency. They are crucial in improving waste management, \npublic transport, water management and, through integrated \nurban planning, the efficient use of land.' (EEA, 2019a). However, \ngiven the complex nature of urban systems, decision-makers \nin cities and urban authorities 'require strategies to embrace \ncomplexity and analytical devices to better understand the \nproblems and develop courses of action' (Rode, 2019).\n\n2.2 What is the EEA's conceptual framework for \nurban environmental sustainability?\n\n2.2.1 Defining urban environmental sustainability\n\nAlthough there is no single agreed definition of urban \nsustainability, or of what a sustainable city might look like, there \nis broad agreement on what contributes to urban sustainability. \nThe World Urban Forum affirmed in 2002 that the creation \nof sustainable cities required addressing economic, social, \nenvironmental and governance issues in an integrated way  \n(UN-Habitat and DFID, 2002). More recently, SDG 11 \u2014 make \ncities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable \u2014 seeks to maintain \ncities in a way that continues to create jobs and prosperity \nwithout straining land and resources (UN, 2020). This includes \nthe sustainability of the linkages between cities and their rural \nhinterland as well as natural areas, both terrestrial and marine.\n\nReflecting the EEA's mandate to help the EU and the EEA \nmember and cooperating countries make informed decisions \nabout improving the environment, integrating environmental \nconsiderations into economic policies and moving towards \nsustainability, the focus of this report is on urban sustainability \nfrom an environmental perspective. The EEA's approach to \nurban environmental sustainability acknowledges that social \nand economic dimensions are important, but focuses primarily \non environmental issues in urban areas. These include, for \nexample, air and water pollution, green spaces providing space \nfor people and nature, biodiversity loss, resource efficiency, and \nmitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nmanage the impacts of climate change. Such environmental \nissues also underpin and support the social and economic \nhealth of cities, and, as noted in Section 2.1, cities can be seen as \ncomplex systems in which all elements of sustainability interact.\n\nThe initial approaches and assessments presented in this report \nalso consider the interactions between policy areas in moving \ntowards urban environmental sustainability. The systemic \ninterlinkages between environmental sustainability and broader \nsustainability are therefore explicitly recognised and considered \nin the conceptual framework and related assessments. This \nis in line with the EEA's focus on sustainability transitions, \nwhich reflect the need for fundamental change in core societal \nsystems (EEA, 2019f).\n\nOverall, urban environmental sustainability is intended to be a \nbroad concept. It is the EEA's preferred term for capturing the \nbreadth of its interests. As a foundation for future cities, it is a \nterm that includes encouraging revitalisation and transitions \nof urban areas and cities to improve liveability, promote \ninnovation and reduce environmental impacts while maximising \neconomic and social co-benefits. Urban environmental \nsustainability is likely to be reflected in the extent to which the \nfollowing characteristics are seen or can be developed in cities \n(Moir et al., 2014; EBRD, 2016; GPSC, World Bank, 2018):\n\f\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework\n\n41Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n\u2022 a relatively compact and densely populated mixed use \nurban form that creates efficiency gains;\n\n\u2022 a secure and healthy urban environment where both \npeople and nature can thrive;\n\n\u2022 safe and high-quality public spaces, with  \ngood-quality, affordable, accessible and healthy  \nhousing for residents;\n\n\u2022 inclusive access to services and jobs within walking \ndistance or reachable by short and convenient public \ntransport journeys seamlessly integrated with an active \ntransport (walking and cycling) infrastructure;\n\n\u2022 clean energy and smart technologies harnessed to \nincrease well-being, reduce environmental impact  \nand protect ecosystems;\n\n\u2022 efficient and circular use of resources (water, energy,  \nland, materials) and adaptive solutions to energy and \nwater demands;\n\n\u2022 environmental, natural and physical assets preserved  \nand enhanced for future generations;\n\n\u2022 resilience against and adapted to the growing  \nimpacts and risks from climate change and natural \nhazards;\n\n\u2022 local governance with the capacity to carry out its \nfunctions with active participation from citizens.\n\nThus, in addition to the environmental dimension, urban \nenvironmental sustainability also has a 'human-centred' \ndimension, enhancing and changing how people live,  \ninteract and engage with cities.\n\n2.2.2 Purpose and evolution of the conceptual framework \n\nUrban systems are inherently complex (see Section 2.1), as is \nthe concept of urban environmental sustainability. If we are to \nunderstand what factors may influence the transition towards \nurban environmental sustainability, it is important to improve our \nunderstanding of the concept. Hence, a conceptual framework \nfor urban environmental sustainability has been developed.\n\nA conceptual framework attempts to explain a phenomenon. \nIt seeks to map out a theoretical structure of assumptions, \ncomponents, principles, etc., that holds together the \nideas comprising a broad concept. In the case of urban \nenvironmental sustainability, it is important to understand what \nfactors \u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether they be components or variables acting \nas enablers or barriers, for example \u2014 need to be in place or \navoided to facilitate transitions towards urban environmental \nsustainability.\n\nThe logic behind the development of a conceptual framework \nis that it is required to understand complexity and provide a \nframework for consistent assessment and analysis. Breaking \ndown a concept into components also enables analysis to \nconsider interrelationships between individual components \nwhile maintaining perspective on the whole concept, which is \nimportant in helping to understand a complex system.\n\nFor the EEA, a conceptual framework will help provide a clear \nstructure for its thinking on urban environmental sustainability \nassessments (see Figure 2.1), including in terms of:\n\n\u2022 the key components and outcomes that should define a \nvision of environmental sustainability in an urban context  \nin Europe; \n\n\u2022 the components required to support the transition of \nEuropean cities towards a more sustainable future, \nparticularly focusing on urban environmental sustainability.\n\nFigure 2.1 Illustration of the need for a conceptual framework to help understand what influences the transition \ntowards urban environmental sustainability\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\nTransition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nWhat enablers need \nto be in place?\n\nWhat barriers need\nto be avoided?\n\nWhat outcomes are \npart of the vision?\n\nWhat components\nare required?\n\nWhat is the influence\nof complexity?\n\nWhat contextual\nfactors are influential?\n\nWhat are the different\nperspectives?\n\nWhat qualities and\nprocesses contribute?\n\f\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework\n\n42 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nFigure 2.2 Conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\nCU\nLT\n\nURE \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGOVERNANCE  \n\n \n \n\nKNOW\nLEDGE \n\nTECH\nN\n\nOLOGY \n \n\n \n\n \nDATA AND INFORMATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFI\nN\n\nAN\nCE\n\n \n\nEnvironmental \nquality\n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nPublic \nopen space\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nEcological\nmulti\nfunctionality\n\nSustainable \nurban\n\n agriculture\n\nRenewable\nenergy\n\nLow energy\n consumption\n\nEnergy \nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial \n\nuse and zero \nwaste\n\nResource \nefficiency\n\nSustainable\nmobility\n\nGreen\neconomy\n\nBuilt \nenvironmental\n\nquality\n\nIntegrated\nplanning\n\nHousing\nplanning\n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \n\njustice\n\nParticipation\nand\n\nempowerment\n\nCollaborative \nand \n\ncommunity-led\ninitiatives\n\nTHE\n(SUSTAINABLE)\n\nCITY\n\nLow-carbon city lens\n\nCircular city lens\n\nHealthy city lens\n\nInclusive city lens\n\nGreen city lens\n\nResilient city lens\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nEnabling factors\n\nLenses\n\nContext (the geography of a \nparticular city as well as its urban \nform, infrastructure, people, \ninstitutions, etc.)\n\nCO2\n\nCONTEXT\n\f\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework\n\n43Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nGiven the complexity and interdependence of urban systems, it \nis acknowledged that attempting to categorise distinct elements \nis reductionist and potentially oversimplistic. However, a \nsimple model or framework should help us to understand \nthese complex concepts and will assist the EEA to develop its \nknowledge base and inform its assessments.\n\nThe development of the conceptual framework was informed \nby a knowledge review of EEA and other literature, a review \nof key EU policy frameworks, and feedback from stakeholders \nthroughout. Early in the process of developing the framework, \nfour types of cities were identified: the resilient city, the \ncircular city, the green city and the inclusive city. This model \nwas further developed in 2017 and tested both with internal \n(EEA) stakeholders and with external stakeholders at events \nin Copenhagen in December 2017 and November 2018. A \nmeta-analysis of drivers of sustainability transitions was also \ncompleted to further understand the factors supporting urban \nenvironmental sustainability and to consider the extent to \nwhich benchmarking may be possible.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020 several iterations of the proposed \nconceptual framework were developed in collaboration with \nstakeholders, both internal (EEA) and external. The starting \npoint was the EEA's initial four broad categories of sustainable \ncity, which were complemented with two further ones (the \nhealthy city and the low-carbon city). Following the results of \nthe knowledge review, the original approach was to upgrade \nthe initial categories by adding further lenses of analysis, \nintroducing the notion of enabling factors and developing \nassessment topics. This 'taxonomy' approach, comprising \ndifferent 'levels' of urban sustainability components served the \npurpose of bringing richness to the relatively simplistic initial \nmodel while keeping track of the essential features of such a \nmodel and aligning it with environment and climate policies.\n\nThe proposed conceptual framework is presented in \nSection 2.2.3, which includes a description of the framework \ncomponents: six lenses, six enabling factors and 19 building \nblocks. The conceptual framework has provided the focus for \nthe urban nexus approach (see Chapter 3) and the analysis of \ndrivers of urban environmental sustainability transitions (see \nChapter 4).\n\n2.2.3 The structure and components of the conceptual \nframework\n\nFigure 2.2 presents an overarching conceptual framework for \nurban environmental sustainability. The conceptual framework \nis based on four main components. These are:\n\n\u2022 Lenses \u2014 a range of perspectives on urban environmental \nsustainability that represent priority issues or concerns \nreflecting the EEA's environmental remit and that can be \nused to guide and focus assessment and analysis.\n\n\u2022 Context \u2014 the range of current and historical physical, \nsocial and institutional characteristics that create and \nshape the setting in which a specific city exists, develops \nand functions. Each city's context has a considerable \ninfluence on the transition to urban environmental \nsustainability.\n\n\u2022 Enabling factors \u2014 relatively high-level forces that,  \nbased on their level of availability, facilitate (drivers)  \nor hinder (barriers) the transition to urban  \nenvironmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Building blocks \u2014 key qualities that contribute to  \nurban environmental sustainability. Depending on the \ncontext and enabling factors, different building blocks  \nwill be the inputs required to transition towards urban  \nenvironmental sustainability. \n\nEach of these components is described in more detail in the \nsections below.\n\nLenses on urban environmental sustainability\n\nThe six lenses represent headline perspectives on \nurban environmental sustainability reflecting the EEA's \nenvironmental remit. They also cover the key elements of \nrelevant EU environment and climate policies and frameworks. \nThese perspectives are not conflicting and may overlap, and \ntogether they mutually reinforce the transitions towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability. The lenses provide a  \nhigh-level frame to guide more nuanced assessment and \nanalysis, for example at the level of building blocks or \ncollections of building blocks. The six urban environmental \nsustainability lenses are presented and described in  \nFigure 2.3.\n\nThere is a range of other terms and formations of cities that  \nare used in the literature and by different organisations and \nthat could represent additional lenses, such as 'smart cities', \n'future cities', 'liveable cities', 'compact cities' and 'garden cities'  \n(Moir et al., 2014). These terms and frameworks are often \nrelatively broad and can overlap; are sometimes associated \nwith certain contexts, geographies or disciplines; and can have \nhybrid or ambiguous meanings. In developing the lenses, \nthe intention was to convey a relatively clear and simple set \nof perspectives on urban environmental sustainability that \ncapture the EEA's priority interests given its remit (see also \nSection\u00a02.2.1). The selected lenses are not trying to replace or \nreplicate these other terms and framings, which have equal \nvalidity and could be used in combination with the lenses. \nThere will also be links between some of the enabling factors \nand buildings blocks in the EEA's conceptual framework and \nthese other terms and frameworks. Aspects of these terms and \nframeworks also emerge through the analysis of urban nexuses \nand drivers presented in Chapters 3 and 4, such as inclusion, \nliveability and compactness.\n\f\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework\n\n44 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThe low carbon city - City that has achieved or is moving towards achieving low-carbon practices in all its aspects including \n                                                    economy, daily life (e.g. travel), politics and culture.\n\nThe circular city - City in which all products and material streams can be brought back into the cycle after use, \n      and become a resource for new products and services.  \n\nThe healthy city - City with physical and social environments and community resources which enable people to perform \n      all the functions of life and develop to their maximum potential.\n\nThe inclusive city - City in which the processes of development include a wide variety of citizens and activities involve spatial, \n         social and economic inclusion.\n\nThe green city - City models based on approaches to functional and ecological urban development design provide healthy \n  and sustainable environments for both natural systems and communities.\n\nThe resilient city - City in which the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems \n        enable it to survive, adapt, and grow in response to chronic stresses and acute shocks.   \n\nCO2\n\nPERSPECTIVES ON URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n\nTaking the example of compact cities, they have long been \nconsidered to have a range of potential benefits, which include \ndense development patterns, better accessibility of local \nservices and jobs, short intra-urban distances and efficient \npublic transport systems that make positive contributions to \nthe efficiency of infrastructure investment and reducing energy \nconsumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as \ncontributing to knowledge diffusion and economic growth \n(OECD, 2020). This concept clearly has some overlaps with the \ncharacteristics of urban environmental sustainability described \nabove, but the lenses aim to provide a more disaggregated set \nof perspectives to aid analysis rather than a holistic formation \nof future cities.\n\nIn relation to COVID-19, there are emerging studies that \ninvestigate the correlation of cases of and deaths from the \nvirus with both the population size and density of functional \nurban areas. But it is important to note in the context of \ncompact cities that it is not density alone that makes cities \npotentially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 but the \nstructural economic and social conditions of cities that make \nthem more or less able to implement effective policy responses. \nFor instance, cities marked by inequalities, inadequate \nhousing conditions and a high concentration of urban poor \nare potentially more vulnerable than those that are better \nresourced, less crowded and more equal (OECD, 2020).\n\nContext\n\nContext is defined as the range of current and historical physical \n(e.g. geographical, environmental), social and institutional \ncharacteristics that create and shape the setting in which a \n\nFigure 2.3 The urban environmental sustainability lenses\n\nspecific city exists, develops and functions. These characteristics \ninfluence the ability of a city to transition to environmental \nsustainability.\n\nThese characteristics may include:\n\n\u2022 geographical location (e.g. coastal, mountainous)  \nand natural assets;\n\n\u2022 climatic conditions;\n\n\u2022 city size and urban form (e.g. level of compactness, ratio \nbetween green and built space, the relationship between \nurban, peri-urban and rural areas);\n\n\u2022 demographics, including level of inequality, gentrification \nand poverty;\n\n\u2022 structure of the economy;\n\n\u2022 existing infrastructure (e.g. public transport network, utilities);\n\n\u2022 institutional arrangements; \n\n\u2022 other unique aspects that form the complex system of an \nindividual city.\n\nEnabling factors\n\nEnabling factors are relatively high-level forces that facilitate \nor hinder environmental sustainability. Enabling factors can \ninfluence the degree of initiation and continuation of some \n\f\nUrban environmental sustainability: a framework\n\n45Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\ntypes of action. Each enabling factor is associated with  \nclusters of characteristics that act as drivers or barriers  \nto the transition towards urban environmental sustainability. \nThey are likely to be specific to a particular city based on  \nits unique characteristics (e.g. the governance, cultural or \nother characteristics of a city). Although the drivers  \nassociated with an enabling factor are not sufficient by \nthemselves to ensure that sustainability transitions will  \nbe initiated, they will support this process, and their  \nassociated barriers may hinder, delay, or constrain such \ndevelopment (Lee and Klassen, 2008). Specific drivers  \n\nmay help initiate and motivate individuals or organisations  \nto take action to achieve certain objectives, and conversely \nspecific barriers may have a negative influence on or  \nconstrain taking action.\n\nSix enabling factors have been identified \u2014 culture, \nknowledge, data and information, technology, governance, \nand finance \u2014 which help frame the transitions towards \nachieving urban environmental sustainability.

Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n2.3 Applying the conceptual framework in \nthe analysis for urban environmental \nsustainability\n\n2.3.1 Operationalising the conceptual framework\n\nThe conceptual framework is intended to be used to structure \nassessments and analysis of cities from the perspective of \nenvironmental sustainability. Such analyses could be top down \nby institutions such as the EEA or bottom up by individual \nmunicipalities or cities. The conceptual framework can be used to \nidentify potential analytical tools (e.g. indicators and supporting \ndata sets, assessment methodologies, case studies) as part of the \nanalysis. This in turn will provide the basis for the EEA's current \nand future urban environmental sustainability assessments.\n\nGiven the complexity of and interactions between processes \nand policies within urban systems, the components of the \nconceptual framework are intended to provide a pragmatic \nmeans of structuring analysis, for example by focusing on \nspecific building blocks. Analyses can also be focused using the \nlenses, such that a particular perspective (e.g. low-carbon city \nor healthy city) is selected to provide a logical framing of the \nanalysis and a means of managing the complexity involved.\n\nThe six lenses and six enabling factors introduced in the \nconceptual framework can serve in particular as the starting \npoints for analysis. The building blocks provide a more detailed \nfocus for analysis through which urban sustainability is viewed. \nData or indicators and examples could capture each building \nblock. However, given the breadth and scope of the topic of \nurban environmental sustainability, it is likely that various \nanalytical tools will need to be used in line with the EEA's \ntypology of knowledge and MDIAK approach (38) with a focus on \nthe indicators-assessments-knowledge aspects.\n\nSome enabling factors and building blocks are already fully \nor partially reported against in pan-European assessments \nof empirical data (e.g. different dimensions of urban \nenvironmental quality and renewable energy production), \nwhereas others are not supported by existing empirical data. \nThese will need to draw on qualitative data, for example from \nsurveys and interviews, and the findings of discrete case studies \nof city examples where pan-European empirical data are \nunavailable (e.g. integrated planning, design and policymaking). \nHowever, there are likely to be gaps and deficiencies in the \nevidence base and prioritising the filling of these gaps  \nand/or addressing the deficiencies is an issue to consider  \nin future research.\n\nThere is a danger of oversimplification when looking at analysis \nstructured using the conceptual framework (interlinkages \nbetween elements are ignored for the purposes of using/\ndeveloping single indicators, etc.). However, the identification \n\nand analysis of nexus issues (see Chapter 3) provides \nan example of a more integrated approach, recognising \nthe inherently complex and transversal nature of urban \nsustainability issues.\n\nThe EEA approach to the analysis of urban environmental \nsustainability is based around mixed methods, creating \nnarratives that draw on both qualitative and quantitative \ndata. The EEA is developing two initial approaches to urban \nsustainability assessment, drawing on the conceptual \nframework: urban nexus analysis and analysis of drivers and \nbarriers (learning from the experience of pioneering cities).  \nThe approach used in each of these approaches is  \ndescribed below.\n\n2.3.2 Examples of forms of analysis\n\nThere are various forms of analysis that could be undertaken \nas part of assessing the current status quo or transition options \nfor achieving urban environmental sustainability. This could \nbe undertaken at a range of geographies with an urban focus, \nfrom the European or regional scale through to the scale of \nindividual cities, metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations. \nFacilitating different forms of analysis of urban environmental \nsustainability may help decision-makers to identify relevant \npolicy options and priorities.\n\nExamples of types of analysis include:\n\n\u2022 analysis of the current status of and/or progress towards \nachieving targets for individual or collections of building \nblocks;\n\n\u2022 analysis using a specific lens (the resilient city, the green \ncity, the low-carbon city, the inclusive city, the healthy city, \nthe circular city) as a framework; \n\n\u2022 analysis of drivers of and barriers to transitions towards \nurban environmental sustainability relevant to each of the \nenabling factors.\n\nSuch analysis could be used to identify key strengths \nand weaknesses in transitions to urban environmental \nsustainability, and therefore could be used to identify where  \nto prioritise future action.\n\nIn the following two chapters, specific forms of analysis are \nillustrated. Chapter 3 presents an analysis using a nexus \napproach, which is a particularly useful approach given the \ncomplexity of the urban system and the need to focus on \nconnections between elements, perspectives, policies and \nsectors. Chapter 4 provides an example of the analysis of \ndrivers and barriers.\n\n(38) MDIAK: M, monitoring; D, data; I, information; A, assessment; K, knowledge, understanding, action.

The urban nexus approach, through which two or more urban policy areas are considered together, can \nhelp to identify synergies, co-benefits and trade-offs. In this way opportunities can be prioritised to achieve better \ncoordinated and cost-effective policymaking and action.\n\n\u2022 To achieve transitions policy needs to be integrated vertically and horizontally \u2014 cities often have a degree of \nautonomy in their governance and so they can, to some extent, influence change independently. However, cities also \nhave interrelationships and interdependencies at different scales, including at the EU and national scales, as well as \nwith neighbourhoods and communities. The nexus approach focuses on the horizontal integration of policy within a \ncity; however, it is also important to consider vertical integration of policy between a city and other scales.\n\n\u2022 The priority urban nexuses analysed in this chapter illustrate how interconnected and complex urban systems \nare \u2014 the eight example nexuses selected for assessment (climate resilience; quality of life; urban accessibility; \nenvironment and health; food security; closing the loop; clean energy; and sustainable buildings) all operate at \ndifferent levels and interact in many ways. For example, meeting the nexus objective of urban climate resilience relates \nto other nexus objectives, in particular quality of life, urban accessibility, environment and health, and food security. \nHowever, assessing the nexuses individually helps break down the challenges into more manageable issues while also \nstill considering their interconnectedness. \n\nChapter 1 describes the systemic environmental challenges \nthat Europe and European cities need to address. Cities \nalso need to accommodate a greater number of people in \nthe coming decades while improving the quality of life of \ntheir residents. To do so, European cities must urgently shift \ntowards a more integrated approach to addressing these \nsystemic challenges (EEA, 2017a), reflecting the role of cities as \nactors set out in Chapter 2. The European environment \u2014 state \nand outlook 2020 report (SOER 2020) stresses the need for \npolicy integration and cross-cutting strategies to address key \nsystems (e.g. energy, mobility) and support the transformation \nto a low-carbon and circular economy. This chapter introduces \nthe nexus concept and its application within an urban context. \nNexus analysis provides a way of helping us to understand \ncomplex systems and identify better coordinated polices and \nactions to support urban environmental sustainability.\n\n3.1 Urban nexus analysis\n\nSOER 2020 stresses that achieving sustainability transitions \nrequires coherence across policy domains and scales. \nPolicymaking and action are often developed in silos, addressing \nspecific sectors or issues, with contrasting objectives (EEA, \n2019a). Likewise, research and knowledge development are \nfrequently compartmentalised along disciplinary boundaries. \nThis means that misalignment and conflicts are inevitable, and \nthis limits shared understanding of systemic challenges and \nresponses that fully reflect the barriers, opportunities, tradeoffs and co-benefits associated with systemic change (EEA, \n2019a). There is a need for policies that embrace the inherent \ninterconnectedness of systems components, interactions across \nsystems, and links between economic, social and environmental \ngoals (EEA, 2019a).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n52 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThis is certainly the case in cities and metropolitan areas and \ntheir peripheries, where the complexity of interactions between \nsocio-economic and environmental factors presents significant \nchallenges for improving citizens' quality of life while minimising \nenvironmental pressures and resource depletion. However, \nas noted, urban areas also provide opportunities for positive \nsystemic change. What is needed is better coordination and \nprioritisation of policymaking and action across sectors. The \nprioritisation aspect is particularly important here, as 'total \nintegration' of everything with everything as part of political \nprocesses is impossible. However, recognising and prioritising \ncritical interrelationships that have not been addressed \nappropriately is the first key step towards achieving better \nintegrated policymaking (Rode, 2018). By considering priority \ninterlinkages between systems and policy areas, environmental, \n\n(39) A co-benefit is where the delivery of one policy area or intervention can help achieve outcomes in another policy area. For example, an \nintervention to encourage active travel (walking and cycling) could have the main objective of improving public health but might have \nco-benefits of reducing congestion and air and noise pollution, thus improving quality of life.\n\nsocial and economic trade-offs and co-benefits (39) can be \nidentified (Rode, 2018; EEA, 2019a).\n\nOne approach to thinking about the interactions between \nsystems and policies is the nexus approach. Box 3.1 provides \nmore information on the nexus concept, approach and analysis. \nA nexus is defined as the interlinkages and interrelationships \nbetween two or more systems (e.g. food and energy) or policy \nareas. Nexus analysis refers to the identification and analysis of \nthe interactions, interrelations and interdependencies among \nsectors and policies or other interventions. The nexus approach \ninvolves proactive and integrated policy engagement with such \ninterrelated sectors, resulting in a new approach to policymaking \nand action. In an urban context this means considering together \ntwo or more urban policy areas in order to address a specific \n\nBox 3.1 The nexus concept and its use in an urban context\n\nThe term 'nexus' by definition refers to the interlinkages or connections between two or more elements. A 'nexus approach' \nimplies explicitly considering these connections or interlinkages between resources or sectors and the implications of these in, \nfor example, the context of a strategic or policy goal (Magic Nexus, 2018). Hoff (2011) puts the nexus approach in the context of \nsystem efficiency over sector productivity: 'The nexus focus is on system efficiency, rather than on the productivity of isolated \nsectors'. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations considers the nexus as a 'conceptual approach to better \nunderstand and systematically analyse the interactions between the natural environment and human activities, and to work \ntowards a more coordinated management and use of natural resources across sectors and scales' (FAO, 2014).\n\nThe nexus approach therefore explicitly recognises synergies and trade-offs as necessary for the development of response \noptions. The approach helps to ensure the sustainability of the environment and people's livelihoods, facilitating more \nintegrated and cost-effective policymaking, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThe EEA's 2020 state of the environment report introduces the concept of the 'resource nexus'. This recognises that 'links \nbetween... systems arise because of their shared reliance on natural systems, both as a source of resources and as a sink for \nwastes and emissions'. This shared reliance means that 'addressing problems in one area may simply shift the burden to other \nsystems'. A resource nexus approach can also help highlight the interdependence of production and consumption systems and \ntheir cumulative impacts (e.g. on ecosystems). Achieving the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy 'will require \nthat the interlinkages across systems are considered and the trade-offs and co-benefits identified' (EEA, 2019a).\n\nThe focus of existing definitions of the nexus approach is predominantly on resource efficiency and the management of \nscarcity. However, in an urban context, a different focus may be appropriate. UNESCAP (2016) discusses the urban nexus as \nfocusing on the interlinkages among various elements and their 'conversion pathways' \u2014 the extraction, supply, distribution, \nend use, disposal \u2014 in consumption and production chains of socio-economic sectors. Furthermore, UNESCAP suggests that \ncities serve as a nexus, or a focal point that connects and is shaped by economic, technological and social forces (UNESCAP, \n2016). UNESCAP (2016) and Lehman (2018) propose an 'intra-urban nexus' and a 'nested urban nexus', the former focusing \n'solely on what is urban in the nexus framing', including urban metabolism, infrastructure and human security, while the latter \nrecognises that nexus dynamics need to be understood in the context of driving and constraining forces at both lower and \nhigher levels, meaning that nexus analysis at a city level will need to consider developments at other levels, e.g. global, regional \nor national policy developments and ecosystems at sub-national and regional levels.\n\nICLEI and GIZ (2014) define the use of urban nexus analysis as an 'approach that guides stakeholders to identify and pursue \npossible synergies between sectors, jurisdictions, and technical domains, so as to increase institutional performance, optimize \nresource management, and service quality'. Rode (2018) discusses the urban nexus as helping to facilitate a move away from  \nthe 'functionally segregated city and its simplistic view of the relationship between urban life and city design' towards an \napproach that can 'better address the complexities, interrelationships and co-dependencies \u2026 characteristic of city systems'. \nRode (2018) in particular focuses on what is seen as 'the critical nexus' of urban form and transport, which provides a good \nillustration of the nexus approach in practice, as 'both elements need to be dealt with jointly to provide accessibility to people, \ngoods and ideas in cities'.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n53Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nurban environmental sustainability problem or to advance a \npolicy objective. By identifying priority synergies, co-benefits and \ntrade-offs, opportunities can be identified for better coordinated \nand integrated policymaking and action.\n\nConsidering urban issues in this way is intended to improve \nunderstanding of interactions and enable more coherent and \neffective policy and other interventions that can identify and \nminimise trade-offs and 'reduce environmental pressures \u2026 \nrealising potential co-benefits for human health and well-being' \n(EEA, 2019a). A nexus approach can help decision-makers to \nchoose the most appropriate policy measures or other actions \nto help identify cost-effective interventions and minimise hidden \nor unanticipated costs. Cost-effectiveness is defined as either, \nfor a given outcome (e.g. a percentage reduction in air pollution), \nminimising the net-present value of costs or, for a given cost, \nmaximising the relevant outcome(s) (EC,\u00a02014). In the context \nof urban environmental sustainability, cost-effectiveness also \nconsiders the co-benefits of an intervention (e.g. the health \nbenefits of meeting a primary objective of reduced air pollution).\n\nIn summary, the potential benefits of conducting nexus analysis \nfor urban environmental sustainability are to:\n\n\u2022 help manage the complexity of urban systems by identifying \ncritical interrelationships, co-dependencies and tradeoffs between selected aspects of urban environmental \nsustainability and/or desired policies and other \ninterventions;\n\n\u2022 identify and assess specific counteracting and reinforcing \npolicies and other interventions and their outcomes;\n\n\u2022 improve understanding of how to achieve multiple \noutcomes and objectives together and take advantage of \nco-benefits;\n\n\u2022 identify opportunities for improved policy integration and \nefficacy, by jointly considering multiple objectives and \ndesired outcomes; \n\n\u2022 through the above, help to identify cost-effective urban \nsustainability policy and action. \n\n3.1.1 Interactions with and dependencies on policy  \nat different scales\n\nEU cities often have a degree of autonomy in their governance \nand budgetary arrangements. The analysis of urban \nsustainability nexuses presented in this chapter focuses in \nparticular on policymaking and action that cities can directly \ninfluence and control. The extent of this control will vary \nbetween cities and metropolitan areas, depending on factors \nsuch as their size and the governance arrangements in different \ncountries; however, the analysis aims to draw out lessons that \ncan have broad relevance. The intention is to explore how \n\npolicies and actions can be better coordinated and prioritised \nby city authorities (and within cities) to help achieve urban \nsustainability outcomes.\n\nAlthough cities can be seen as representing complex systems \nin themselves (at the level of the city or functional urban area), \nthey also have interrelationships and interdependencies across \ndifferent scales. Figure 3.1 illustrates policy integration operating \nat different scales. In the EU, high-level policy, targets and \nvisions are set at the EU level, and Member States have their \nown urban policy and regulatory frameworks, including those \nrelated to the implementation of EU directives. Some countries \nhave governance at a regional scale, and below this sits city- and \nsub-city-level governance. As illustrated in Figure\u00a03.1, policy \nintegration can therefore be viewed:\n\n\u2022 vertically \u2014 policy areas operating across different scales or \nlevels (e.g. EU, national, city); \n\n\u2022 horizontally \u2014 different policies or actions implemented and \ninteracting with each other at a particular scale or level.\n\nThe nexus analysis considers both of these types of integration. \nEach nexus recognises the importance of EU and national policy \nframeworks and targets, while the analysis focuses on the \nidentification and assessment of horizontal policy interactions. \nThe aim is to help move towards more integrated policymaking \nand interventions in cities, and in this way to support the \ntransition to urban environmental sustainability. In Figure 3.1 \nthis is illustrated by the red triangle, highlighting as an example \nthe nexus between the transport, housing and energy policy \nareas, which operate at the city level (horizontal integration) but \nare influenced by and need to be integrated with higher-level \npolicy and in turn will influence lower spheres (vertical \nintegration).\n\nFigure 3.1 Vertical and horizontal policy integration\n\nEU level\n\nNational level\n\nRegional level\n\nCity level\n\nHORIZONTAL POLICY INTEGRATION\n\nVE\nRT\n\nIC\nA\n\nL \nPO\n\nLI\nCY\n\n IN\nTE\n\nG\nRA\n\nTI\nO\n\nN\n\nTransport policy\n\nHousing policy\n\nEnergy policy\nNatural environment policy\n\nSpatial planning policy\n\nExample\nnexus\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n54 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n3.2 Priority urban sustainability nexuses\n\nDrawing on the conceptual framework (see Chapter 2), \nliterature review and stakeholder input, eight priority urban \nsustainability nexuses were identified and selected. Figure 3.2 \npresents an overview of these nexuses. The eight nexuses were \nselected to cover a range of key urban sustainability objectives, \nand to reflect the main topics addressed by EU environmental \nand climate policies. They also highlight some of the most \ncritical interrelationships between sectors, which are currently \nnot considered appropriately as part of policymaking and \naction. They are not, however, intended to be comprehensive, \nas a great many other sustainability objectives and critical \ninterrelationships exist, and in meeting these objectives a very large \nnumber of critical policy interactions or nexuses could be identified.\n\nThe overall aim of the urban nexus analysis is to explore critical \ninterlinkages and interrelationships between two or more policy \nareas that need to be considered together in order to advance \nan urban sustainability objective. The selected urban nexuses \nare intended to be examples of how this analysis approach \ncould be used in practice to identify existing challenges to \nachieving urban sustainability objectives and opportunities to \nmove towards better coordinated and integrated policymaking \nand action. The interlinked policy areas that need to be \nconsidered to achieve the nexus objectives that were selected \nas part of the analysis of the eight priority nexuses are \nillustrated in Figure 3.2.\n\nEach nexus is framed around meeting a high-level urban \nsustainability objective (e.g. climate resilience, food security) \nthat is systemic in nature and requires coordinated \npolicymaking and action. Meeting these nexus objectives \ncould require interventions in a large number of policy areas. \n\nHowever, for the nexus analysis in each case, three interlinked \npolicy areas were selected to help identify examples of key \ninteractions, challenges and opportunities for prioritisation  \nand coordination of policy and interventions. Different or \nadditional policy areas could be selected to broaden the \nanalysis or to focus on other policy priorities. However, the \nselection for this analysis is intended to represent some of  \nthe key areas in which coordinated policy is required. Although \ndifferent cities may use different terminology and have \ndivergent levels of authority or autonomy, the selected policy \nareas are intended to be representative of strategy, policy and \nother interventions commonly seen in cities. For example, in \nareas such as housing, transport, waste management or spatial \nplanning, specific policies, standards and budgets are often set \nat a municipal or city level.\n\nThe assessment draws on the conceptual framework  \n(see Chapter 2) by considering actions in the context of the \n'building blocks' of urban sustainability that are relevant to the \nkey policy areas in each nexus. Each nexus analysis also explores \none example of a challenge and the actions to address it in \nmore detail. By focusing the analysis in this way, the intention is \nto facilitate a more detailed assessment than would be possible \nif a larger number of challenges and actions were considered. \nOf course, each nexus has many potential challenges and \nassociated actions and these will differ from city to city.\n\nThe nexus analysis is based on an assessment of what \nchallenges cities typically face in meeting urban sustainability \nobjectives, which critical interrelationships are currently  \n'under-serviced' and how action can be better coordinated  \nand/or prioritised across the selected policy areas. In doing  \nso, the analysis can identify co-benefits and trade-offs and  \nhelp to improve the cost-effectiveness of interventions.\n\nFigure 3.2 Key interlinked policy areas considered in the analysis of the priority nexuses\n\nHORIZONTAL POLICY INTEGRATION\n\nENVIRONMENT AND\nSOCIETY NEXUSES\n\nSpatia\nl p\n\nlanning polic\ny\n\nClosing the loop\n\nSustainable building\n\nClean energy\n\nRESOURCES AND\nENERGY NEXUSES\n\nClimate resilience\n\nEnvironment & health\n\nUrban accessibility\n\nQuality of life\n\nFood security\n\nUrban design polic\ny\n\nBuilt \nenviro\n\nnment p\nolic\n\ny\n\nHousing polic\ny\n\nTransport \npolic\n\ny\n\nEnviro\nnment p\n\nolic\ny\n\nGreen in\nfra\n\nstru\ncture polic\n\ny\n\nNature and biodiversity\n polic\n\ny\n\nUrban fo\nod polic\n\ny\n\nWaste m\nanagement p\n\nolic\ny\n\nResources and m\nateria\n\nls polic\ny\n\nGreen economy polic\ny\n\nEnergy polic\ny\n\nCity Level\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n55Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nAlthough no hierarchy of nexuses is intended, some do represent \nhigher-level or more overarching sustainability objectives, while \nothers are more specific. For example, meeting the high-level \nnexus objective of 'climate resilience' relates to other nexus \nobjectives, in particular 'quality of life', 'urban accessibility', \n'environment and health', and 'food security'. These relationships \n\nare in themselves complex and bi-directional. For example, \nimproving 'urban accessibility' or 'environment and health' \nthrough the creation, enhancement or change in use of green \ninfrastructure (GI) can also enhance a city's resilience to climate \nchange ('climate resilience' nexus).

Nexuses that primarily relate to 'resources and energy' \nare grouped together in Table 3.1.\n\nIn addition to the key interactions reflected in the grouping of \nnexuses into 'environment and society' nexuses or 'resources \nand energy' nexuses, there will also be a range of other relationships \nbetween the nexuses. Continuing the example of 'closing the \n\nloop', a circular economy in cities would also contribute to  \nother nexus outcomes, including 'environment and health',  \nas improved resource management practices can reduce local \npollution levels; improved 'quality of life' through improved \nenvironmental quality and the provision of urban resource \ncentres that can act as community hubs; and 'food security', \nwhere local food initiatives to reduce food waste improve access \nto food. Similar relationships will exist between all nexuses.\n\nEach nexus is analysed separately, to keep the level of detail \nmanageable (see Sections 3.3-3.10). However, reflecting the \nnature of cities as complex systems, in practice the nexuses \ndo not stand alone but overlap and interact with each other in \nvarious ways and at different scales.

The importance \nof urban resilience to climate change is emphasised in the \nEU adaptation strategy (EC, 2013) and the climate adaptation \npartnership of the urban agenda for the EU (Climate Adaptation \nPartnership, 2018). The European Commission announced in \nthe European Green Deal communication that it plans to adopt \na new, more ambitious EU strategy on adaptation to climate \nchange in 2020/2021 (EC, 2019a; EEA, 2020b). To provide a  \nlegal basis for achieving the European Green Deal's goal of  \nthe EU being climate neutral by 2050, the European \nCommission has proposed the first European Climate Law  \n(EEA, 2020b). The law aims to ensure that all EU policies and  \nall sectors of the economy and society contribute to the  \ngoal of climate neutrality.\n\nA range of perspectives and definitions of resilience exist \nacross policy, practice and research. This includes narrow,  \nengineering-based, structural definitions of resilience and \ninterdisciplinary concepts focused on the interrelationship \nbetween social and ecological systems (Armitage et al., 2012). \n\nGreen \ninfrastructure\n\nExample challenge and action: \nManaging urban flood risk by \nusing nature-based solutions\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to\nenhance climate resilience\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\n\nKey building blocks\nsupporting climate resilience\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nSpatial\nplanning\n\nBuilt\nenvironment\n\nGreen\nand blue\n\ninfrastructure \n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nSustainable\nurban\n\nagriculture\n\nBuilt\nenvironment\n\nquality\n\nIntegrated\nplanning\n\nParticipation \nand\n\nempowerment\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n58 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nA distinction is also made between proactive and reactive \nresilience. Reactive resilience focuses on resistance and \n'bounce-back' after a shock and suggests a return to the \nstatus quo. Proactive resilience emphasises adaptation to and \ntransformation in response to both shocks and stresses and \nsuggests a need to change existing conditions (Twigger-Ross \net al., 2015). Proactive resilience is particularly relevant to \nurban sustainability. By avoiding 'bouncing back' to previous, \npotentially unsustainable states, cities can adapt, transform and \nlearn while following new trajectories for future development \n(Chelleri et al., 2015).\n\nBuilding urban resilience implies moving away from \nunsustainable urban development practices while \nimplementing measures to adapt to and mitigate climate \nchange. Recognising and accounting for the synergies between \nadaptation and mitigation measures can help ensure that \nmanaging climate change impacts will also reduce greenhouse \ngas impacts and vice versa. Enhanced climate resilience will help \ncities tolerate climate change impacts and natural disasters. \nIn doing so, it reduces the risk of potential collapse in social, \neconomic and technical systems and infrastructures.\n\nIf cities enhance their climate resilience, this will also support \nprogress in some of the other priority nexuses, in particular \n'environment and health', such as through more sustainable \nuses of land and creation of GI; 'sustainable buildings', such  \nas through standards for new and retrofitted buildings to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions; and 'quality of life', such  \nas nature-based solutions that can, for example, reduce flood  \nrisk and protect people's homes.\n\nThe climate resilience nexus and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown \nmeasures altered all aspects of urban life, many cities had to \nreconsider their resilience to large shocks, including climate \nchange. Ensuring access to urban green spaces for the public \nemerged as a fundamental strategy of cities when coping with this \ncrisis. In addition, local authorities across Europe are reshaping \ntheir transport networks by reallocating some road space from \nprivate cars to public transport, pedestrians and cyclists. This has \nprovided cities with an opportunity to reduce emissions from \nvehicles and greater opportunities for greening (EEA, 2020b).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of cities \nbeing resilient to shocks. The growing awareness of resilience \nas a wider concept and the cascading effects of the COVID-19 \ncrisis across systems (e.g. mobility, food) have highlighted the \nimportance of planning for future risks. The pandemic has also \nhad a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable groups \nin society. In their resilience strategies and green recovery \nplans, city governments need to reflect on the social justice \nimplications of climate risks and adaptation actions.\n\n3.3.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving climate \nresilience in cities\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThis nexus focuses on three interconnected policy areas \nrelevant to achieving climate resilience in cities (spatial planning, \nGI and built environment) and on the building blocks relevant \nto these key policy areas (see Table 3.1). Integrating these policy \nareas could have multiple co-benefits, such as improved flood \nrisk management, enhanced carbon sequestration, improved \nair quality, increased use of active transport and improved \nquality of life. Yet, there are also some potential trade-offs. \nFor example, the creation of green spaces can lead to higher \nland and property prices in adjacent neighbourhoods and  \nmay trigger gentrification (Raymond et al., 2017; IEEP, 2021).  \nWithout accompanying policies and measures (e.g. related  \nto affordable housing) this may exacerbate inequalities  \nwithin cities.\n\nExample challenges and actions\n\nCities face many challenges in achieving climate resilience. \nThese include institutional, technical and capacity challenges; \ncompeting political priorities; processes that challenge the \nlong-term planning required; and challenges in understanding \nthe complex trade-offs between building resilience and \nmitigating climate change. Table 3.2 sets out some of the \nmain challenges cities may face in achieving climate resilience \nand gives examples of actions that could help to address \nthese challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic might encourage \nlocal policymakers to take action, as it has highlighted the \nimportance of cities being resilient to unprecedented shocks.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n59Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Weak institutional capacity and \nlack of cross-sectoral integration \nacting as a barrier to building \nadaptive capacity and reducing \nvulnerability.\n\n\u2022 Seek to build institutional capacity, e.g. by engaging with city networks on \nclimate change (e.g. Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy) and training or \nrecruiting staff.\n\n\u2022 Improve communication and integration between different departments of \nlocal administrations.\n\n\u2022 Lack of technical expertise in \nand knowledge of the range \nof climate change adaptation \napproaches (e.g. incremental \nand transformative) and specific \nmeasures that should be \nimplemented. \n\n\u2022 Adopt incremental approaches that maintain the essence and integrity of \nsystems by going beyond existing actions to deal with natural variation in \nclimate and with extreme events (e.g. upgrading sewerage systems, improving \nair conditioning, getting water from deeper wells, providing additional \nstorage, and ensuring water rationing and leakage reduction as short- and \nmedium-term solutions to deal with climate impacts).\n\n\u2022 Adopt transformative approaches that offer longer-term solutions to deal \nwith climate impacts, such as ensuring land use and spatial planning creates \nspace for water, placing infrastructure on higher ground, establishing policies \nand design standards to cool buildings through greening, reusing and \nrecycling water, and using GI to mitigate urban overheating, regulate water \nflows and mitigate flooding (see Box 3.2). \n\n\u2022 Insufficient financial resources to \ndesign and implement adaptation \nmeasures.\n\n\u2022 Explore funding mechanisms available at national and EU levels.

The \nexample focuses on using nature-based solutions (NbS) to help \nmanage urban flood risk in cities. By using natural processes, \nNbS can regulate water flows and mitigate flood risk. Box 3.3 \npresents an example of a sustainable strategy developed in \nLodz (Poland) to mitigate urban flooding by integrating NbS.\n\n3.3.3 Lessons for achieving climate resilience in cities\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the climate \nresilience nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 Given that the EU has no formal authority over spatial \nplanning, actors such as the Covenant of Mayors for Climate \n& Energy have an important role in facilitating cities to \nengage in this coordinated approach to tackle mitigation \nand adaptation to climate change.\n\n\u2022 Well-informed and coordinated planning with a long  \nlong-term perspective is important in meeting the \nchallenges posed by climate change impacts.\n\n\u2022 Developing a joint adaptation and mitigation plan in cities \nis useful in optimising the use of available resources, \naddressing trade-offs and achieving co-benefits between \nsectoral policies.\n\n\u2022 Cities may need support from the EU and national \ngovernments in the form of funding, capacity building, \nknowledge and data in order to support local adaptation \nand mitigation measures.\n\n\u2022 Integrating GI into spatial planning policies and practices \nwhile coordinating with built environment policies could \n\nBox 3.2 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: managing urban flood risk using nature-based solutions\n\nClimate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall, which is one of the main drivers \nof urban flooding (Hammond et al., 2013). Flood risk in cities is exacerbated by the extent of impermeable land surfaces, \ncoupled with housing and commercial development in river floodplains (EEA, 2016f; IEEP, 2021).\n\nTo mitigate urban flooding the use of nature-based solutions (NbS) can help to address a variety of environmental, social and \neconomic challenges associated with this risk. They are actions inspired by, supported by or copied from nature (EC, 2015b), \nfor example tree planting and creating reed beds and ponds. Maintaining and enhancing green and blue infrastructure \nis therefore of crucial importance, as it forms the basis for these solutions. It also requires spatial planning policy that \nprotects existing, or supports the creation of new, open and green spaces and facilitates their use in flood management. The \nimplementation of NbS can also replace or reduce the need for built infrastructure such as culverts and drainage.\n\nCoordinating these policy areas to reduce flood risk in cities through NbS can result in co-benefits, for example by \nimproving air quality and providing space for recreation (human health benefits), providing a buffer for habitats and \nspecies (environmental benefits) and carbon sequestration (climate mitigation benefits). Long-term urban spatial planning \nis particularly important to maximise co-benefits and limit trade-offs (EEA, 2020b).\n\nEnsuring access to urban green spaces for the public emerged as a fundamental strategy of cities in coping with the \nCOVID-19 crisis. This has provided cities with greater opportunities for greening, which supports flood prevention.\n\noptimise and strengthen the policy coordination needed to \nbuild climate resilience.\n\n\u2022 Horizontal coordination is important for climate resilience \nin cities, considering that mitigation and adaptation policies \ntend to be managed by different stakeholders at different \nspatial and governance levels (e.g. mitigation is often \nmanaged at the national level and dominated by a few \nsectors, whereas adaptation tends to involve a broader \nrange of sectors and is managed more disparately by \nindividuals or national agencies).\n\n\u2022 There is a vast range of knowledge available to cities, from \ntools and data to well-established case studies on how cities \ncan mitigate and adapt to climate impacts and determine \nthe action necessary to achieve climate resilience.\n\nThe crisis induced by COVID-19 has enabled cities to learn \nlessons about increasing resilience to climate change, as \nthis crisis has many characteristics in common with climate \nchallenges and their impacts on society (e.g. rapid emergence, \nglobal presence, disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups).\n\n3.4 Quality of life nexus\n\n3.4.1 What is quality of life and why is it important in \nan urban context?\n\nIn many respects, quality of life (QoL) has improved in \nEuropean cities in the past 50 years. The relatively high quality \nof urban living is often considered one of the most prominent \ncompetitive advantages of European cities compared with many \nother global cities. However, there are aspects (e.g. physical  \nand mental health) in which QoL has stagnated or worsened  \nin recent decades. \n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n61Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.3 Example of a policy response: urban river restoration \u2014 a sustainable strategy for stormwater \nmanagement in Lodz, Poland\n\nDuring Industrialisation, the majority of the city's many urban streams were canalised and transformed into culvert pipes.  \nThis led to frequent flooding in parts of the city during storms. In response, the city developed, in the context of the Switch project, a \nholistic approach to urban planning based on a blue-green network concept to reduce flood risk and improve the microclimate.\n\nThe approach was tested in a demonstration project on the Soko\u0142\u00f3wka river, where hydraulic rehabilitation measures, \nwetlands and three storm water reservoirs (completed in 2006, 2009 and 2010) and a sequential sedimentation bio-filtration \nsystem for stormwater purification (completed in 2011) were planned and implemented. The Soko\u0142\u00f3wka river restoration \nproject has contributed to resolving a series of climate-related challenges including reduced urban surface flooding and \nextreme flows, increased groundwater levels, improved water quality and increased urban quality of life and health.\n\nThe demonstration project in the Soko\u0142\u00f3wka valley triggered follow-up actions by private investors and increased the interest \nof civil society. The experience has convinced the Lodz authorities and water professionals of the value of replicating these for \nother rivers/cities across the country.\n\nSource: Climate-ADAPT (2020).\n\nThe disproportionate exposure of lower socio-economic groups \nto air pollution, noise and other negative environmental impacts \ntends to affect urban areas more than rural areas (EEA, 2018b). \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also disproportionately affected \nthe poorest urban residents, highlighting the huge inequalities \nthat persist when it comes to QoL. Addressing the challenge \nof inequality of opportunities and QoL is therefore of growing \nconcern for most European cities.\n\nThe term QoL is widely used in the policy literature but lacks \nan agreed definition. It can be highly subjective and dependent \non people's individual circumstances, although there is a broad \nconsensus that a good QoL is a universal desire.\n\nExisting definitions of and approaches to assessing QoL \nexplicitly link it to the natural world. This link relates to material \n(e.g. food, water and energy security) and non-material  \n(e.g. equity, freedom of choice, enjoyment of natural beauty) \ndimensions. The European Commission also recognises that \nthe quality of the natural and physical environment are key \ndeterminants of QoL (Eurostat, 2016). The evidence strongly \nsuggests that a greater focus on urban environmental quality  \nis essential in policy responses that aim to enhance QoL in \ncities. Previous work by the EEA has established environmental \nquality as a fundamental issue for social well-being and urban \nQoL (EEA, 2009).\n\nIf a better QoL is realised in cities, this is likely to support progress \nin other priority nexuses, in particular 'sustainable buildings', \nthrough well-built, well-insulated and well-ventilated housing; \n'urban accessibility', through the creation of safer, cleaner and \nmore walkable streets; and 'environment and health', through \nsufficient and biodiversity-rich green spaces accessible to all.\n\nThe quality of life nexus and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social distancing \nand lockdown measures are having a substantial impact on \n\na range of urban systems that have further affected people's \nQoL. The significant reduction in motorised traffic as a result of \nthe travel restrictions imposed across European countries and \ncities initially led to a drastic reduction in noise and air pollution \nlevels (EEA, 2020c), although the easing of restrictions partially \nreversed this positive trend. For example, air pollution levels \nhave seen a rebound in several European cities (e.g. Athens, \nLondon, Paris), driven by an increase in traffic and congestion \n(EEA, 2020d). To sustain the positive impacts on QoL, the  \nlonger-term recovery plans need to actively avoid a return  \nto 'business as usual'. One of the major risks is an increase in \nprivate motorised traffic as people continue to avoid public \ntransport. Ensuring that some of the infrastructure changes \nthat were put in place to encourage more active travel  \n(e.g. new segregated cycle lanes, wider pavements, traffic \ncalming measures) become permanent will help to ensure  \na healthier and more sustainable mobility system in future.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated the \nhuge inequalities that persist when it comes to European urban \nresidents' QoL. Local lockdowns disproportionately affected \nthe poorest urban residents, with ethnic, racial and religious \nminorities, migrants, elderly people, people with disabilities \nand other marginalised groups particularly affected. Those \nwith the lowest household incomes have been less able to \nwork from home and also experienced much higher rates of \nunemployment. This has been compounded by poor housing \nconditions, including higher exposure to air pollution, crowded \nliving conditions, poor thermal insulation and no outdoor \nspace, all of which increase the risk of COVID-19 infections \n(Ahmad et al. 2020) while negatively affecting long-term \nQoL. To reverse some of the devastating impacts on the QoL \nof the most vulnerable urban groups, recovery planning \nneeds to understand and address existing social inequalities \nwithin local communities. This includes investing in better \nhousing, reducing air pollution and improving access to \nhigh-quality public green spaces and other urban amenities in \nlow-income\u00a0neighbourhoods.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n62 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n3.4.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving urban \nquality of life\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nTogether, the natural and built environments create  \nconditions that either improve or worsen social, economic  \nand cultural elements of QoL. This nexus recognises the \nessential but often neglected role of the natural  \nenvironment in determining QoL and the way this is  \nintegrated with the built environment in cities. The QoL  \nnexus focuses on the need for coordinated policy related  \nto spatial planning, urban design, nature and biodiversity,  \nand on the building blocks relevant to these key policy areas \n(see Table 3.1). Integrating these policy areas could have  \nco-benefits, such as enhanced amenity value for people  \nand increased biodiversity.\n\nExample challenges and actions\n\nThe challenges of successfully improving QoL in cities fall into \ntwo broad categories: methodological issues and governance \nissues. Table 3.3 sets out some of the main challenges cities \nmay face in achieving good urban QoL and gives examples of \nactions that could help to address these challenges.\n\nBox 3.4 presents an example of an interlinked area of \npolicymaking and action relevant to achieving good urban  \nQoL. The example focuses on the establishment of integrated \nland use planning to increase access to green space in cities.  \nAccess to high-quality green space has been shown to reliably \nimprove people's satisfaction with where they live while also being \nlinked to improved health outcomes and promoting physical \nactivity, which in turn improves QoL. The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas also restated the value of green areas for people's QoL.  \n\nTable 3.3 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving good urban quality of life\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Methodological issues in defining and \nmeasuring QoL and determining what good \nQoL looks like.\n\n\u2022 The tensions between individual needs \nand short-term QoL improvements and \ndesires and collective, longer-term needs \nfor sustainable development.\n\n\u2022 Understanding the clear causal links between specific policy actions \nand QoL improvements, e.g. by using established indicators to \nmeasure the health impacts of more urban green space.\n\n\u2022 Taking a systemic view and considering the distributional impacts \nwhen implementing measures to improve QoL.\n\n\u2022 Poor sectoral policy and governance \nintegration hindering effective \nmainstreaming of QoL into urban  \ndecision-making processes.\n\n\u2022 Defining a clear and measurable set of QoL indicators that can be \nused to assess urban policies to track improvement over time.\n\n\u2022 Complex interactions between many \ndeterminants of QoL mean that efforts \nto promote one element can result in \nunwanted/unexpected impacts on other \nQoL element(s).\n\n\u2022 Careful monitoring of any new measures to improve QoL to ensure \nthat trade-offs are carefully considered and the distributional \nimpacts of different policies on all sectors of society are considered.\n\n\u2022 Establishing links between mental health benefits and access to \ngreen areas, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Poor environmental quality (e.g. air, water, \nnoise) and lack of access to green space \naffecting the physical and mental health of \nurban dwellers.\n\n\u2022 Excessive motorised traffic causing \npollution and community severance and \ndiscouraging safe active travel options.\n\n\u2022 Housing and built environment quality not \nmeeting the needs of residents, leading to \nhigh fuel costs and an uncomfortable living \nor working environment.\n\n\u2022 Implementing NbS that provide biodiversity-rich green spaces that \nenhance people's QoL (see Box 3.4).\n\n\u2022 Implementing traffic reduction measures, including improved \nfrequency and availability of public transport, reducing speeds, \nrestricting vehicle access to certain areas, or reallocating road space \nto other uses to reduce air and noise pollution, all of which have \nhealth and social cohesion co-benefits.\n\n\u2022 Improving housing and broader built environment by insulating \nhousing, using sustainable heating/cooling sources that reduce \nair pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and using vegetated \nrooftops, all of which have tangible health benefits while also \nreducing issues of fuel poverty and improving resilience.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n63Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.4 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: increasing access to green space through integrated land \nuse planning\n\nMany European cities already have an existing urban fabric that can be regenerated and reconfigured to increase access  \nto green space. Despite this potential, 'green recycling' (whereby previously developed grey infrastructure is redeveloped \nas green areas) remains a marginal phenomenon.\n\nDuring the lockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic people became more acquainted with their \nimmediate neighbourhoods and local green spaces. There is some evidence that this has led to an increased appreciation \nof the importance of nature (Rousseau and Deschacht, 2020). Europe's urban planners will need to play a key role in \ndesigning compact but green cities, with key amenities within walking distances. In addition, planners should design \nmobility systems that reduce travel distances and times or an extensive green infrastructure network that connects all \nnatural areas across the continent (EEA, 2019a). Another important strategy available to urban planners is the application \nof urban containment boundaries. These create 'hard' edges between the city and the countryside to ensure that \ndevelopment is not allowed to sprawl into intact natural habitats (Schulze B\u00e4ing, 2010). This not only ensures that existing \nnatural spaces and biodiversity are preserved and cities remain compact in their growth but also allows people access to \nwild areas in close proximity to the city.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the inequalities that persist for some European urban residents. Poor \nhousing conditions and no access to green space further increase the risk of COVID-19 infections (Ahmad et al., 2020)  \nwhile negatively impacting long-term quality of life. Land use policies that promote biodiversity and green space need \nto carefully monitor how investments in greening existing urban spaces affect low-income residents to avoid 'green' \ngentrification. Such policies should also ensure that the benefits of green spaces are experienced by a diverse range  \nof people irrespective of their socio-economic background (Maantay and Maroko, 2018).\n\nThey have co-benefits such as enhancing urban  \nbiodiversity, improving air quality, improving soundscapes, \nproviding a carbon sink, reducing the urban heat-island  \neffect, and absorbing stormwater. Box 3.5 presents an  \nexample of compact development and green spaces in  \nLjubljana (Slovenia).\n\n3.4.3 Lessons for achieving urban quality of life\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the urban \nQoL nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 From the environmental and sustainability perspectives, \nimplementing NbS and traffic reduction measures, as \nwell as improving the quality of housing and the built \nenvironment, are examples of the actions that potentially \naddress many challenges related to the QoL nexus.\n\n\u2022 To achieve transferability of good practices that support \nQoL across cities, short-term, sectoral and 'siloed' \ngovernance approaches need to be transformed to facilitate \nmore collaborative, integrated, holistic and long-term \nsolutions. This might support the ability to replicate and \nadjust successful interventions to suit different types and \n\nscales of sectoral and city governance, as well as specific  \ncity contexts (e.g. spatial, cultural, geographical).\n\n\u2022 Addressing the complexities associated with the \nachievement of equitable and sustainable QoL \nimprovements in cities is a shared European policy \nobjective; therefore, this should offer an incentive for truly \nhorizontal and vertical integration in policymaking.\n\n\u2022 In the post-pandemic world, as a result of changes in \npriorities, at the individual, societal and government level, \nin relation to what constitutes good urban QoL, it will be \neven more fundamental to address unsustainable urban \nlifestyles and consumption patterns. Cities need to imagine \nalternative urban futures in which there is a shift away from \nan individualistic perspective towards policies that promote \ngood QoL for all.\n\n\u2022 While exact definitions of QoL may differ between \nindividuals, cities and countries, there are several \ncommonalities. This suggests that achieving urban QoL \nwould benefit from European cities and partnerships \nexchanging knowledge across different levels of \ngovernment, civil society and the private sector.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n64 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n3.5 Urban accessibility nexus\n\n3.5.1 What is accessibility and why is it important in \nan urban context?\n\nAccessibility is generally understood to mean the ease with \nwhich people can reach goods, services and activities and \nconnect with one another (Litman, 2007; Rode et al., 2019). \nBased on this definition, urban accessibility is considered high \nwhen households can reach a wide variety of destinations \nin a short amount of time and at a low cost per unit of travel \n(Duranton and Guerra, 2016).\n\nIt is well established in the EU that providing accessibility for \neveryone, at the lowest cost to the environment, should be the \nkey objective of any transport policy (EEA, 2000). Even so, many \nEuropean cities continue to be confronted by major accessibility \nchallenges. This is because decades of transport and land use \nplanning have locked cities into prioritising a car-centric urban \ndevelopment model. Traffic congestion remains a significant \nissue for all major EU cities, costing nearly EUR 100 billion,  \nor 1 % of the EU's gross domestic product per year (EC, 2017b).\n\nMoving towards better urban accessibility is increasingly  \nseen as a fundamental precondition for achieving a range \nof urban environmental sustainability objectives. It leads to \nreduced CO2 emissions from transport, improved air quality, \nreduced noise, preservation of green space and reduced  \nhabitat fragmentation. This is because there is a strong link \nbetween a more compact urban form and transport demand. \nDenser cities generally increase accessibility through the \nproximity of urban functions and services while reducing \nresource consumption and negative environmental impacts \n(Rode et al., 2014, EEA, 2020e).\n\nIf better urban accessibility could be realised in cities, this would \nbe likely to support progress in other priority nexuses and, in \nparticular 'environment and health', through measures that \n\nreduce car use and traffic and establish multifunctional green \nspaces; 'climate resilience', s through the development of more \nsustainable transport systems; and 'quality of life', by creating \nmore liveable streets and improving access to green spaces and \nother urban amenities.\n\nThe urban accessibility nexus and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe need for immediate social distancing measures to contain \nthe spread of the virus led to rapid changes in travel behaviour \nin most cities, with far-reaching consequences for urban \naccessibility. Public transport systems were either partially \nclosed or operating at reduced capacity in many cities, especially \nat the beginning of the pandemic. For many travellers, reducing \nthe risk of infection has become the main criterion for choosing \na mode of transport, even overtaking time to reach the \ndestination and the price of the trip in importance (McKinsey \nCenter for Future Mobility, 2020). As a result, many European \ncities saw a significant increase in the number of people \nwalking and cycling for leisure and as a means of transport. This \ndemonstrated that mobility behaviours in cities are a lot more \nfluid than perhaps previously assumed.\n\nTo accommodate these new sustainable travel behaviours and \nto prevent an increase in private motorised vehicle trips, many \ncities responded with rapid infrastructure changes, including \npop-up bicycle lanes, widening pavements and closing parts \nof the city to cars. For example, Paris built 50 km of temporary \nbicycle lanes by taking space away from motor vehicles, whereas \nin Rome the creation of 150 km of new bicycle lanes has been \napproved (Zafra, 2020). In addition, a significant increase in \nhome working (for those with office-based jobs) also led to \nan overall reduction in travel demand, and the widespread \nadoption of technologies that facilitate virtual connectivity may \ncause companies to rethink the necessity of maintaining large \nand expensive inner-city office space (Deloitte, 2020).\n\nIn their pandemic recovery plans, many cities have started to \nrecognise that there can be no return to 'business as usual' \n\nBox 3.5 Example of integrated land use planning: a focus on compact development and green spaces to promote \nwell-being in Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nIn 2007 the city centre of Ljubljana was closed to all motorised traffic as part of an urban 'ecological zone' that today covers \nmore than 100 000 m2. The Ljubljana urban master plan, which forms part of the city's 2025 development vision ensures \nthat\u00a083 % of new development will be focused on existing brownfield sites to preserve green spaces and regenerate the urban \ncore in order to enhance the quality of life of local residents. An essential element of the city's strategy has been the ecological \nrestoration of the River Ljubljanica, including renovated riverbanks with improved vegetation to create new high-quality \npublic spaces.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2016 the city created more than 90 ha of new public green areas on former brownfield or degraded land. \n(This, among other factors, led to its selection as European Green Capital in 2016.) Today, almost 75 % of the city's surface \narea is green areas. 80 % of the green areas are on the outskirts of the city and are connected to the historical centre by \ngreen wedges and riparian corridors that link city centre parks and gardens. This includes a 34-km-long circular green corridor \npopular for sports and leisure. \n \nSource: Oppla (2021).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n65Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nand are proposing new regulatory interventions that deter \ncar use and incentivise public and active travel. These \nmay include investment in the active travel infrastructure; \nimproved public transport safety and accessibility; changes \nin traffic regulations to increase safety; and pricing policies \nsuch as congestion charges to prevent an increase in \ncar use. For example, Dublin started to develop a 'living' \nframework of mobility proposals along with the National \nTransport Authority. This plan proposes to provide \nadditional space for pedestrian areas and safe cycling \nfacilities (OECD, 2020).\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, many employers are looking at \nnew ways of working, and there is some evidence that the \nidea of a '15-minute city', in which people are able to meet \nall of their daily needs within a short walk or cycle from \ntheir homes, is gaining some traction among policymakers \n(Mart\u00ednez Euklidiadas, 2020). If cities are to embrace this \nmodel of urban proximity, it will require a reconsideration \nof how public and active transport is currently planned. \nIn the longer term, if there is an overall replacement of \nphysical connectivity with more virtual connectivity, this \ncould lead to reductions in the need for travel without \nnecessarily sacrificing accessibility. However, the impact of \nthese changes will is likely to be unequally distributed across \ndifferent population groups, and city governments will have \nto think very carefully about how their recovery policies can \nensure that the most vulnerable groups do not experience \na decline in their accessibility to urban opportunities. To \nhelp policymakers with the long-term sustainable mobility \ntransition, a new foresight project, 'European urban mobility \n\n2050', supported by the EEA, will provide the narratives that \nthey need to make the transition in the right direction.\n\n3.5.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving urban \naccessibility\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThis nexus focuses on coordination between transport policy \n(which determines the transport options available), spatial and \nland use planning (which determines where different services \nand resources are located within the city and relative to one \nanother) and housing policy (which determines questions of \nequity and inclusion), and on the building blocks relevant to \nthese key policy areas (see Table 3.1). Many cities continue to \nstruggle to tackle these interlinked policy areas comprehensively \nand move towards accessibility-based urban development.\n\nExample challenges and actions\n\nEuropean cities face a key challenge in determining how to \nenhance mobility, ensure accessibility and create high-quality \nand efficient transport systems while at the same time reducing \ncongestion, pollution and accidents. Both existing infrastructure \nand existing urban form are likely to be shaped significantly \nby the COVID-19 pandemic. Huge reductions in the use of \npublic transport, renewed investment in walking and cycling \ninfrastructure and, at the same time, an increase in the use \nof private cars will potentially have significant implications for \nenvironmental sustainability and land use change.  \n\nTable 3.4 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving urban accessibility\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Poor spatial, housing and transport planning \npractices including:\n\n\u2022 poor policy integration across  \nsectors and different governance levels (i.e. \nsupranational, national,  \nregional, local)\n\n\u2022 lack of long-term planning and narrow \nfocus on directly addressing demand rather \nthan solving underlying accessibility issues \n(e.g. expanding road capacity rather than \nreducing road use)\n\n\u2022 legacy of outdated spatial, housing and \ntransport planning models\n\n\u2022 Improving alignment of policy frameworks at different governance levels and \nacross sectors to eliminate unintended barriers to urban accessibility.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring a better spatial mix and distribution of economic activities, services \nand amenities at the spatial planning level by clustering new developments, \nincluding housing, around existing transport nodes and routes to promote \ntransit-oriented development (see Box 3.6).\n\n\u2022 Implementing transport, housing and spatial planning policy reforms \n(regulatory, economic, information-based) that recognise that car-based \njourneys in urban areas are the least optimal.\n\n\u2022 Building and expanding high-quality efficient public transport systems and \ninfrastructure that promote active travel.\n\n\u2022 Lack of understanding of the exact meaning of \naccessibility and how to measure it accurately.\n\n\u2022 Lack of recognition that certain groups are \nmore likely to experience accessibility-related \ndisadvantages/have different accessibility needs.\n\n\u2022 Developing clear metrics to measure progress towards achieving accessibility \n(e.g. PTAL, or public transport accessibility level).\n\n\u2022 Agreeing what type of accessibility should be promoted within a city and how \nthis access is distributed across the wider population.\n\n\u2022 Diversifying transport modes as much as possible to ensure that the greatest \nnumber of people can reach the greatest number of destinations in ways that \nmeet their needs.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n66 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that \nhomeworking is a viable alternative to office-based work for \nmany people. As companies begin to rethink the need for \noffice space in urban centres, this could have further impacts \non land use and existing transport networks. Table 3.4 sets out \nsome of the main challenges cities may face in achieving urban \naccessibility and examples of actions that could help to address \nthese challenges.\n\nBox 3.6 presents an example of an interlinked area of \npolicymaking and action relevant to achieving urban \naccessibility. The example focuses on the establishment \nof transit-oriented development (TOD) to help to reduce \npassenger travel demand and promote compact urban \ndevelopment. TOD can take many different forms and  \ncan be adapted by cities to suit their context and needs.  \nThe transport infrastructure can be retrofitted to improve the \naccessibility of existing high-density developments. It can also \nbe used to encourage densification around existing stations \nor to encourage new urban developments. Box 3.7 presents \na case study of using TOD to develop new neighbourhoods in \nCopenhagen (Denmark).\n\n3.5.3 Lessons for achieving urban accessibility\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the urban \naccessibility nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 Policies that explicitly aim to achieve better accessibility \naddress a multitude of interlinked urban challenges. These \ngo far beyond the environmental burden of excessive \n\nmotorised transport in cities and have the potential to \nfundamentally reconfigure how we live, work and interact \nwith each other. Implementing transport policy reforms that \npromote walking, cycling, public transport and other forms \nof sustainable mobility can play an important role.  \nHowever, these need to be linked to spatial planning and \nhousing policies to achieve real urban accessibility.\n\n\u2022 Defining and measuring accessibility currently presents a \nchallenge. It can mean different things to different people, \nand accessibility disadvantages are likely to affect some \nsocial groups more than others, something that was \nhighlighted very clearly by the COVID-19 pandemic. To be \ntruly effective, equity and social inclusion must be central \nto any policy responses. This will ensure that the move \ntowards greater accessibility does not come at the expense \nof the most vulnerable urban residents.\n\n\u2022 To ensure equality, city governments need to agree what \ntype of accessibility should be promoted and how this \naccess should be distributed across society.\n\n\u2022 A lack of integration and collaboration across the different \ngovernance levels (i.e. national, regional, local) and policy \nsectors that characterise this nexus can lead to wide-ranging \nsocio-economic and environmental costs and challenges \n(e.g. urban sprawl, congestion, poor road safety) and  \ncan be an obstacle to accessibility-based planning.  \nHowever, sector-specific actions can be implemented  \nto advance urban accessibility without fundamental  \nreform of the policymaking process or of existing \ninstitutional arrangements.\n\nBox 3.6 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: increasing urban density through transit-oriented \ndevelopment\n\nUrban density and mixed use tends to be strongly correlated with greater accessibility; however, it is not without its \ndetractors. If not carefully managed, greater urban density can lead to increased traffic congestion and air pollution, \naccelerate gentrification and increase house prices, thus exacerbating urban inequalities (Salat and Ollivier, 2017;  \nDingil et al., 2018). It can also reduce access to urban green spaces, which are essential for human health and well-being \n(Kabisch et al., 2015), provide space for nature and have a role in managing climate risks. Liveable urban density therefore \nrelies on the concurrent development of excellent public and active transport infrastructures, as well as social policies  \nthat pre-empt urban inequalities.\n\nThere is a range of policy responses that can promote urban density. Transit-oriented development (TOD) builds on  \nthe well-established European precedent of concentrating urban development along railway lines, metro routes and other \npublic transport routes (e.g. trams, buses). At its heart is the idea that transport, land use and economic growth can all \nbe managed more efficiently if planned in an integrated way (Salat and Ollivier, 2017). This is because high-quality public \ntransport and compact urban development mutually reinforce each other. Mass transit can support the large passenger \nnumbers that come with high-density development, while the concentration of jobs and housing around stations helps \nmake public transport financially viable.\n\nWell-managed TOD measures can create important co-benefits, such as relieving congestion and shifting to more \nsustainable transport modes, improving air quality, boosting economic growth, improving the quality of places and \nincreasing physical activity levels.\n\nSource: Gouldson et al. (2018); Linton and Bray (2019).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n67Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.7 Example of transit-oriented development: developing new neighbourhoods in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nCopenhagen developed \u00d8restad new town on a strategic piece of reclaimed land owned jointly by the city (55 %) and the \nDanish government (45 %). The city government identified the area between the city boundary and the bridge connecting \nCopenhagen to Malm\u00f6 in Sweden as suitable for high-density housing. \u00d8restad is designed to be highly accessible by public \ntransport and bicycle. Car parking within \u00d8restad is restricted for both residents and visitors and is largely confined to \nmulti-storey car parks. The \u00d8restad Development Corporation created a masterplan and provided critical infrastructure, \nincluding the new Copenhagen metro, before selling plots along the line to developers. The finance captured from land \nsales was then used to pay for a significant chunk of the metro's development.\n\n\u00d8restad has helped to improve Copenhagen's international competitiveness by expanding its so called Copenhagen \nBusiness District and developing highly accessible sites for office, media, retail and leisure activities. The large investment \nin mass transport infrastructure in the central parts of Greater Copenhagen has increased its accessibility and encouraged \ncommuting from a much wider area, including more than 20 000 commuters a day from the Malm\u00f6 area. (This is an interesting \nexample of a case in which better accessibility has led to an increase in overall transport demand, which will have to be \nstudied further to see if the benefits of greater accessibility outweigh the costs of the increased number of trips).\n\nSource: Knowles (2012).\n\n\u2022 The extent to which cities can effectively implement \naccessibility policies will depend on the specific institutional \nand governance context and the overall decision-making \npowers that have been devolved to them. This can vary \nsignificantly from one EU country to another and even \nbetween cities (e.g. large capitals sometimes have more \ndecision-making powers than other cities in the country).\n\n\u2022 The EU faces significant limitations in developing overarching \npolicies on spatial and urban planning, as land use policies \nare mostly a national, regional or local competence.\n\n\u2022 The EU's limited role in spatial and urban planning presents \na challenge for achieving greater policy coherence around \naccessibility at the EU level. However, the EU can play \nan important role in several ways, such as developing \nstandards and guidelines on public transport access \nrequirements for new developments, stipulating desirable \nurban densities, and promoting knowledge sharing and \npeer-to-peer exchange.\n\n\u2022 Cities will require an agile regulatory environment that \ncan proactively respond to rapid changes, such as new \ndisruptive technologies from automation to smart mobility, \nto ensure that these enhance urban accessibility rather than \nundermine it.\n\n\u2022 Addressing the urban accessibility nexus requires new \ncross-sectoral metrics, analysis and appraisal methods and \nthe introduction of standardised measurement indicators.\n\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need \nfor city governments to rethink their transport policies to \nchange the focus from mobility to accessibility. By investing \nin TOD and active transport infrastructure, cities can \nbuild resilience to future pandemics while also ensuring \nsignificant environmental and health benefits.\n\n3.6 Environment and health nexus\n\n3.6.1 What is environment and health and why is it \nimportant in an urban context?\n\nUrban areas are often unhealthy places to live, characterised \nby heavy traffic, pollution and noise. In 2013 the European \nCommission introduced the clean air policy package to reduce \nthe health and environmental impacts of air pollution by 2030 \n(EC, 2021b). With the urban mobility package, the European \nCommission reiterated measures to address these issues  \n(EC, 2020b).\n\nHuman health is closely linked to the state of the environment. \nAlthough emissions of air pollutants have declined in recent \nyears, almost 20 % of the EU's urban population lives in areas \nwhere air pollutant concentrations exceed at least one EU air \nquality standard (EEA, 2019a). Noise pollution is also a major \nenvironmental health concern in cities, especially from road \ntraffic (EEA, 2019e, 2019g). For example, regular exposure to \nnoise pollution can trigger elevated blood pressure and heart \nattacks and causes approximately 12 000 premature deaths \neach year in Europe (EC, 2015c; EEA, 2018d, 2019c, 2019e).  \nAn estimated 82 million people in European cities are  \nexposed to noise levels in excess of 55 dB from traffic during \nthe day-evening-night period (EEA, 2019e). Furthermore, light \npollution in urban areas affects both flora and fauna as well \nas human health (Falchi et al., 2011; \u0160kvareninov\u00e1 et al., 2017; \nCoogan et al., 2020). Exposure to environmental stressors  \n(e.g. air, noise and light pollution) differs among social groups \nin cities. As a result, the health of some groups (e.g. low-income \ngroups and ethnic and racial minorities) is more affected by the \nstate of the urban environment than others (Brulle et al.,\u00a02006; \nEEA, 2014, 2018a). This is due to the unequal distribution, \nquality and maintenance of urban infrastructures and services, \nsuch as transport systems and high-quality green spaces \n(Barnes et al., 2018).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n68 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nIn addition, the quality and accessibility of urban green \nspaces are considered important elements of healthy urban \ncommunities (Bertram and Rehdanz, 2015; Edwards and \nDulai,\u00a02018; EEA, 2019c). The COVID-19 pandemic has also \nshown the positive impact of green spaces on people's \nphysical and mental health. These dimensions can be \naddressed through urban design and policies related to public \ntransport, walking and cycling infrastructure. Together these \ncan contribute to improvements in environmental quality, \nhuman health and social equity and justice issues. Achieving \nhigh-quality urban environments that enhance the health of all \ncitizens should thus be a priority for urban policymakers.\n\nIf environment and health is improved in cities this is likely  \nto support progress in other priority nexuses, in particular \n'quality of life', through planning and measures to improve  \nGI and prioritise access and multifunctionality to enable active \ntransport; and 'climate resilience', through the creation and \nenhancement of green areas that can incorporate measures  \nto manage climate impacts and extreme weather events.\n\nThe environment and health nexus and the COVID-19 \npandemic\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of environmental \nquality in cities for people's physical and mental health. For example, \ncontinued exposure to poor air quality leads to increased risk \nof mortality from respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. The \nstrict travel restrictions imposed across European cities during \nthe height of the lockdown led to a significant reduction in \nmotorised traffic. This reduction had an immediate and positive \nimpact on air quality, with emissions from cars and motorcycles \nfalling by 88 % compared with pre-pandemic levels (EEA, 2020c;  \nOECD, 2020). However, the easing of some COVID-19 restrictions \nin late summer 2020 saw air and noise pollution levels rebound  \nacross European cities (EEA, 2020d). The need for social distancing \nto reduce the risks of spreading COVID-19 meant that public \ntransport systems were either closed or running at limited capacity.\n\nThe pandemic has provided cities with an opportunity \nto reconsider mobility with an emphasis on active travel, \nimproved local environments and human health benefits. In \ntheir pandemic recovery plans many cities have proposed \nlong-term and permanent strategies including investment in \nactive mobility infrastructures; improved public transport safety \nand accessibility; changes in traffic regulations to increase \n\nsafety; and pricing policies, such as congestion charges. Public \ngreen spaces should play a key role in the green recovery. \nLocal policymakers need to prioritise the provision of safe and \naccessible green space, especially in areas of deprivation or \nwhere there is poor or unequal access.\n\n3.6.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving improved \nenvironment and health in cities\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThere are many important policy areas that can contribute \nto improvements in the environment and human health in \ncities. Given their relative importance for human health, this \nnexus focuses on the need for coordinated policy related to \ntransport, GI and environment, and on the building blocks \nrelevant to these key policy areas (see Table 3.1). There can \nalso be important trade-offs and co-benefits between these \npolicy areas, for example using GI to create safe active transport \ncorridors can help reduce congestion, ease environmental \npollution and provide space for nature.\n\nImproving environment and health in cities is a \nmultidimensional challenge. It requires above all coordinating \naction on air quality, mobility and access and the quantity and \nquality of green spaces, among other things. Table 3.5 sets out \nsome of the main challenges that cities may face in achieving \nimproved environment and health and gives examples of \nactions that could help to address these challenges.\n\nBox 3.8 presents an example of an interlinked area of \npolicymaking and action relevant to improving environment and \nhealth in cities. The example focuses on the establishment of \npolicies that support car-free cities to improve urban air quality. \nAs shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, measures reducing \ntraffic congestion in urban areas have had notable impacts \non air quality. Reduced traffic can also reduce emissions of \ngreenhouse gases such as CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  \nCar-free cities have the potential to create multiple co-benefits \nfor both the environment and human health. The pandemic \nhas provided cities with an opportunity to reconsider mobility \nwith an emphasis on active travel, improved local environments \nand human health benefits. Box 3.9 presents a case study of \nencouraging sustainable mobility habits to reduce air pollution \nin Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Barcelona (Spain).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n69Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nTable 3.5 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving improved environment and health in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Lack of cross-cutting and coordinated \npolicy approaches that consider mobility, \naccess, green spaces and air quality, \namong others, together.\n\n\u2022 Working across policy areas, in particular transport/mobility, land \nuse planning (especially for green spaces), nature/environment, air \nquality, health and equality to achieve coordinated outcomes and \nco-benefits.\n\n\u2022 Adapting existing policies to create co-benefits and improve human \nhealth in cities, e.g. GI can be planned to contribute to climate \nresilience and food security.\n\n\u2022 Poor existing urban design and form, \nwhich limits options for or provides little \nspace for active transport, community and \ngreen space.\n\n\u2022 Redesigning urban form and space to improve GI and prioritise \nmultiple uses, including environmental quality and active \ntransport but also social meeting places and areas for biodiversity \nconservation.\n\n\u2022 Current unsustainable transport patterns, \nespecially dominance of motorised \ntransport (cars) even for short journeys  \nand commuting.\n\n\u2022 Existing infrastructure that does not \nsupport or enable active travel.\n\n\u2022 Introducing policies that reduce car use/motorised traffic (e.g. improved \nfrequency and availability of public transport, subsidised public \ntransport and incentives for cyclists, reducing speed limits, \nrestricting access and reallocating road space) and promote active \ntransport to reduce air and noise pollution (see Box 3.8).\n\n\u2022 Promoting teleworking to reduce the number of people commuting \nto work during the busiest periods of the day.\n\n\u2022 High levels of social inequality: vulnerable \ncommunities, including ethnic and racial \nminorities, experience higher rates \nof morbidity and mortality due to the \ncumulative effects of exposure to \nenvironmental stressors; and more \ndeprived populations often have poorer \naccess to and lower quality GI in their \nvicinity than groups with higher incomes.\n\n\u2022 Working with community groups and citizens to ensure that the needs of \nall are considered and to collaboratively create policy and interventions.\n\n\u2022 Focusing action to create and enhance GI in areas of economic and social \ndeprivation seeking to ensure equality of access in all areas of the city.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring monitoring of environmental drivers of health outcomes \n(e.g. air quality, noise, access to green space) also includes social and \neconomic equality measures.\n\nBox 3.8 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: improving air quality through car-free cities\n\nOver 400 000 premature deaths each year in the EU are linked to air pollution (EEA, 2019e), and the health impact of road \ntraffic emissions alone cost EUR 67-80 billion a year (CE Delft, 2018). The EU-funded ClimateCost study on the costs and \nbenefits of the adverse economic, health and environmental impacts of air pollution calculates that the annual air quality \nco-benefit in the EU-27 in 2050 under a 2 \u00b0C (mitigation) scenario falls within the range of EUR 44-95 billion. Most sources \nof outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals. Improving air quality demands concerted action by local, \nnational and regional policymakers working in sectors such as transport, energy and urban planning (WHO, 2018).\n\nIn relation to transport, a wide portfolio of policies is needed to support car-free cities. These include improved frequency \nand availability of public transport, infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, shared car and bicycle programmes, and \naccess for emergency vehicles and delivery trucks. Cities can provide incentives and build capacities among business \nstart-ups and community-based innovation projects that enable ride sharing or alternative modes of transport. However, \npolicies must be carefully considered. The popularity of electric scooters in European cities has demonstrated that some \nalternative forms of transport can raise both environmental and safety concerns (Tapper, 2019).\n\nSome cities have subsidised public transport, and others have established incentives for cyclists. Another policy option is \nto promote teleworking, which involves working remotely and reducing the number of people commuting to work during \nthe busiest periods of the day. However, initiatives that promote car-free cities may be contested by businesses and \ninterest groups who feel that it will put particular sectors at an economic disadvantage. Car-free cities may also be opposed \nby those who are sceptical of policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. An emphasis on co-benefits is thus \nimportant \u2014 this includes human health (EEA, 2018c).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n70 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.9 Example of a car-free city: encouraging sustainable mobility habits to reduce air pollution in Cornell\u00e0 de \nLlobregat, Barcelona, Spain\n\nAir pollution is one of the main public health problems in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, where Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat \nis located. This issue is mainly caused by motorised traffic. In 2016, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat municipality, in collaboration \nwith the \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Barcelona, launched the Cornell\u00e0 Natura project, which shaped the city's strategic plan \nfor\u00a02016-2026. The project aims to increase and improve green areas in the municipality and encourage sustainable \nmobility habits to improve urban liveability by 2026. It focuses on three main goals that provide the focus for all \ninterventions:\n\n\u2022 achieve a green municipal infrastructure;\n\n\u2022 promote sustainable mobility;\n\n\u2022 improve environmental quality.\n\nMany of the actions promoted within the project are aimed at reducing air pollution levels and encouraging sustainable \nmobility habits. For example, these include reducing the speed limit to 20-30 km/h, traffic restrictions during weekends \nand the expansion of the bicycle lane network. A key objective is to have more than 50 % of all journeys made on foot or by \nbicycle by 2026, with public transport accounting for another 30 %.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation of some of the actions within the project. The initial \nlockdowns enabled the municipality to test closing streets to traffic and improving the public transport service. These \nmeasures have now been consolidated and new streets will be calmed by increasing the green infrastructure and creating \nmore space for pedestrians.\n\nSource: EC, 2019b.\n\n3.6.3 Lessons for improving environment and health in \ncities\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the \nenvironment and health nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 While urbanisation has contributed to an overall decline \nin poverty (subsequently improving human health), some \nenvironmental challenges (e.g. air, noise, light pollution) put \nthe health of people in cities at risk (Chen et al., 2019). As \nshown by the COVID-19 pandemic, a better understanding \nof the linkages, dynamics and complexities of urban \nenvironments is needed (InterAcademy Partnership, 2021).\n\n\u2022 Policies must prioritise both people's health and the  \nquality of the environment. Strategies for sustainable urban \ndevelopment must therefore recognise people as part of \nthe environmental system.\n\n\u2022 National legislative frameworks should encourage local \nauthorities to better integrate transport within their health \nand environment policies (Flausch, 2016).\n\n\u2022 Cities have a key role in improving environment and health \nthrough coordinated policy actions. For example, local authorities \n should seek to implement effective policy to reduce the use \nof cars through the provision of public and active transport \noptions (and actions to encourage their use and discourage \ncar use), creating multifunctional spaces and improving GI.\n\n\u2022 Many of the measures required to improve the \nenvironment and health in cities depends on collaboration \nacross diverse stakeholder groups. In particular it is \nimportant to foster the participation and inclusion of \ndeprived, low-income and minority groups, who are often \nmost exposed to environmental stressors, and reach a \nmulti-stakeholder consensus.\n\n\u2022 The articulation of co-benefits is critical to reaching a \nconsensus across diverse stakeholder groups on measures \nto reduce the use of cars and improve GI and the \nenvironment in cities.\n\n\u2022 Good-quality urban green spaces can provide a restorative \nenvironment to mitigate the impacts of urban stressors \nsuch as air and noise pollution (Payne and Bruce, 2019). \nWhen multiplied by the thousands of people who use it, \ngreen space can have a large positive impact on public \nhealth (Gilbert, 2016).\n\n\u2022 Indicators that capture the quality of human-environment \nconnections can provide a good picture of human health \nin cities, especially when combined with indicators of \ndeprivation and inequality.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for \ncities to reimagine the way their infrastructure supports the \nenvironment and health for all. By investing in infrastructure \nthat encourages active transport and improves access to green \n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n71Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nspace, cities can contribute to a green recovery and achieve \nmultiple co-benefits for both the environment and human \nhealth.\n\n3.7 Food security nexus\n\n3.7.1 What is food security and why is it important in \nan urban context?\n\nFood security is defined as all individuals at all times having \nphysical, social and economic access to safe, sufficient and \nnutritious food (FAO, 2003). It also refers to the ability of \na nation to provide such access for its people, through its \nfood production systems, self-sufficiency and stable trade \nagreements and networks.\n\nThe demand for food and evolving tastes (e.g. for out-of-season \nproduce) in cities has outgrown the capacity of their hinterlands \nto supply it. As a result, reliance on imported food continues \nto grow. Any disturbance (e.g. climate risks, food prices, \npandemics) to these supply chains could lead to social \ninequality in terms of access to affordable nutritious food \nin cities. Food security is an urban policy issue as much as a \nnational and rural one. Yet, European policy to date has not \nhad a transformative effect on urban agriculture and food \nsecurity, as it mainly views food production as a rural activity. \nFor example, food system initiatives in cities are not eligible for \ncommon agricultural policy funding (De Schutter et al., 2019).\n\nEnhanced urban food security can reduce the environmental \nfootprint of the increasing demand for food. It can also \ndecrease reliance on external food provisioning systems and \nimports. Both issues are critical in the context of climate change \nand any future pandemics.\n\nIf enhanced food security is achieved in cities, this can help to \nsupport progress in other priority nexuses, in particular 'quality \nof life', through ensuring access to healthy, fresh and affordable \nfood for all; 'environment and health', through measures supporting \nurban food production and changes in people's diets; and \n'closing the loop', through improving the management of food \nwaste in households and service industries.\n\nThe food security nexus and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased awareness of the nature \nand vulnerability of the food system and food production, \nsupply and distribution chains. The initial responses to \nCOVID-19 caused significant disruption to food systems, \nincluding in urban areas. This posed several challenges, \nincluding, rapid changes in food demand, availability, \naccessibility and affordability. During the height of the \npandemic many supermarket shelves across European cities \n\nwere empty because of spikes in demand and a reliance on \nlong and complex supply chains and just-in-time delivery. \nClosed borders, grounded planes, missing ship containers \nand a reduced workforce led to disruption in supply chains, \nparticularly for fresh produce (EC, 2020c). In some communities \nand households, there was a shift away from supermarkets \ntowards local, small scale provision/self-sufficiency in certain \ngoods and services, including food.\n\nFor example, Paris (France) is planning to produce more of \nits food locally. The aim is to reduce the average distance \ntravelled by food from producer to consumer, which is \ncurrently 660 km. In Valencia (Spain), there are plans to use \nthe urban green belt as an immediate and direct source \nof fresh food for the city (OECD, 2020). There is a risk that \nthose from lowest income households will not be able to \nafford locally grown and organic food, as it tends to be \nmore expensive than food found in supermarkets. The \npandemic-induced economic recession is also likely to have an \nimpact on vulnerable households, further reducing their ability \nto purchase healthy, nutritious and locally grown food.\n\nIn their green recovery plans, city governments could plan \nfor a diversity of green spaces, including urban agriculture. \nThis could have several co-benefits, for example increased \nbiodiversity, a reduced urban heat island effect and a reduced \nrisk of flooding and soil erosion (OECD, 2020). However, \nthere may also be trade-offs with other land uses, such as for \nhousing or commercial development, requiring coordinated \npolicy and action.\n\n3.7.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving food \nsecurity in cities\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThe food security in cities nexus focuses on coordination \nof policymaking and action in relation to urban food, waste \nmanagement and spatial planning, and on the building blocks \nrelevant to these key policy areas (see Table 3.1). A lack of \ncoordination between these three policy areas may constrain \nsecure and sufficient access to food for the growing urban \npopulation today and in the future.\n\nUrban areas are not immune to impacts on food systems, \nsuch as the impacts of climate change. This can affect all of the \nelements of urban food systems, including food distribution \nand supply chains, transport and food storage. The COVID-19 \npandemic has also highlighted the vulnerability of these \nelements, particularly of the production, supply and distribution \nchains. Table 3.6 sets out some of the main challenges of \nenhancing food security in cities and gives examples of actions \nthat could help to address these challenges.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n72 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.10 presents an example of an interlinked area of \npolicymaking and action relevant to achieving food security in \ncities. The example focuses on the establishment of small-scale \ninnovation projects to promote urban agriculture in cities. While \nthere are no definitive figures for the percentage of food grown \nin urban areas across Europe, individual case studies suggest a \nsignificant potential. Such projects can also have environmental \nbenefits, including increased biodiversity, a reduced 'urban heat \nisland effect' and a reduced risk of flooding and soil erosion.  \nAs a result of the pandemic, more municipal and city authorities \nare realising the value of growing local, organic and more \nseasonal food (e.g. fruit and vegetables) in and around urban \nareas (EC, 2020d; iPES, 2020). Box 3.11 presents a case study  \nof urban farming in Berlin (Germany).\n\n3.7.3 Lessons for achieving food security in cities\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the food \nsecurity nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 It is essential that awareness of how climate change will \naffect the various interlinked elements of food systems is \nbuilt into all policy decisions and actions.\n\n\u2022 Food security is closely linked to urban climate resilience; \nthus, urban food production, land use and waste \nprogrammes must be aligned with urban adaptation \nstrategies.\n\n\u2022 Achieving food security will require cooperation between  \na wide range of stakeholders (e.g. policymakers, producers, \ndistributors, retailers and consumers), including the \ndifferent cultural groupings and age cohorts that make  \nup urban populations.\n\n\u2022 A shift towards more integrated perspectives on urban \nfood systems will also require cooperation between a \nwide range of sectors and interests, including health and \neducation, transport and logistics, disaster and emergency \nmanagement, urban food networks for the urban poor, \nfood infrastructure and greening local economies.\n\n\u2022 Urban food security requires a cross-policy response related \nto several EU policy areas including agriculture, fisheries \nand food, business, sustainable development, climate \naction, employment and social rights, energy and natural \nresources, environment, consumers and health, regional \nand local development, and science and technology.\n\nTable 3.6 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving food security in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Low level of resilience of urban food \nsystems to various impacts, including \nfrom climate change and a growing urban \npopulation.\n\n\u2022 Over-reliance on external food supplies.\n\n\u2022 Increasing urban agricultural production using practices ranging \nfrom household and community gardens to rooftop, vertical and \nindoor farms.\n\n\u2022 Establish initiatives to promote urban agriculture through \nsmall-scale innovation projects (see Box 3.10).\n\n\u2022 Lack of fair access to nutritious food, \nparticularly among low-income \ncommunities.\n\n\u2022 Lack of understanding of how the \nvalues and attitudes of all stakeholders \ncan influence both the design and the \nimplementation of food systems.\n\n\u2022 Engaging citizens and stakeholders in land use planning to ensure \nthat space is available for, and communities are engaged in, local \nfood growing initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Promoting urban community gardening and farming projects to,  \nfor example, help new immigrants and refugees build social ties  \nand increase community cohesion.\n\n\u2022 Working with the private sector (e.g. supermarkets, local \nconvenience shops, food distributors), non-governmental \norganisations/charities, community groups and citizens to \nunderstand food access challenges and encourage the provision  \nof affordable, healthy and fresh food in all areas.\n\n\u2022 Encouraging and supporting local food cooperatives and community \nshops in low-income communities and deprived areas.\n\n\u2022 Reducing food waste. \u2022 Providing incentives and building capacity among start-ups and \ncommunity-based innovation projects to reduce food waste.\n\n\u2022 Promoting innovative solutions for the redistribution of surplus food \nsupplies within urban areas, including by using technology.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n73Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.10 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: promoting urban agriculture through small-scale \ninnovation projects\n\nThere are growing opportunities for cities to provide incentives and build capacity among start-ups and community-based \nfood-related innovation projects. Many cities have set up their own systems to support the development of urban \nagriculture as part of wider circular economy and resilience-building initiatives (GIZ and ICLEI, 2014). Based on an analysis \nof land use, Rome is the most agricultural municipality in Europe. One of the best urban agricultural practices there is the \nmultifunctional agricultural cooperative Agricoltura Nuova. It occupies some 250 ha and sells all of its food directly to local \nmarkets. The cooperative is also involved in the social integration of marginalised individuals (Cavallo et al., 2016).\n\nThere are various factors that influence the viability of expanding urban agriculture through small-scale innovation \nprojects. Some of these include the climate, existing urban layout, attitudes towards the use of urban space for food \nproduction, and the wider policy and institutional set-up.\n\nUrban agriculture does not require large amounts of land, as vacant plots or disused land can often be brought back into \nuse. However, there might be trade-offs with other land uses, such as for housing or business development in response \nto increasing urban populations. It can also be integrated into existing parks and private gardens. This can also improve \nbiodiversity and local amenity value. Even in dense urban areas with limited green space, rooftops or vertical structures can \nsupport food production. This would require the right set-up and support from technologies such as hydroponics.\n\nBox 3.11 Example of a small-scale innovation project: urban farming in Berlin, Germany\n\nECF Farmsystems is a 1 800 m2 aquaponic start-up in Berlin's central Sch\u00f6neberg district producing 30 tonnes of fish \n(tilapia) and 400 000 basil plants each year. The founders have created a symbiotic system in which basil plants are grown \nfrom seed using nutrient-rich water filtered from the fish-farming tanks using bacteria.\n\nThe system avoids the usual use of pesticides in the basil production and antibiotics in the fish production. An added \nbenefit is that 90 % of water is reused. Shorter transport distances for the fish and basil result in fresher food and lower \nemissions, especially because of the reduced need for refrigeration. Start-up finance of EUR 1.4 million came from private \ninvestors and the Investitionsbank Berlin, a state-owned development bank. The business employs three gardeners and \ntwo fish farmers and has a contract to supply basil to the Rewe supermarket chain throughout Germany.\n\nSource: Rosenbach (2019).\n\n\u2022 Urban authorities have a crucial role in the design  \nand implementation of urban food policies, including  \nin reconnecting food producers and consumers and  \ninvolving different local actors at different scales to  \nco-create innovative solutions (Magarini et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the \ndisproportionate impact of food availability,  \naccessibility and affordability on socially and  \neconomically disadvantaged groups. As part of  \ntheir green recovery planning, city governments can  \nhelp address food security by expanding urban  \nagriculture, introducing 'zero-waste' food systems  \nand implementing measures that ensure accessible  \nand affordable food for all.\n\n3.8 Closing the loop nexus\n\n3.8.1 What is closing the loop and why is it important \nin an urban context?\n\nClosing the loop refers to a circular model of resource \nmanagement. It means keeping products, materials, built assets \nand land in use while maintaining their value. It also means \nminimising waste generation. Current, predominantly linear \n(take-make-dispose), consumption and production patterns \nare unsustainable. Recognising this, in 2015 the European \nCommission adopted Closing the loop \u2014 An EU action plan for the \ncircular economy (EC, 2015d). Partnership on a circular economy \nis also one of 12 thematic partnerships under the urban agenda \nfor the EU (EC, 2016a).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n74 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nAround three quarters of Europeans live in cities (EEA, 2019a). \nAs a result, most of Europe's production meets demand originating \nin cities, as they are major consumers of resources and products.  \nUrban areas depend on land and production outside their \nboundaries to meet resource needs and dispose of their waste. \nAt the same time environmental and social problems associated \nwith the linear economy are focused in urban areas.\n\nMajor disruptions in supply chains due to the COVID-19 \npandemic have highlighted the importance of keeping \nresources within the value chain, minimising waste and \nmaximising reuse and repair. Closing the loop can 'decrease \nour reliance on imports and \u2026reduce environmental pressures' \n(EEA, 2019a), including in cities. Cities can benefit from the \ncircular economy and, given their environmental and economic \nimportance, act as 'centres for change' (Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation and ARUP, 2019).\n\nAs closing the loop is a high-level objective, progress towards \ncircular economy cities would imply progress in some of the \nother example nexuses, in particular 'sustainable buildings', \nthrough better management of construction waste and \nresource and material use in construction (e.g. reuse); and \n'clean energy', through the development of systems where \nwaste energy is reused and clean energy is generated at  \na small scale to meet local energy demands.\n\nThe closing the loop nexus and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of supply chain \nresilience. At the height of the COVID-19-induced lockdowns \nmany businesses across European cities were negatively \naffected because of their reliance on long and complex supply \nchains and just-in-time delivery. This has led to increased \ninterest in local goods and services, which may support more \ncircular production and consumption (e.g. making reuse of \npackaging easier and encouraging industrial ecology). There is \na risk of social impacts, however, as low-income households \nmay be less able to afford locally sourced and produced \ngoods, because they tend to be more expensive than those \nprovided by global supply chains. The pandemic has also puts \nextra pressure on waste management and recycling systems \nand practices and may lead to inappropriate and illegal waste \nmanagement activities (Adyel, 2020) caused by, for example, \nthe closure of recycling centres, an increase in home clearances, \n\nand an increase in plastic waste from personal protective \nequipment, take-away meals and home-delivered groceries.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided cities with an opportunity \nto put the circular economy at the centre of a green recovery. \nBy favouring short supply chains, designing out waste \nand keeping products and materials in use, it could create \nopportunities for economic growth that also restore the \nenvironment, create jobs and benefit society. To be inclusive, \nrecovery planning needs to understand and address existing \nsocial inequalities within local communities and ensure that the \nneeds of the most vulnerable are met. The long-term effects \non other aspects of consumer behaviour that effect the circular \neconomy remain unclear. For example, there may be continued \nresistance to the concept of using products as a service and \nsharing certain goods (due to real or perceived risks), which \ncould undermine some efforts to encourage circularity.\n\n3.8.2 Challenges of and actions for closing the loop \nin\u00a0cities\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThe closing the loop nexus focuses on resources and materials, \nwaste management and green economy policy areas, and on \nthe building blocks relevant to these key policy areas (see  \nTable 3.1). Many challenges to closing the loop result from \na lack of coordination between these three policy areas. \nFor example, there is a risk that a waste policy that focuses \non landfill and incineration misses out on opportunities for \ngrowing the green economy by using waste as a resource. \nBy coordinating waste management and green economy \npolicymaking and action, the value of resources can be better \nrecognised and processes established to keep resources and \nmaterials in the value chain. Integrating these policy areas could \nalso have co-benefits, such as through reduced pollution and \ncreating local employment. Challenges to closing the loop in \ncities relate to wider governance of the transition to a circular \neconomy as well as challenges in peri-urban and rural areas, \nwhich often experience the negative externalities of urban \nsustainability (e.g. urban waste, soil contamination). This nexus \nassessment focuses on challenges and actions at the city scale. \nTable 3.7 sets out some of the main challenges that cities may \nface in closing the loop and gives examples of actions that could \nhelp to address these challenges.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n75Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nTable 3.7 Overview of challenges of and actions for closing the loop in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Lack of comprehensive strategies and \nroadmaps for circularity at the city or city \nregion scale.\n\n\u2022 Establishing circular city strategic policy documents or roadmaps. \nSuch roadmaps should be based on an understanding of the local \nand regional contexts to reflect local needs and resources.\n\n\u2022 Engaging citizens, businesses and other stakeholders in setting \nstrategy.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate understanding/addressing \nof the social and behavioural changes \nrequired to shift to more sustainable \nconsumption behaviours.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient investment by businesses in \nindustrial ecology practices for the use of \nsecondary raw materials.\n\n\u2022 Convening cross-sectoral engagement, and encouraging \npartnerships, to catalyse cross-sectoral action.\n\n\u2022 Raising awareness and building capacity among citizens and \nbusinesses.\n\n\u2022 Encouraging industrial symbiosis and ecology and supporting \nbusinesses in integrating industrial wastes or by-products into \nproduction processes, including brokering supply and demand of \nsecondary resources and helping markets for secondary resources \nto develop.\n\n\u2022 Understanding and making use of new \ntechnical knowledge and capacity.\n\n\u2022 Establishing networks to share scientific and applied knowledge in \nthe field of the circular economy.\n\n\u2022 Exploring solutions through practical experimentation (testing \napproaches) and innovation at a small scale before scaling up. \n\n\u2022 Lack of holistic approaches to moving \nfrom 'waste management' to 'resource \nmanagement'. There is a need to focus on \nwaste prevention.\n\n\u2022 Focusing efforts on preventing waste by reducing consumption, \nencouraging repair and reuse and finding uses for and the value of \nwaste as a resource (to the extent that cities can influence this).\n\n\u2022 Understanding resource use characteristics and resource flows by \nmapping resource flows (e.g. quantities, flow rates, owners, quality) \nand monitoring progress towards resource efficiency in the city, with \nthe use of appropriate indicators.\n\n\u2022 Recycling rates remain low due to \ninsufficient administrative capacity, a lack \nof investment in recycling infrastructure \nand limited use of economic instruments \n(e.g. pay-as-you-throw).\n\n\u2022 Overcapacity in infrastructure to treat \nresidual waste represents a technological \nand economic lock-in.\n\n\u2022 Lack of designated facilities to support \nwaste prevention, reuse and repair.\n\n\u2022 Using city-level procurement to influence local markets for \ncircularity, e.g. setting standards and criteria and holding funding \ncompetitions to encourage new ideas, cooperation and innovation, \nas well as focusing on areas where there is the most potential to \ninfluence the market.\n\n\u2022 Redesigning city-level waste management investment, processes and \nstructures to keep resources in the value chain, minimise waste and \nmaximise reuse and repair.\n\n\u2022 Working with communities, civil society or the private sector to set \nup consumer repair and reuse hubs (see Box 3.12).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n76 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.12 presents an example of an interlinked area of \npolicymaking and action relevant to closing the loop in cities. \nThe example focuses on the establishment of urban resource \ncentres to help manage domestic waste more effectively in \ncities. Such centres provide a physical space and facilities \nthat are designed to encourage reuse and repair and provide \neducational opportunities, and they represent spaces in which \ncommunities can come together. They have co-benefits, such \nas providing employment and other local economic benefits \nand reducing the amount of waste going to landfill, which has \nbenefits in terms of reducing pollution. Box 3.13 presents a case \nstudy of urban resource centres established in Oslo (Norway).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presents a risk to the success of such \ncentres, as it has significantly affected consumer behaviour, \nwith hoarding, panic buying and home clearances becoming \nmore prevalent during the height of the lockdowns. The  \nlong-term effects on other aspects of consumer behaviour  \nthat affect the circular economy remain unclear\n\nIndicators for closing the loop in cities\n\nClosing the loop or achieving circularity in cities is a high-level \nobjective and is likely to require a range of indicators.  \nThese will also need to reflect local contexts and priorities.  \nA comprehensive set of proposed indicators for measuring the \ntransition to a circular economy in cities has been developed \nby the thematic Circular Economy Partnership under the \nurban agenda for the EU (EC, 2019c), with 30 indicators in \ntotal proposed. These include a small number of overarching \nindicators and thematic indicators related to production and \nconsumption; waste management; secondary raw materials; \nand competitiveness and innovation. Some cities have also \nexplored circular city indices, for example the Circular City \nAnalysis Framework, being piloted in Porto, Portugal  \n(Cavaleiro de Ferreira and Fuso-Nerini, 2019).\n\n3.8.3 Lessons for closing the loop in cities\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the closing \nthe loop nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 Achieving circularity will require the development of  \nfar-reaching and ambitious strategic plans and \nroadmaps. Many examples of such roadmaps already \nexist. A recent study for the European Economic and \nSocial Committee (EESC, 2019) identified 17 existing \nregional or local (including city level) circular economy \nstrategies in Europe. These could be used by other cities \nas examples to learn from.\n\n\u2022 Implementing a circular economy requires an understanding \nof local context (such as existing industries and materials \nflows) and quite specific, locally relevant actions. In many \nways cities are uniquely suited to taking such actions and \nmaking such changes, and therefore they are well placed  \nto be leaders in the transition to a circular economy.\n\n\u2022 Closing the loop will require cooperation between  \na wide range of sectors and types of stakeholder  \n(e.g. public, private, community). Cities will need to develop \npartnerships and seek new ways of working involving \ncollaboration across the public, private and social sectors.\n\n\u2022 Cities may also need to work with the EU, national and \ninternational partners to explore and implement the \nchanges needed to close the loop (e.g. in relation to value \nchains and fiscal measures), as not all actions needed are \nwithin the jurisdiction of cities.\n\n\u2022 The engagement of citizens is also key, as they are \nconsumers of goods and services and important actors \nin the circular economy (e.g. reusing or recycling). The \nestablishment of consumer repair and reuse hubs is an \nexample of a way of increasing citizen involvement.\n\nCities should take advantage of the circumstances brought \nabout by the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the transition \nto a circular economy. This transition could offer investment \nopportunities that will contribute to ensuring a more \ncompetitive and cleaner post-pandemic recovery.\n\n3.9 Clean energy nexus\n\n3.9.1 What is clean energy and why is important in an \nurban context?\n\nClean energy generally refers to energy from renewable  \nnatural resources, such as wind, water (hydro), sunlight, \ngeothermal heat and tides. Clean energy sources have less \nimpact on the environment throughout their life cycle than their \nconventional counterparts (coal, petroleum, natural gas and \nnuclear energy). Although the share of renewables in EU energy \nproduction reached an all-time high in the first quarter of 2020 \nbecause of the COVID-19 lockdowns, fossil fuels still dominate \nprimary energy production and are a key driver of climate \nchange (IEA, 2020a). In 2019 the European Parliament declared \na climate emergency in Europe to which the transition to clean \nenergy would be a major response. In 2016, the European \nCommission revised the EU's energy policy framework  \nto focus on the transition to clean and fair energy.  \n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n77Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.12 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: reducing waste, encouraging reuse and boosting local \neconomies through 'urban resource centres'\n\nThe role of citizens in the transition to a circular economy in cities is not currently adequately addressed (Circular Economy \nPartnership, 2018b). At the same time prevention is the highest priority in the European waste hierarchy, yet it is rarely \nintegrated into local waste strategies.\n\nTo enhance citizens' involvement in the circular economy, one solution is the creation of urban resource centres (see figure \nbelow from EC, 2019c). Urban resource centres are designated multifunctional places where waste prevention, repair and \nreuse can be promoted and put into practice (Circular Economy Partnership, 2018b). \n\n\u2022 The centres provide facilities and enhance the capacity for the reuse and repair of materials and goods that otherwise would \nend up as waste. This requires better coordination of the resources and materials and waste management policy areas.\n\n\u2022 The centres also generate local economic benefits, for example by creating employment and serving as 'incubators' for \nsocial enterprises. This requires coordinating the waste management and resources and materials policy areas with \npolicies to promote a green urban economy.\n\nCoordination of these policy areas by establishing urban resource centres can also result in co-benefits for communities \nand authorities by providing hubs for activities, awareness raising and training.\n\nBox 3.13 Example of urban resource centres: mini-recycling stations in Oslo, Norway\n\nTen 'mini-recycling stations' have been established in Oslo, managed by the Agency for Waste Management, and \nfocusing on waste reduction, reuse, repair and recycling. They aim to improve the quality of residual household waste by \nencouraging people to dispose of larger waste articles at these mini-stations. The stations are located centrally (in densely \npopulated areas and accessible by walking and cycling).\n\nThe stations provide opportunities for people to participate in repair workshops, sale and exchange days and waste \nprevention activities. They include space for people to leave items and also to take reusable items for free. In some areas of \nthe city the mini-stations have become 'social arenas' for local communities.\n\nThe mini-recycling stations have contributed to increasing the overall level of reuse in the city. In 2018, 1 499 tonnes of \nreusable goods were exchanged at the centres.\n\nSource: EC (2019c).\n\nIncubator\nCo-creation\nTransforming Industrial sector\n\nURBAN\nRESOURCE\nCENTRES\n\nJob creation\nEngaging community\nQuality of life\n\nECONOMICAL FUNCTIONS\n\nSOCIAL FUNCTIONS\n\nWaste prevention\nWaste management\n2nd raw materials\n\nENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTIONS\n\n\u20ac\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n78 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nAs part of this transition, the clean energy for all Europeans \npackage includes various elements related to the EU's \ntargets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (EC, 2019d). \nThe Commission refers to this as a 'new energy rulebook' \nwhich is fundamental to the implementation of the Energy \nUnion Strategy adopted in 2015 (EC, 2015e). Supplying clean, \naffordable and secure energy is also one of the cornerstones of \nthe European Green Deal (EC, 2019a).\n\nUrban areas are essential for the transition to clean energy \nproduction and a carbon-neutral economy. They account \nfor\u00a060-80 % of global energy consumption and a similar share \nof CO2 emissions (IRENA, 2016; Sharifi and Yamagata, 2016; \nEC,\u00a02021c).\n\nAchieving the climate goals will require maximising the \ndeployment of clean energy sources. In 2018, renewable energy \naccounted for 18.9 % of energy consumed in the EU-27. This \nrepresented an increase of over six percentage points in just \na decade (Eurostat, 2020b). According to the International \nRenewable Energy Agency it would be cost-effective (41) for the EU \nto reach a 34 % share of renewables in its energy mix by 2030. \nNational- and city-level commitments and implementation are \nessential to achieve this potential (IRENA, 2018).\n\nIf more clean energy is produced in cities, this is likely to \nsupport progress in other example nexuses, in particular \n'climate resilience', through reduction in energy-related \ngreenhouse gas emissions from using clean energy sources; \nand 'environment and health', through reduced air and water \npollution as a result of using clean energy sources.\n\nThe clean energy nexus and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe EU energy sector witnessed a fall in energy demand and \nsupply amid the sharp reduction in air and road transport and \nindustrial activity as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. During \nthe first quarter of 2020 the share of renewables in EU energy \nproduction reached an all-time high, with reduced generation \nfrom coal, gas and nuclear energy (IEA, 2020a). Although these \ntrends indicate that EU is likely to meet its 2020 renewable \nenergy target, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the progress  \nof renewable energy projects in the first six months of 2020 \n(IEA, 2020b, 2020c). This trend has also been seen in cities, \nwhere many urban homeowners have been cancelling or \npostponing installation of solar photovoltaic panels and \nrenovation projects. Delays in construction (e.g. due to supply \nchain disruption), lockdown measures and social distancing \nguidelines, as well as financing challenges, have largely been \nresponsible for the limited number of clean energy projects \ncompleted. The pandemic has also had an impact on local \n\nauthorities. The economic challenges facing cities has negatively \naffected the funds available for investment in clean energy. \nIn particular, this has affected the decision-making, granting \nof permits and adoption of spatial planning arrangements \nthat allow the construction of renewable energy projects \n(McElroy,\u00a02020).\n\nIn their green recovery plans, city governments acknowledge \nthe need for investments in clean energy to reinvigorate local \neconomies. For example, the mayors of the C40 Cities network \nhave launched a green and just COVID-19 recovery plan. One \nof the key actions proposed in this plan is to invest in urban \nrenewable energy programmes (C40 Cities, 2020a). The next \ngeneration EU recovery package is also prioritising investment \nin cleaner technologies, including those for generating energy. \nThe green recovery investment in clean energy sources can  \nalso provide good value for money. The impact on local  \nenergy initiatives will depend on cities' approach to recovery. \nCities choosing to focus on community-based recovery,  \nself-sufficiency and the social economy could increase  \ninterest in community energy schemes.\n\n3.9.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving the clean \nenergy transition in cities \n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThis nexus focuses on the need for coordinated policymaking \nand action in cities related to spatial planning, the built \nenvironment and energy, and on the building blocks relevant \nto these key policy areas (see Table 3.1). A lack of coordination \nbetween these three policy areas will undermine efforts to \nincrease clean energy production in cities. For example, spatial \nplanning and built environment policies should consider the \nland use and infrastructure requirements for new clean energy \nproduction and transmission. Integrating these policy areas can \nalso have co-benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions, that \nhelp to mitigate climate change and environment and human \nhealth benefits arising from reduced air and water pollution.\n\nFor cities to transition to clean energy and carbon neutrality \nimplies a structural change in energy production, moving away \nfrom fossil fuels. Broadly this could be achieved in two ways \n(either individually or in combination): either by replacing \nexisting large energy plants with clean energy alternatives  \nor by replacing existing large plants with a more decentralised \napproach in which there are many local producers of clean energy.  \nTable 3.8 sets out some of the main challenges cities may face,  \nirrespective of their chosen route to clean energy, and gives \nexamples of actions that could help to address these challenges.\n\n(41) Cost-effectiveness is defined (EC, 2014) as either, for a given outcome (e.g. a percentage reduction in air pollution), minimising the net-present \nvalue of costs or, for a given cost, maximising the relevant outcome(s). In the context of urban environmental sustainability, cost-effectiveness \nalso considers the co-benefits of an intervention (e.g. the health benefits of meeting a primary objective of reduced air pollution).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n79Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nTable 3.8 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving a clean energy transition in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 The considerable initial investment in clean \nand decentralised energy systems needed, in \nparticular for those cities with ageing energy \ninfrastructures.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient infrastructure to connect clean \nenergy plants to the main grid.\n\n\u2022 Switching from fossil fuel energy producers to clean energy producers.\n\n\u2022 Providing guidance and recommendations for potential clean energy microproducers.\n\n\u2022 Planning and integrating clean energy generation within new infrastructure \ndevelopment policies to ensure that the orientation and spacing of new \nbuildings allows for solar photovoltaic panels on roofs and walls.\n\n\u2022 Lack of appropriate technologies limiting the \ncapacity to harvest, store and transport clean \nenergy.\n\n\u2022 Investing in grid extension and capacity expansion to harvest and transport \nenergy from remote locations to cities.

The example focuses on decentralised energy production \nfrom clean energy sources to help reduce energy use, reuse \n\navailable waste energy sources and generate clean energy  \nat a small scale to meet remaining local energy demand  \n(Energy Transition Partnership, 2019). Box 3.15 presents a case \nstudy of local clean energy production in Barcelona (Spain).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n80 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 3.14 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: decentralised energy production from clean energy sources\n\nMoving towards a decentralised clean energy system requires establishing coherent overall policy goals, developing \ninstitutional capacity, encouraging stakeholder buy-in and financial support. The economic recession following the \nCOVID-19 pandemic may delay the necessary investment in many European cities. This transition will also require \nlong-term structural changes. The production of clean energy in a city will depend on geography and climate, but it is likely \nto rely on wind power, rooftop solar photovoltaic installations and hydropower (EEA, 2015; World Economic Forum, 2018). \nTo achieve ambitious clean energy targets, cities may need to explore opportunities in surrounding rural areas, which may \nbe more suitable (e.g. because they have more land surface for solar and wind power installations) (IRENA, 2016).\n\nClean energy systems made up of small, localised grids and designed in accordance with circular economy principles can \nhave a range of co-benefits for climate (by lowering carbon emissions), environment (by reducing emissions of harmful \npollutants and waste), urban resilience (by providing a more secure energy supply), economy (by reducing transmission \nlosses) and communities (by creating new jobs). However, this transition will inevitably bring some trade-offs, for example \nbetween the increase in decentralised clean energy systems and the availability of rare materials and land for development \n(EEA, 2017c; Giurco et al., 2019; Seetharaman et al., 2019). Another important trade-off is between clean energy production \nand unemployment in the conventional energy sector (Rivers, 2013). The EU Just Transition mechanism aims to provide \nreskilling opportunities for those workers from carbon-intensive industries and facilitate employment opportunities in new \nsectors and those in transition.\n\nBox 3.15 Example of decentralised clean energy sources: solar hot water ordinance in Barcelona, Spain\n\nSince 2000 (upgraded in 2006), a Solar Thermal Ordinance (STO) has been in place in Barcelona, making it compulsory to use \nsolar energy to supply 60 % of running hot water in all private and public buildings. The Barcelona Energy Agency (BEA) was \nestablished to evaluate the planned installations provided when a building developer seeks approval for both the building design \nand construction permit. Building inspectors are then responsible for ensuring that construction meets the specified criteria.\n\nThe Barcelona STO is an example of the early adoption of such practices and is considered a success because it has \nachieved significant energy savings and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions since it took effect. Stakeholder \nengagement and education on the use and maintenance of solar panels were identified as the main factors contributing to \nthe success of this project. The BEA worked with the neighbourhood association and the body corporates of buildings to \nenable tenants and the public to measure their energy savings and check to ensure that the solar installations are working.\n\nSource: Center for Clean Air Policy (undated). \n\n3.9.3 Lessons for achieving a clean energy transition in \ncities\n\nA number of lessons emerge from the analysis of the clean \nenergy nexus, including:\n\n\u2022 Integrating the nexus policy areas can have a range of \nco-benefits, including climate mitigation (e.g. reduced \ncarbon emissions), environment and health (e.g. reduced \npollution) and social and economic (energy resilience, \nreduction in energy poverty, democratic participation, \nclimate awareness). However, there are also trade-offs, \nfor example between the increase in decentralised clean \nenergy systems and the availability of rare materials and \nland for development.\n\n\u2022 The clean energy transition will require stakeholder \ncooperation across different sectors and governance  \nand spatial scales (EU, interregional, national).  \nSuch integrated decision-making requires a deep  \n\nunderstanding of planning processes across sectors  \n(and governance levels) and may include  \nlocation-specific actions.\n\n\u2022 It is important that energy policy reforms recognise the \ncritical interrelationships between spatial planning, the built \nenvironment and energy sectors, bringing stakeholders \ntogether to explore optimal solutions for clean energy \nproduction.\n\n\u2022 Energy policy reforms need to be adapted to local conditions \nand provide the necessary policy tools (e.g. green building \ncodes, certification programmes, and education campaigns) \nfor their implementation.\n\n\u2022 Cities will need to ensure effective policy and regulatory \nconditions to encourage new clean energy producers \nto enter the market. To further stimulate a clean energy \ntransition, reductions in or the removal of subsidies in the \nconventional energy market is likely to be required.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n81Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n\u2022 A clean energy transition is likely to require support from \ninnovative private-public partnerships and the EU through \nvarious tools, policies and funds (e.g. URBIS (42), European \nFund for Strategic Investments (43), European Regional \nDevelopment Fund and Cohesion Fund).\n\n\u2022 While many policies are still enacted at the national or \nregional level, cities are increasingly taking control of \ntheir own clean energy futures, for example by bringing \nmunicipal energy utilities back into local public and \ncollective ownership (WWI, 2016). This can empower cities \nto unlock the clean energy transition through a range of \nactions, such as target setting, use of local regulations, clean \nenergy consumption in public buildings, street lighting, \nfinancing and advocacy work (IRENA, 2016).\n\nNational governments and multilateral agencies need to \nsupport cities' efforts to achieve the clean energy transition as \npart of their green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic (C40 \nCities, 2020a).\n\n3.10 Sustainable buildings nexus\n\n3.10.1 What are sustainable buildings and why are they \nimportant in an urban context?\n\nSustainable buildings have high levels of energy and resource \nefficiency and reduce environmental impacts across their life \ncycles. Their users enjoy better health and well-being and \nproductivity gains. In turn this translates into cost savings \n(EC,\u00a02016b). The European Commission states that emissions \nin the building sector could be reduced by around 90 % \nby\u00a02050. Recognising this, the Europe 2020 strategy stresses \nthe need to improve resource efficiency in the building sector \n(EC, 2010). This is also reflected in the EU action plan for the \ncircular economy (EC, 2015d). Under the European Green \nDeal, the European Commission has introduced a Renovation \nWave initiative to encourage faster and deeper renovation \n(EC, 2020e). In partnership with industry, the European \nCommission has also developed Level(s) (44), a voluntary \nreporting initiative for environmental performance in the built \nenvironment (EC, 2019e).\n\nThe scale of the challenge, and the potential for energy and \nresource savings through sustainable buildings, including \nretrofitting, is clear. Taking the example of improving energy \nefficiency, it is estimated that approximately 75 % of the existing \nbuilding stock in the EU is energy inefficient (BPIE, 2017).  \nThese buildings would benefit from retrofitting to incorporate \nenergy-efficient technologies and approaches. Such retrofitting \ncould bring co-benefits, such as reducing energy costs and \ncreating healthier buildings for residents. This is also essential \n\n(42) https://eiah.eib.org/about/initiative-urbis.htm\n(43) https://www.eib.org/en/efsi\n(44) Levels \u2014 a voluntary reporting framework that provides a common EU approach to the assessment of environmental performance in the built \n\nenvironment. It provides a set of core indicators for performance assessment. For more information, see: https://ec.europa.eu/environment/\neussd/pdf/Level(s)_factsheet-EN-web.pdf\n\nin the context of the COVID-19 lockdowns, as it has increased \npressure to ensure that building standards provide sufficient \nand suitable living and working space in residential buildings. \n\nSustainable buildings are a key priority, given the need to \nensure not only that buildings use more sustainable heating \nand cooling sources to reduce their associated greenhouse \ngas emissions but also that they are designed to make them \nresilient to future climatic changes and pandemics.\n\nIf more sustainable buildings are present in cities, this would \nsupport progress in other example nexuses, in particular \n'climate resilience', s through using sustainable heating \nand cooling sources; 'closing the loop', through improving \nmanagement of construction waste; and 'environment and \nhealth', through well-insulated housing.\n\nThe sustainable buildings nexus and the COVID-19 \npandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak left office and commercial buildings in \nurban centres dormant for a period of weeks or even months as \nbusinesses closed and/or homeworking became the norm. An \nincrease in homeworking has increased the pressure to ensure \nthat building standards provide sufficient and suitable living \nand working space in residential buildings. Homeworking is also \nincreasing pressure in terms of energy consumption. Housing is \nalso an important social determinant of health, with those living \nin sustainable buildings enjoying better health, well-being and \nproductivity. For those in poor-quality housing, the lockdown \nmeant more time exposed to cold, damp and other hazardous \nconditions, which had consequences for both physical and \nmental health. The COVID-19 pandemic also caused significant \ndisruption to construction supply chains.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant changes \nin future in land use planning and building design and \nconstruction, including designing for energy-efficient and \nhealthy buildings. Such changes could include adopting a \nminimalist design in buildings; flexible entrance areas and \nmore balconies; local landscapes, views from windows and \naccess to sunlight prioritised in planning; and more natural \nventilation (including linear flow extraction, increased humidity \ncontrol, recovery) (Pinheiro and Luis, 2020). As part of their \ngreen recovery plans, city governments could take advantage \nof the next generation EU recovery package to invest in \ntheir ageing housing stock \u2014 to retrofit and renovate public \nbuildings, improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and create green jobs that will kickstart the economy. \nEnergy efficiency retrofits could provide another important \nopportunity for green recovery through job creation, as well as \nreducing energy costs and ensuring healthier buildings through \nimproved housing for residents.\n\nhttps://eiah.eib.org/about/initiative-urbis.htm\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n82 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n3.10.2 Challenges of and actions for achieving \nsustainable buildings\n\nRelevant interlinked policy areas\n\nThis nexus focuses on three interconnected policy areas \nrelevant to achieving sustainable buildings in cities  \n(resource and material use, built environment and urban \ndesign), and on the building blocks relevant to these key  \npolicy areas (see Table 3.1). Many challenges in achieving \nsustainable buildings result from a lack of coordination  \nbetween these three policy areas. For example,  \nsustainability principles need to be integrated into  \nbuilding design while ensuring that these principles  \nare supported by policy related to the use of resources  \nand materials in the city. Integrating these policy areas  \ncould also have co-benefits, such as reducing buildings'  \nlifecycle costs (e.g. energy efficiency or material reuse)  \nand creating healthier buildings.\n\nThe sustainable buildings nexus focuses on the design, construction \nand use phases in the life cycle of residential, public and commercial \n(e.g. retail, office) buildings. Taken together these represent \napproximately 99 % of total building stock in the EU (Ecorys, 2014). \nThe main challenges in achieving sustainable buildings are \nassociated with how, in practice, to reduce resource and energy \nconsumption. Table 3.9 sets out some of the main challenges \ncities may face in achieving sustainable buildings and gives \nexamples of actions that could help to address these challenges.\n\nBox 3.16 presents an example of an interlinked area of \npolicymaking and action relevant to sustainable buildings in \ncities. The example focuses on the use of innovative design,  \nmaterials and systems to help reduce resource consumption  \nin building construction and use. This could reduce the negative \nenvironmental and social impacts, particularly in mining regions \nand on production sites (e.g. cement and steel production).  \nBox 3.17 presents a case study of optimised material use in  \na reconversion project in Loos-en-Gohelle (France).\n\nTable 3.9 Overview of challenges of and actions for achieving sustainable buildings in cities\n\nExample challenges Example actions to address challenges\n\n\u2022 Inefficient resource and energy use \nthroughout the building's life cycle \n(including energy consumption and \nefficiency, water and material use and \nwaste management).\n\n\u2022 Promoting innovative building design to help ensure efficient material use in construction \nand reducing ongoing running and maintenance costs, which enables adaptation and \nreuse of the building over its life cycle (see Box 3.16).\n\n\u2022 Coordinating building design, construction and associated resource management, which \nensures efficient use of resources and energy.

They will often manage a sizeable \n\nBox 3.16 Example of an interlinked policy-action area: reducing resource consumption in building construction \nand use through innovative design, materials and systems\n\nReducing resource consumption focuses on natural resources, building materials and water. Various interventions are aimed at \nreducing resource consumption in building construction and use. Common interventions include innovative design, improved \nmanagement of natural resources and building materials and resource management systems in buildings (e.g. water, waste).\n\nInnovative building design can ensure efficient material use in construction and reduce ongoing running and maintenance \ncosts. This is achieved through resource-efficient features, materials and appliances. Well-designed houses can further \nreduce building material consumption by incorporating approaches that enable adaptation and reuse of the building over \nits life cycle (Mohamed and Alauddin, 2016). Improved management of construction materials can also help to reduce resource  \nuse, for example by identifying and procuring locally sourced and/or recycled materials to minimise the need for imported \nmaterials (Pullen, 2012). Using waste for construction can reduce environmental impacts compared with using virgin materials.\n\nCoordination of these policy areas by using innovative design, materials and systems can also lead to climate, environmental, \nhealth and economic co-benefits from reduced pollution and energy use, improved indoor air quality and increased returns \non investment.\n\nbuilding stock and can also lead by example in developing \nnew public buildings. Green public procurement is one of the \ntools available to city governments. Through public procurement, \nstandards and criteria can be set for suppliers of materials \nand services, including those in the construction sector.\n\n\u2022 City governments are increasingly instigating policies and \nstandards within their geographical limits to encourage \nsustainable buildings (e.g. building and energy codes, fiscal \nor financial incentives that reward private sector uptake of \nmeasures such as retrofitting) (ClimateXChange, 2018).\n\n\u2022 Achieving sustainable buildings will require the fragmented \npolicies and current complexity of relevant legislative frameworks \nto be addressed (Debacker and Manshoven, 2016).\n\n\u2022 By recognising the urgency of improving their building \nstock, city governments could take advantage of the jobs \ncreated by energy efficiency retrofitting to contribute to a \ngreen recovery. In the longer term the pandemic provides \ncities with an opportunity to establish and implement their \nown building stock sustainability standards.\n\nBox 3.17 Example of sustainable use of materials: optimising material use in a reconversion project in  \nLoos-en-Gohelle, France\n\nThe building's owner in partnership with local small to medium-sized enterprises reconverted a historic house  \n(Rehafutur engineer's house) into office facilities.\n\nThe project prioritised the reuse of all types of materials, bearing in mind the building's significant heritage value. For \nexample, marble fireplaces were moved to be reused as ornamental features in public rooms, spruce floorboards were \nre-laid after installing high-performance floor insulation, and rubble was reused to level the parking spaces and access \npaths. A particular focus of the project was the use of building materials from renewable sources (animal and vegetal) and \nfrom recycled material. The project used a range of bio-based and recycled materials to demonstrate the effectiveness of \nrenewable insulation materials. For example, a regional material made out of old clothes (mainly cotton) called M\u00e9tisse was \nused for the insulation.\n\nSource: Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2016).\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n84 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nTable 3.10 Policy agendas for achieving urban environmental sustainability objectives \n\nPolicy agenda Examples of specific actions from the nexuses\n\nImproving urban \nenvironmental quality\n\n\u2022 Policies that reduce car use and motorised traffic (e.g. improved frequency and availability of public \ntransport, reducing speed limits, restricting access and reallocating road space) and reduce air and noise \npollution.\n\n\u2022 Nature-based solutions and/or creating or improving green infrastructure for multiple benefits, including \nreducing air, water and noise pollution.\n\nBuilding adaptive capacity \nand reducing vulnerability \nto climate change\n\n\u2022 Linking adaptation and mitigation policies and investments to maximise synergies.\n\n\u2022 Land use planning policies to create space for water and nature-based solutions.\n\n\u2022 Nature-based solutions to regulate water flows and mitigate flooding.\n\n\u2022 Policies and design standards to create cooling through greening.\n\n\u2022 Preparing comprehensive resilience strategies.\n\nImproving the quality \nof and access to public \nopen space, and creating \nor improving green \ninfrastructure and urban \necology\n\n\u2022 Using standards such as the Green Space Factor to determine green infrastructure requirements for new \ndevelopments.\n\n\u2022 Designing green spaces and green infrastructure for multiple uses and benefits, including active transport, \nenvironmental quality, social meeting points, biodiversity conservation and enhanced quality of life.\n\n\u2022 Urban containment boundary policies to create 'hard' edges between cities and the countryside.\n\nSupporting urban \nagriculture and food \nsystems\n\n\u2022 Initiatives to promote urban agriculture through small-scale innovation projects.\n\n\u2022 Providing incentives and building capacity among start-ups and community\u2013based  \nfood-related innovation projects. \n\nIncreasing the production \nof renewable energy, \nreducing energy \nconsumption/demand \nand improving energy \nefficiency\n\n\u2022 Integrating spatial planning and built environment policies to ensure that the orientation and spacing of \nnew buildings allows for solar photovoltaic panels on roofs and walls.\n\n\u2022 Planning and integrating clean energy generation within new infrastructure development.\n\n\u2022 Local building codes and sustainable design standards that promote reduced energy consumption and \nimproved energy efficiency in buildings and reduce running costs.\n\n\u2022 Information and services to encourage behaviour change (e.g. public awareness campaigns) to reduce \nenergy demand, and measures to make the energy transition affordable.\n\n3.11 Policy and governance implications\n\n3.11.1 Policy action to achieve urban environmental \nsustainability objectives\n\nThe eight priority nexuses presented above illustrate the \nrange of potential actions needed to transition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability.

These policy agendas relate to the  \nbuilding blocks for urban sustainability, and each agenda  \nis relevant to at least two nexuses, and generally three  \nor more. This shows that, although cities are complex  \nsystems in which there are myriad interactions between \ninterventions and sectors, in practice a relatively small  \nnumber of policy agendas can be identified through  \nwhich urban environmental sustainability can  \nbe achieved.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n85Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nPolicy agenda Examples of specific actions from the nexuses\n\nReducing material use \nand waste and improving \nresource efficiency\n\n\u2022 Organisational restructuring, policies, investment and training of workforces to reduce material \nconsumption, encourage material repair and reuse and find uses and value for waste as a resource.\n\n\u2022 Local building codes and sustainable design and retrofitting standards that promote resource efficiency and \nreduced material use and waste in building construction and use, including reduced maintenance costs.\n\n\u2022 Setting up consumer repair and reuse hubs by working with communities, civil society and the private \nsector.\n\n\u2022 Investing in the waste management infrastructure to minimise waste and maximise reuse and repair.\n\n\u2022 Systems to support urban agriculture as part of a wider circular economy and resilience effort.\n\nUsing digital technology \u2022 Initiatives to use developments in telecommunications and e-commerce to reduce need for conventional \ntransport.\n\n\u2022 Using technology that provides real-time information about available food (e.g. food donation-matching \nsoftware).\n\nImproving urban \nconnectivity and \nsustainable mobility\n\n\u2022 Economic incentives (e.g. road pricing, congestion charging) or regulations (e.g. parking restrictions, speed \nlimits) to encourage a shift to active transport modes.\n\n\u2022 Information and services to encourage behaviour change (e.g. public awareness campaigns) to shift away \nfrom cars towards walking, cycling and public transport.\n\n\u2022 Policies to cluster new developments around existing transport nodes and routes to promote transitoriented development.\n\n\u2022 Policies to promote car-free cities.\n\nStrengthening transitions \nto a green economy\n\n\u2022 Awareness-raising campaigns, networks and capacity building among citizens and businesses on the \neconomic opportunities of the circular economy (e.g. new jobs, reduced costs, supply security).\n\nEnhancing built \nenvironment and physical \ninfrastructure\n\n\u2022 Policies and initiatives to promote regeneration through pedestrianisation schemes and greening 'grey' \nareas or brownfield sites.\n\n\u2022 Integrating clean energy generation within new infrastructure developments. \n\nImproving the quality of \nhousing stock\n\n\u2022 Retrofitting buildings to improve environmental performance (e.g. energy efficiency) and to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u2022 Setting targets and providing tools to encourage sustainable building design and construction.\n\nPromoting integrated, \nlong-term spatial planning \nand policymaking\n\n\u2022 Land use planning policies to develop and protect green infrastructure for flood management.\n\n\u2022 Bringing municipalities together to coordinate transport across a wider metropolitan area.\n\n\u2022 Developing circular city strategies, policies and/or roadmaps.\n\nEnhancing social and \nenvironmental justice\n\n\u2022 Profiting from investments in greening existing urban spaces to ensure that they benefit low-income \nresidents and avoid 'green' gentrification.\n\n\u2022 Designing climate adaptation and mitigation interventions to address the needs of the most vulnerable \ngroups.\n\nPromoting participation \nand empowerment of \nstakeholders and citizens\n\n\u2022 Using land use planning to empower stakeholders to contribute to both food security and community \ncohesion.\n\n\u2022 Involving citizens, businesses and other stakeholders in the development and design of strategies or plans \n(e.g. adaptation and mitigation, circularity).\n\nEncouraging partnerships \nand community-led initiatives \nand facilitating social \ninnovation\n\n\u2022 Facilitating community-civil society-private sector partnerships to set up consumer repair and reuse hubs \n(e.g. urban resource centres).\n\n\u2022 Removing legal barriers to facilitate community and/or private investment in decentralised clean energy \nsystems.\n\nTable 3.10 Policy agendas for achieving urban environmental sustainability objectives (cont.)\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n86 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n3.11.2 Improved urban policy integration \u2014 co-benefits \nand trade-offs\n\nThe nexus approach can be useful for decision-makers, as it \nencourages communication and coordination.

Focused assessment \nand improved coordination can help realise co-benefits from \npolicies and action across policy areas. It can also uncover \npotential blind spots in decision-making processes that lead to \nunintended consequences and undermine progress in other \npolicy areas. This is achieved by highlighting potential trade-offs.\n\nBox 3.18 provides some examples of co-benefits. There are also \ntrade-offs, for example 'urban accessibility' can be achieved \nthrough increasing urban densities. However, focusing on \ndensity without considering wider mobility and connectivity \ncould lead to trade-offs such as increased traffic congestion \nand associated air pollution and noise; pressure on green \nspaces; and social impacts due to gentrification and high \nhousing costs. Such outcomes could conflict with the 'quality \nof life', 'environment and health' and 'climate resilience' nexus \nobjectives. Table 3.10 also illustrates how policymaking and \naction intended to help achieve one nexus objective can lead \ndirectly to and/or have co-benefits and trade-offs in achieving \nother nexus objectives.\n\n3.11.3 Identifying cost-effective policy and interventions\n\nThe example nexus assessments show that some actions \ncan deliver multiple benefits simultaneously across urban \nsustainability objectives. Maximising the (co-)benefits of \ncoordinated and integrated policymaking and action has  \nthe potential to achieve urban sustainability objectives in a  \ncost-effective way. Clearly, generating multiple benefits does \nnot necessarily mean that the action has achieved those \nbenefits in a cost-effective way. Such an assumption needs \nto be compared with achieving the same benefits in an \nunconnected way. However, it is likely that this approach  \nwill deliver cost-effectiveness.\n\n3.11.4 The role of cities in delivering urban \nenvironmental sustainability \u2014 top-down \nand\u00a0bottom-up\n\nThe nexus analysis confirms that cities are well placed to  \nbe leaders in delivering the transition to a low-carbon \nsustainable economy, through their ability to address many  \nof the systemic challenges that Europe faces. It should be  \nnoted that this is partially a result of the nexuses being \nselected based on their relevance to cities and city governance. \nNonetheless, for most of the nexus policy areas the role of  \ncities is well defined (e.g. transport, housing, spatial planning).  \n\nBox 3.18 Examples of co-benefits of measures to achieve urban environmental sustainability\n\nDeveloping and improving green infrastructure in cities can help to deliver multiple objectives including:\n\n\u2022 Climate resilience \u2014 reducing flood risk and urban overheating.\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 reducing air and noise pollution and encouraging active travel.\n\n\u2022 Quality of life \u2014 improving people's satisfaction with where they live.\n\nThe 'urban accessibility' nexus highlights that transit-oriented development and the promotion of active transport modes \ncan help achieve:\n\n\u2022 'environment and health', 'quality of life' and 'climate resilience' objectives by, for example, improving air quality, \nincreasing physical activity levels, improving the quality of places and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAction for 'sustainable buildings' can also support:\n\n\u2022 Closing the loop \u2014 improving the management of construction waste and material use.\n\n\u2022 Clean energy \u2014 using rooftops and walls for clean energy production.\n\n\u2022 Climate resilience \u2014 using sustainable heating and cooling sources to help buildings adapt.\n\n\u2022 Environment and health \u2014 through well-insulated housing achieving better indoor air quality and reduced exposure \nto outdoor noise.\n\n\u2022 Quality of life \u2014 designing housing in which residents feel comfortable and safe.\n\f\nThe urban nexus approach: towards integrated, cost-effective actions\n\n87Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nThis enables cities to design, resource (although financial \nautonomy varies between cities) and implement sector-specific \npolicymaking and actions without necessarily requiring reforms to \nthe policymaking process at national and/or EU level. For example, \ncities are key actors in setting out and implementing land use and \nspatial planning policies and standards within their geographical \nlimits, and the solutions required are often location specific.\n\nHowever, EU and national governments also have an important \nrole in setting coherent policy at different scales and helping \ncities overcome challenges to achieving the nexus objectives \nthrough, for example, setting high-level strategic targets and \ngoals (e.g. related to greenhouse gas reductions), developing \nclear standards and guidelines, providing financial support  \n(e.g. Urbact III (2014-2020), LIFE, European Regional Development \nFund), and promoting knowledge sharing (e.g. Urbact good \npractices database, Climate-ADAPT) and peer-to-peer exchange.\n\n3.11.5 New governance approaches for urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nAddressing the challenges to achieving urban sustainability \nrequires governance approaches that are able to combine \nshort- and long-term goals and work across sectors and silos. \nThe nexus assessment highlights the importance of systematic \nidentification of conflicts and barriers across policy sectors \nand the need for horizontal and vertical integration and \ncoordination of measures.\n\nHorizontal integration of measures will require an understanding \nof processes and objectives across sectors that might be resource \nintensive. For vertical integration of measures, the importance of \nmultilevel governance is evident in several nexuses. For example, \nsome policy areas (e.g. transport, built environment) relevant \nto achieving 'urban accessibility' and 'climate resilience' are \npotentially managed by different stakeholders at different spatial \nlevels. Improved communication and coordination between \nthe actors from the private and public sectors and at different \ngovernance levels (e.g. EU, national, city) will help move cities \ntowards reaching their urban sustainability objectives.\n\n3.11.6 Citizens and communities are at the heart of the \ntransition\n\nMoving towards greater urban environmental sustainability \nrequires an acknowledgement that people are a fundamental \npart of the various systems (food, energy, transport, etc.). To \nchange such systems means engaging with citizens in designing \nand implementing solutions and encouraging sustainable \nbehaviours. For example, the 'closing the loop' nexus highlights \nthe value of community-led initiatives such as repair cafes, \nwhich are enabling citizens to drive sustainable change in their \ncommunities.\n\nAcross all nexuses, in order to be truly effective, equitable action \nand collaboration must be central to any policy responses. \nVulnerable groups are often most affected by poor urban \nconditions (e.g. air pollution, noise pollution, access to green \nspace) but also the least able to benefit from improvements, \nas they are often not part of the decision-making process. \nDecision-makers in cities need to ensure that achieving urban \nsustainability objectives does not come at the expense of the \nmost vulnerable urban residents.\n\n3.11.7 Indicators and data measuring progress towards \nachieving urban sustainability\n\nEach of the priority nexuses is framed around a nexus objective \n(e.g. clean energy, accessibility) and selected interacting policy \nareas. Measuring progress towards nexus objectives could be \nachieved by either using existing indicators or creating new \noverarching indicators or indices, for example an overall index \nof urban climate resilience, or through monitoring a range of \noutcomes associated with achieving the nexus objective, for \nexample, in the case of climate resilience, measuring change in \nflood risk to urban communities. The nexus analyses presented \nin this report are intended to be illustrative and explore selected \nexamples of interacting areas of policy and action. However, a \ncomprehensive compilation of potential nexus indicators has \nnot been completed, and this is something for further research \n(see Section 5.4.4). \n\f\n\u00a9 Enik\u0151 Benedek, My City/EEA\n\f\n89Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n4\nPioneering cities: learning \n\nfrom their experience\n\nKey Messages\n\n\u2022 Scope of the research \u2014 all of the cities that participated in this research were either winners or finalists of two \nprestigious awards \u2014 the European Green Capital Awards or the European Green Leaf Awards \u2014 and can therefore be \nseen in many ways as leaders when it comes to urban sustainability. An obvious potential expansion of the research \nin future would be to obtain a more nuanced perspective of the experiences of cities at different stages of their \nsustainability journeys.\n\n\u2022 Methodological approach to the meta-analysis \u2014 the analysis was based on a mixed methods approach and was \nstructured around a series of potential drivers and barriers \u2014 actions that are 'supporting or inhibiting' transitions to \nurban environmental sustainability. These were in turn grouped under 'context' and the set of six enabling factors, \nnamely governance, culture, finance, knowledge, data and information, and technology, as defined within the urban \nenvironmental sustainability conceptual framework.\n\n\u2022 Drivers of and barriers to urban environmental sustainability transitions \u2014 key drivers and barriers emerged \nfrom this research; however, there was also a divergence between cities in terms of the importance of the different \nfactors. This indicates that what drives sustainability transitions, at least to some extent, varies between cities and \nthere is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to achieving sustainability transitions.\n\n\u2022 Lessons from the analysis of drivers and barriers of sustainability transitions \u2014 a number of early lessons related \nto drivers of and barriers to sustainability transitions in European cities emerged from the research, and these may be \nhelpful to policymakers and other urban stakeholders.\n\n4.1 Background to understanding the drivers \nof and barriers to urban environmental \nsustainability transitions\n\nThe European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 report \n(SOER 2020) (EEA, 2019a) emphasises that cities are key \ndrivers of change when it comes to the wider sustainability \ntransitions across Europe. Cities are hubs of creativity, \nlearning and innovation and have the capacity to effect \nsystemic changes across a range of critical environmental \nissues (EEA,\u00a02019a,\u00a02020b). Cities concentrate people, \njobs and economic activity but this also means that they \nare disproportionately affected by systemic social and \nenvironmental challenges such as segregation, poverty, \ninequality, vulnerability to climate change and other \nenvironmental stresses (EEA,\u00a02019a). Environmental challenges \nare often most acutely felt in urban areas because of the higher \ndensities of people and infrastructure, their dependence on \n\ntheir hinterlands for food, water, energy and other resources, \nand negative economic impacts caused by climate change \n(EEA,\u00a02019a, 2020b).\n\nCities are therefore both places where these systemic challenges \n(e.g. inequality, climate change, environmental stress, resources \nsecurity) originate and are most acutely felt and places offering \nopportunities to address them. Their potential as places for \nexperimentation and technological and social innovations \nemerges, because the systemic challenges and opportunities to \naddress them are fundamentally embedded in the day-to-day \ndynamics and experiences of urban life, which puts cities at the \nforefront of tackling sustainability issues.\n\nMany of the most important innovations to counteract \nunsustainable behaviours and practices originate in cities \n(GCEC, 2014). These include emerging social innovations \nsuch as sharing and the circular economy, shifts towards \n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n90 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nsustainable mobility, 'prosumerism', slow food movements \nand community-oriented forms of living (EEA, 2020a) but also \nenergy-efficient housing, urban farming and decentralised \nrenewable energy systems (Frantzeskaki et al., 2017).\n\nUrban authorities are often the level of government closest to \ncitizens and are therefore at the frontline of determining the \noverall success of European sustainable urban development \n(EC, 2016a). Since the signing of the 2016 Pact of Amsterdam \nand the urban agenda for the EU that emerged from it, this \nimportant role has been recognised and, as a result, cities have \nbegun to have a much more substantive 'seat at the table' of \nEU governance (Potjer and Hajer, 2017). Globally, the role of \ncities as key governance actors in the transition towards more \nsustainable systems is being recognised, with city networks \nand associations taking on a much more central role in shaping \nglobal climate and sustainability agreements (EEA, 2020a, 2020b).\n\nIt is increasingly recognised that the complex and interrelated \nchallenges of climate change, environmental degradation \nand rising inequality will not be solved without a fundamental \ntransformation of our societies. Far-reaching changes \nare needed in our production and consumption systems, \ntechnologies, infrastructures, cultures and lifestyles, as well as \nin the corresponding governance and institutional frameworks. \nSystemic realignments, such as sharing and the circular \neconomy, shifts towards sustainable mobility, urban farming and \ndecentralised renewable energy systems, can be referred to as \nurban environmental sustainability transitions: fundamental and \nstructural changes in urban systems through which persistent \nenvironmental and societal challenges are addressed.\n\nSOER 2020 shows that there is a rapidly closing window of \nopportunity for such transformational change to take place,  \nand cities are a vital source in this context (EEA, 2019a). The \ngood news is that we already have much of the knowledge, \ntechnologies and tools we need for sustainability transitions to \ntake place \u2014 the question now is how to accelerate and scale this \nprocess (EEA, 2019f). Understanding the enabling conditions \nand drivers of change needed to achieve sustainability transitions \nis important. So too is a clearer sense of the barriers that may be \npreventing some cities from reaching their sustainability potential \nor overcoming long-standing economic, institutional and cultural \nchallenges leading to sub-optimal environmental outcomes  \nand preventing more radical change from taking place.\n\nLocal governments across Europe are rising to this challenge \nand proactively leading the way towards a more sustainable, \nresilient and just urban future. Of course, cities differ \nenormously in the challenges they face and the tools they have \navailable to address them. Sharing practical examples of the \nmany different expressions of urban sustainability can help  \nto inspire cities irrespective of their context to recognise that  \nthere is a transition pathway that is right for them.\n\nThis chapter presents the results of a meta-analysis as \npresented in the EEA report nr 16/2020 (EEA, 2020f) aiming to \nimprove the understanding of the drivers of change that can \neither enable or hinder urban environmental sustainability \ntransitions in European cities. Given the EEA's remit and \ninterests, the focus of this research is on urban environmental \nsustainability transitions \u2014 note that throughout this chapter \nwhere the term 'sustainability transitions' is used the principal \nfocus is on the environmental dimension of sustainability \ntransitions within an urban context.\n\nIt should be noted that all cities that participated in this \nresearch were either winners of or finalists in two prestigious \nawards and can therefore be seen in many ways as leaders \nwhen it comes to urban sustainability. This may contribute \nto an overall positive view of the factors influencing urban \nenvironmental transitions. If cities that have to date been less \nsuccessful in advancing the sustainability agenda had been \nincluded in this research, it is likely that the assessment of \ndrivers and barriers would have been different. However, this \ndoes not make the research approach less applicable to any \ngiven city, it merely highlights that this study may need to be \nexpanded in future to obtain a more nuanced perspective \nof the experiences of cities at different stages of their \nsustainability journeys.\n\n4.2 Methodological approach to the  \nmeta-analysis\n\nThe analysis was based on a mixed methods approach \ncombining literature review, a survey (EEA survey on  \nurban transitions towards environmental sustainability) \nand semi-structured interviews with representatives of  \nseven case study cities that help to deepen and contextualise \nthe survey results. The survey was conducted with a selection  \nof 'frontrunner' cities that have either won or been selected  \nas finalists in the European Green Capital Awards (EGCA) or  \nthe European Green Leaf Awards (EGLA). It was structured \naround a series of potential drivers and barriers \u2014 actions  \nthat are 'supporting or inhibiting' transitions to urban \nenvironmental sustainability. These were in turn grouped  \nunder 'context' (i.e. distinct context of every city) and the  \nset of six enabling factors, namely governance, culture,  \nfinance, knowledge, data and information, and technology, \nas defined within the urban environmental sustainability \nconceptual framework (see Chapter 2).\n\nThe geographical spread of the 26 cities that responded to  \nthe survey broadly reflects the distribution of all 40 winners  \nand finalists of the EGCA and EGLA. Cities in eastern Europe \nwere the least represented, followed by cities in southern, \nnorthern and western Europe. Most of the city representatives \nwho completed the survey work in environment and climate  \nchange departments.\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n91Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nAfter completing the survey, representatives of seven of  \nthese cities (Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Gabrovo, Leuven, Lisbon, \nMikkeli, Stockholm and Tallinn) were interviewed to achieve \na more nuanced understanding of what drives urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions in some European \ncities. Map 4.1 shows all participating cities, including those  \nthat responded to the survey and those for which an  \ninterview was carried out.\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\n\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n\nBarcelona\n\nMollet del Vall\u00e8s\n\nCornell\u00e0 de LlobregatLisbon\n\nTorres Vedras\n\nGalway\n\nLimerick\n\nBristol\n\nNantes\n\nGlasgow\n\nJoensuu\n\nMikkeli\n\nLappeenrantaLahti\n\nUme\u00e5\n\nMalm\u00f6\n\nV\u00e4xj\u00f6\n\nCopenhagen\n\nFrankfurt\n\nLudwigsburg\n\nNuremberg\n\nFreiburg\n\nHamburg\n\nBrussels\nGhent\n\nMechelen\nLeuven\n\nM\u00fcnster\n\nEssen\n\nNijmegen\nAmsterdam\n\nHorst aan de Maas\ns\u2019-Hertogenbosch\n\nOslo\n\nGabrovo\n\nTallinn\nStockholm\n\nReykjavik\n\nLjubljana\n\nEuropean Green Capital and \nEuropean Green Leaf Award \nwinners and finalists and \nsurvey respondents\n\nEuropean Green Capital Award \n\nResponded to survey\n\nNo response to survey\n\nInterviewed\n\nEuropean Green Leaf Award \n\nResponded to survey\n\nNo response to survey\n\nInterviewed\n\nAzores Is.\n\nMadeira Is.\n\nCanary Is.\n\nGiven the relatively limited scope of this study, these findings \nshould be seen as a starting point for a wider conversation \nabout the drivers of urban sustainability transitions rather \nthan a definitive overview of the multitude of complex and \ninterrelated factors that shape sustainability outcomes in \nEuropean cities. Detailed information on the methodological \napproach adopted in this research, and its limitations, is \navailable in the stand-alone SEC report.\n\nMap 4.1 European Green Capital and European Green Leaf Award winners and finalists and survey respondents\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n92 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n4.2.1 About the cities that participated in the research\n\nThe cities that were analysed for this research face a wide range  \nof environmental challenges, with the most commonly identified \nchallenges including severe storms and flooding, air pollution, \nstormwater management, decline of native species and natural \nhabitats and heat waves. This was confirmed by the interviews, \nin which storms, flooding, air pollution, water scarcity, heat \nwaves and lack of green space were identified as major \nchallenges by the representatives of the seven case study cities.\n\nMost cities in the survey have been considering environmental \nsustainability objectives as an important part of their political \nagendas since the period between 1992 (the Rio Conference) \nand 2000. This means that they have had several decades to \nmainstream these considerations into their wider policymaking \nprocesses and can be considered to have a fairly well-established \ntrack record in this area. In the interviews, several city \nrepresentatives felt that sustainability only really emerged as  \na core aspect of their political agenda in the past 10 years or  \nso (e.g. Tallinn), while others felt that sustainability had been  \nan important priority for several decades (e.g. Stockholm).\n\nAccording to the survey findings, public opinion and awareness \nof sustainability issues was seen as the most significant trigger \ndriving greater action around environmental sustainability in \ncities. This was followed by changes in political leadership, a \nspecific environmental crisis and pressure from stakeholders. \nThese findings were confirmed by the interviews, in which \ngrowing public awareness of environmental issues and the \npolitical vision of individual leaders was repeatedly highlighted \nas important triggers.\n\n4.3 Key drivers and barriers of urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions\n\nThis section summarises the key drivers of and key barriers \nto urban environmental sustainability transitions identified \nthrough this research. Looking across all of the enabling factors, \nit highlights particular factors that stood out from the survey \nresults and subsequent interviews. While there was certainly \na consensus among the participating city representatives \nregarding the importance of some factors, this did not apply \nuniversally. Factors that were identified as extremely important \nto the sustainability transition by some city representatives \nwere highlighted as a barrier or considered less relevant by \nothers. Despite this heterogeneity of opinions, some important \nfindings in relation to the key drivers of and barriers to urban \nenvironmental transitions emerge from this work. In future \n\nresearch, these should be tested further to confirm their \nrobustness in different urban contexts.\n\n4.3.1 Key drivers supporting urban environmental \nsustainability transitions\n\nContextual drivers\n\n\u2022 The most significant contextual factors identified in the \nsurvey as supporting the sustainability transitions in cities \nare existing infrastructure, air/water/soil quality, city size, \nclimatic conditions and gross domestic product (GDP)  \nper capita.\n\n\u2022 Although the survey identified existing infrastructure \nas the most important supporting factor, the interviews \nhighlighted that it can also be a barrier (e.g. car-centric \nroad use, urban sprawl, outdated/energy inefficient \ninfrastructure). As this is one of the more dynamic \ncontextual factors, it can be adapted to align it with new \nsustainability objectives (e.g. removing parking to make \nspace for cycle lanes, retrofitting buildings).\n\n\u2022 Close proximity to natural assets and exposure to green \nspaces and natural areas was seen in the interviews as an \nimportant contextual factor that can encourage people \nto care about environmental sustainability, which then \nbecomes an important driver for more action.\n\nGovernance drivers\n\n\u2022 Among the factors related to national and  \nsupranational governance, international treaties and  \nEU laws, standards and regulations stand out as the  \nmost strongly supporting factors. These are followed  \nby national laws, standards and regulations and then  \nby distribution of state powers and the level of  \npolitical decentralisation.\n\n\u2022 While all the factors related to local governance are \nconsidered as mostly supporting, local government's overall \nvision and plans were seen as the most important local \ngovernance factor (see Figure 4.1).\n\n\u2022 Effective multi-level governance across sectors and \ngovernance scales (see Box 4.1), as well as better \ncollaboration with non-governmental stakeholders such  \nas civil society, the private sector and academia, were  \nalso highlighted as important drivers in the interviews.\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n93Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 4.1 Metropolitan governance supports sustainability transition in Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat\n\nSpain has a decentralised system of governance, with 17 autonomous regions that have the ability to create laws and \nmanage their own budgets, regional parliaments and even more decentralised levels of government in the form of \nprovinces and local authorities (Fernandez, 2018). As a result of this multi-level governance system, Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat's \nenvironmental and urban policies are mostly coordinated with the autonomous region of Catalonia, the province of \nBarcelona and, most importantly, the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (AMB). The last is a public authority that consists of the \ncity of Barcelona as well as 36 other municipalities. The AMB is responsible for managing territorial and urban planning, \nmobility, housing, environment, economic development and social cohesion (AMB, 2020).\n\nEfforts by the AMB to tackle the metropolitan areas' environmental challenges comprehensively have been one of the \nmain drivers of sustainability transitions in Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat. The municipality is part of the continuous urban area \nof Barcelona, meaning that it makes sense for strategic areas such as transport to be planned in an integrated way. For a \nsmall municipality of less than 100 000 inhabitants, there are also important benefits in being part of a wider governance \nsystem that can provide support across a range of different policy sectors. For example, to alleviate the crisis arising \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic the AMB has added a new investment programme for municipalities \u2014 the environmental \nsustainability plan. The AMB will allocate EUR 110 million for the next three years, of which Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat will \nreceive approximately EUR 5 million. These investments will be used to achieve a more accessible mobility system and to \nadapt it to the needs of the current and future pandemics. These resources will also be used to promote the ecological and \nenergy transition through investments in resource management (energy and water) and municipal waste.\n\nAlthough political parties may not be aligned across the municipal, metropolitan, provincial and regional level, there is \nbroad cross-party agreement over the importance of acting on climate change and other shared environmental priorities. \nThis has helped to depoliticise the topic of sustainability and to ensure that there is continuity in the strategic vision for all \nmunicipalities in the wider metropolitan area.\n\nFigure 4.1 Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to local governance supported or \ninhibited the environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n3\n\n5\n\n5\n\n7\n\n11\n\n7\n\n10\n\n18\n\n14\n\n22\n\n8\n\n9\n\n12\n\n11\n\n11\n\n16\n\n14\n\n6\n\n11\n\n3\n\n9\n\n6\n\n7\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n3\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nElection cycles/term times\n\nTrade-offs of environmental sustainability with\n other objectives\n\nModels of public services delivery (public, private,\n public-private partnership)\n\nPlanning culture and practices\n\nLevel of coordination and integration of\n environmental sustainability\n\nImplementation of local governance innovations\n\nMeasurable targets and monitoring of policy\n objectives\n\nIndividual political leadership\n\nLevel of civic engagement and public participation\n\nLocal government overall vision and strategic plans\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited \n\nSlightly inhibited Strongly inhibited I don\u2019t know\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n94 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nKnowledge drivers\n\n\u2022 All factors related to knowledge were mostly seen as \nsupporting the sustainability transition. The top factors \nidentified through the survey include networks of cities \nand peer-to-peer learning (selected as supporting by every \ncity in the survey); research and innovation; and level of \nawareness of environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 These findings were confirmed in interviews in which \nthe role of city networks and the learning and innovation \nthey enable were emphasised as an important positive \ndriver in all cities, with the EGCA and EGLA standing out as \nparticularly important drivers (see Box 4.2).\n\n\u2022 Research and innovation, particularly if done in a \ncollaborative and inclusive way across public, private and \nthird sectors, and raising awareness of environmental \nsustainability were also highlighted repeatedly. \n\nCultural drivers\n\n\u2022 The cultural factors that were seen as most important \nin supporting the sustainability transition include the \ngeneral public's values and attitudes to environmental \nsustainability; local government's willingness to adopt new \nbehaviours and practices; the level of public engagement; \nand values and attitudes to environmental sustainability \nwithin local government.\n\n\u2022 The importance of engaging local citizens early and \nconsistently in the sustainability transition was highlighted \n\nBox 4.2 The European Green Capital and Green Leaf Awards: powerful drivers of change\n\nThe European Green Capital and European Green Leaf Awards emerge as an important driver of environmental \nsustainability for the winners and finalists of the awards. All of the city representatives interviewed emphasised the central \nrole that these awards had played in accelerating their sustainability journey.\n\nThe benefits identified by cities can be grouped into three main categories of drivers:\n\n1. Benchmarking \u2014 the stringent requirements set out in the application for the awards push cities to take stock of \ntheir current environmental performance and identify gaps in their knowledge. Cities are encouraged to systematically \nassess what they are doing and how they could improve: many cities reported that this was an important driver for \ntackling the environmental challenges that they were struggling with most.\n\n2. Strategic thinking \u2014 the application for the awards promotes more strategic thinking around environmental \nsustainability and how it is integrated into wider city visions, as well as how it links to other urban development \nchallenges.\n\n3. Legitimacy and leadership \u2014 winning the awards has major reputational benefits and is seen as providing greater \nlegitimacy, enabling cities to demonstrate to political leaders and the public that their environmental efforts are paying \noff. It also allows cities to take on greater leadership in different areas of environmental sustainability.\n\nin the interviews as the best way to change values  \nand attitudes to environmental sustainability and ensure \nthat people feel included in the transition process.\n\nTechnological drivers\n\n\u2022 As indicated by the survey and interviews, technological \ndevelopment is generally seen as an important enabler \nof environmental sustainability transitions in cities. \nNevertheless, the increasing digitalisation of economies  \nand societies raises concerns over social inclusion and \nequity, as some social groups with poor computer literacy \nor limited access to information and communications \ntechnology (ICT) devices (e.g. elderly people, low-income \nfamilies) are at risk of not only being excluded from  \nspheres of community participation and involvement  \nbut also of having reduced access to vital public services.\n\n\u2022 While all the factors related to technology were seen \nas largely supporting the environmental sustainability \ntransition, technologies for environmental monitoring  \n(e.g. air quality monitors) and low-carbon technologies  \n(e.g. electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic power) stand  \nout as being the most supportive.\n\n\u2022 The interviews further confirmed that cities are \nimplementing and relying on ICT and big data analytics,  \nas well as developments in low-carbon technologies  \nand environmental monitoring technologies, to further  \ntheir green efforts in various sectors including housing, \ntransport, energy, governance, water and waste \nmanagement.\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n95Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nData and information drivers\n\n\u2022 The survey highlighted that most factors related to \ndata and information are recognised as supporting the \nenvironmental sustainability transition (see Figure 4.2). \nFactors that stand out in the survey and that were also \nmentioned frequently by interviewees are data and \ninformation collection practices and presentation and \ncommunication of data and information (both considered \nas supporting factors by more than two thirds of respondents).\n\n\u2022 Most interviewees mentioned the significance of data and \ninformation for monitoring and presenting a city's progress, \nsetting relevant objectives and prioritising policies and \nactions needed to achieve sustainability targets.\n\n\u2022 Several cities highlighted that they are working on \nenhancing their information collection and communication \npractices and that there is a growing recognition of the \nimportant role these factors play in successful sustainability \ntransitions, helping cities with evidence-based decision-making \nand ex post analysis of specific interventions including policies.\n\nFigure 4.2 Responses to survey question 'Have the following factors related to data and information \nsupported or inhibited the urban environmental sustainability transition in your city?'\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n5\n\n8\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n9\n\n14\n\n12\n\n12\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nData and information sharing practices (e.g. open data)\n\nScale of available data (e.g. national, regional, local)\n\nQuality (e.g. robustness, reliability, relevance,\n comparability, compatibility) of data and information\n\nAccessibility of data and information (e.g. formats and\n ease of accessing)\n\nPresentation and communication of data and information\n(e.g. analysis and linking data to policy outcomes)\n\nData and information collection practices (e.g. statistical\n services, qualitative and quantitative data collection)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nNumber of respondents\n\nStrongly supported Slightly supported Neither supported nor inhibited Slightly inhibited\n\nStrongly inhibited I don\u2018t know No answer\n\nSource: Authors' compilation.\n\nFinancial drivers\n\n\u2022 The main financial factors identified in the survey as \nsupporting the sustainability transition are own-source \nrevenues (e.g. local taxes, fees); level of national/state \nfunding for environmental sustainability; and access  \nto multilateral funds (e.g. European Regional  \nDevelopment Fund).\n\n\u2022 The importance of multilateral funding, and in particular \nEU funding, was seen as absolutely essential by all \ninterviewees, providing support for sustainability \ninvestments ranging from energy efficiency through \ntransport improvements and upgrades to improving water \nand sanitation infrastructures.\n\n\u2022 Green public procurement was also seen as an  \nimportant driver, and the role of EU procurement policies \nwas highlighted as particularly valuable in supporting  \ncities to improve their procurement processes and \nembracing green procurement as a vital part of their \nsustainability transitions.\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n96 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n4.3.2 Key barriers to urban environmental \nsustainability transitions\n\nContextual barriers\n\n\u2022 Key barriers identified in the survey as hindering the \ntransition are gentrification demographics, existing urban \nform and the structure of the economy.\n\n\u2022 The interviews highlighted that urbanisation and population \npressures (e.g. population growth, urban sprawl, gentrification), \nespecially in the context of the climate crisis, intensify \nexisting environmental challenges and can make it harder \nto advance towards greater environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Demographics can present a barrier in different ways: \ngrowing populations put more pressure on existing services, \nwhile sparse populations make delivering certain services \nsuch as public transport more challenging. An ageing \npopulation and the 'brain drain' caused by the migration of \nyoung people was also seen as a major challenge.\n\nGovernance barriers\n\n\u2022 Barriers were identified in relation to sub-national laws, \nstandards and regulations and importantly sub-national \ntaxes, subsidies or other economic instruments. Some \ncities have less legislative and fiscal autonomy, which might \nhinder their ability to pursue environmental ambitions.  \nFor example, they might be unable to collect emissions tax, \nwhich might adversely affect efforts to decarbonise urban \neconomies and encourage more sustainable travel patterns.\n\n\u2022 Factors related to local governance that significantly  \nhinder transitions in a small selection of cities include \nelection cycle/term times and related continuity of \nlocal government and administration; planning culture \nand practices; and trade-offs between environmental \nsustainability and other objectives.\n\nKnowledge barriers\n\n\u2022 The following factors were identified as barriers by a small \nselection of cities (suggesting that all of these factors \nwere not sufficiently well developed or lacking in the city): \nlevel of awareness of environmental sustainability; level \nof shared understanding of sustainability issues in local \ngovernment; communication within local government and \nbetween different levels of government; and knowledge \nmanagement and dissemination.\n\n\u2022 The interviews further highlighted that a lack of shared \nunderstanding of sustainability priorities and insufficient \ncommunication across government departments can at \ntimes be an important barrier when it comes to knowledge \ncreation and dissemination.\n\nCultural barriers\n\n\u2022 Although this was also one of the main supporting \nfactors, the willingness of the general public to adopt new \nbehaviours and practices emerged as the main barrier from \nthe factors tested through the survey.\n\n\u2022 This was supported by some of the interviewees who \nhighlighted that it can be a challenge to get citizens \ninvolved in participatory processes and decision-making \nand to ensure that a diversity of voices is represented in \nconsultation processes.\n\nTechnological barriers\n\n\u2022 While the majority of survey respondents still identified \nthese as supporting factors, big data analytics and ICT were \nseen as a barrier by some cities and as neither supporting \nnor inhibiting the sustainability transition by others.\n\n\u2022 The different views expressed and experiences could \nbe because cities may not be making use of big data or \nbecause there is a lack of government capacity to integrate \nbig data analytics and other forms of ICT into existing \ndecision-making processes. This issue was not touched \nupon much in the interviews and would require further \ninvestigation to confirm specific barriers.\n\nData and information barriers\n\n\u2022 As regards measuring progress towards sustainability, cities \nface challenges such as the timeliness (e.g. too old to be \nuseful), accessibility (e.g. format and ease of access) and \nquality (e.g. robustness, reliability, relevance, comparability, \ncompatibility) of data and information, which can create a \nbarrier to implementing their sustainability measures.\n\n\u2022 Another barrier mentioned in the interviews was the  \nlack of data available at the city level, with national- or  \nregional-level data having to be used as a proxy in some \ninstances, thus preventing more locally targeted responses.\n\nFinancial barriers\n\n\u2022 In terms of factors that were identified by some cities in the \nsurvey as inhibiting the sustainability transitions, the level of  \nfiscal decentralisation stands out as the most important barrier.\n\n\u2022 This is aligned with the findings of the interviews, in which \nlimited municipal budgets (as a result of insufficient fiscal \ndecentralisation) was repeatedly highlighted as a barrier.\n\n\u2022 Another challenge related to this was the limited ability of \nsome cities to raise their own taxes, which is exacerbated \nwhen there is a lack of political alignment between the city \nand higher tiers of government on environmental policy \npriorities (see Box 4.3).\n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n97Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nBox 4.3 EU funding allows Gabrovo to overcome limited municipal budget\n\nLow levels of fiscal decentralisation in Bulgaria mean that Gabrovo has only a very limited operating budget. This funding \nchallenge is exacerbated by the costs the city faces in providing good-quality services, such as water and sanitation, that \nmeet strict EU standards across a highly dispersed hinterland of unconnected villages.\n\nBut this has not prevented the city administration from thinking in innovative ways about its funding constraints. Gabrovo \ntoday receives more funds from the EU than any other city in Bulgaria, with EU funding making up 85 % of its operational \nprogrammes and the remaining 15 % covered by the national government. For years, Gabrovo has been at the forefront of \napplying for and accessing EU funding. This includes funding from the European Regional Development Fund for energy  \nefficiency improvements, improved green spaces and better urban infrastructure. In 2018 the city was recognised as a role model \nby Members of the European Parliament for the funding it received from the EU Cohesion Fund to upgrade its water infrastructure.\n\nGiven that most of these funds are distributed on a competitive basis, the significant number of successful EU-funded \nprojects in Gabrovo is testament to the hard work of the administration in ensuring that the city can advance its \nsustainability agenda with the help of EU funding.\n\n4.4 Lessons from the analysis of drivers of and \nbarriers to sustainability transitions\n\nThe EEA report nr 16/2020 (EEA, 2020e) aims to help improve \nunderstanding of the drivers of and barriers to achieving urban \nenvironmental sustainability in Europe. A number of early \nlessons related to the drivers of and barriers to sustainability \ntransitions in European cities have emerged from this research. \nGiven the relatively limited scope of this study, these findings \nshould be seen as a starting point for a wider conversation \nabout the drivers of and barriers to urban sustainability \ntransitions. However, the following lessons may be helpful to \npolicymakers and to other urban stakeholders, including local \ncitizens, non-governmental organisations and the research \ncommunity, in accelerating urban environmental sustainability \ntransitions across European cities:\n\n\u2022 Cities are heterogeneous and transition pathways need \nto be tailored to local contexts, as drivers and barriers \ncan differ greatly between cities. A factor that acts as a \nbarrier in one city can be a driver in another. In order to \nachieve successful urban sustainability transitions across \nEurope, the diverse needs and capacities of individual cities, \nas well as different policy and sectoral priorities, need to be \ntaken into account and supported by flexible EU, national \nand regional governance and legislative systems.\n\n\u2022 Some contextual factors are fixed and hard to change \n(e.g. climate, geographical context), but many are dynamic \nand evolving (e.g. demographics, GDP, infrastructure) and \ncan be influenced by agile policymaking and targeted policy \ninterventions. Understanding the complex relationships \nbetween the existing urban context and its constantly \nevolving nature and sustainability efforts can help cities \nto prioritise the environmental policies that will be most \nappropriate for their individual circumstances.\n\n\u2022 City governments' sustainability visions and  \nstrategic plans are vital as foundations for further \naction. Coupled with clear and measurable targets  \nand committed leadership, they can play an important  \nrole in advancing ambitious environmental goals.  \nVisions and plans should include clear development \ntrajectories and need to be aligned with wider  \nprogrammes set at national and EU levels.\n\n\u2022 EU laws and policy frameworks have a key role to  \nplay in accelerating sustainability changes in cities. \nSuch laws, standards, regulations and funding  \nopportunities provide strong incentives, support and  \neven inspiration for cities. The European Green Deal,  \nthe urban agenda for the EU and various EU directives  \n(e.g. Water Framework Directive, Energy Efficiency  \nDirective, Energy Performance of Buildings Directive)  \nall play a critical role in shaping city action. Following  \nthe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely  \nthat leadership on and funding for key sustainability  \nissues from the EU will play an even bigger role in \naccelerating change in European cities.\n\n\u2022 National and supranational governments can facilitate \n\u2014 and inhibit \u2014 systemic change to achieve urban \nsustainability transitions in cities. While they are crucial \nin fostering knowledge exchange and supporting strong \nnetworks that enable peer-to-peer learning (e.g. EGCA, \nEGLA), some cities highlighted that a lack of alignment \nbetween local, national and supranational priorities and \nobjectives can undermine progress.\n\n\u2022 Cities benefit from greater decision-making  \npowers and fiscal autonomy, particularly when  \nit comes to policy sectors that most acutely  \ninfluence local sustainability outcomes.  \n\f\nPioneering cities: learning from their experience\n\n98 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nA lack of fiscal autonomy was repeatedly highlighted \nas a barrier that limits cities' ability to accelerate their \nsustainability transitions, particularly when it comes to \nbig investments such as new transport infrastructure. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had a significant \nimpact on local government budgets, so finding innovative \nways to access local sources of revenue will have to be \ncomplemented by financial support from other tiers of \ngovernment and the private sector.\n\n\u2022 City networks and focused partnerships can add value, \nfor example through knowledge sharing and creating \nspaces for cities to learn from each other's experiences.\nThe networks work best when they encourage collaboration \nrather than competition and when it is very clear what \nvalue they add for individual member cities. Having a safe \nspace to share not only successes but also failures was \nhighlighted as an important aspect of such networks. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has also shown how city networks \ncan be essential not just for information sharing but also \nin enabling cities to speak with a unified voice, raising their \ncollective profile in important policy conversations.\n\n\u2022 Local research and experimentation can accelerate \ninnovation and is critical for identifying locally appropriate \nsolutions by using the city as a 'test bed' for new ideas.  \nIt also allows cities to think about the different sustainability \nnexuses that they want to address and to find solutions  \nthat can lead to co-benefits across critical policy sectors.  \nA supportive research agenda at the EU and national levels \nis also needed to support and reinforce efforts by  \nindividual cities.\n\n\u2022 Involving stakeholders and supporting effective public \nengagement in decision-making processes leads to \nbetter sustainability outcomes. The sense of ownership \nand shared responsibility for dealing with environmental \nchallenges can help to create a common understanding  \nof sustainability issues across various government sectors \nand levels while also fostering buy-in from the private  \nsector and the public that will encourage them to make \npositive behavioural changes in support of the  \nsustainability transition.\n\n\u2022 New technologies can play an important role but \nneed to be inclusive and fit for purpose. While new \ntechnologies are not a panacea for all environmental \nchallenges, and care must be taken to account for possible \nunintended consequences or side effects (e.g. social \nexclusion and inequality in access to goods and services), \ntechnological developments play an important role in \n\naccelerating sustainability transitions. Fostering a culture  \nof innovation and an atmosphere of creativity can help cities \nattract global technology firms while also providing the right \nenvironment for local start-ups to thrive and facilitate new \ntechnology development and implementation on the ground.\n\n\u2022 Updated and accessible data and information are \nneeded to monitor progress. This leads to better \nenvironmental management and makes it easier to \ndemonstrate how a city is advancing towards achieving its \nspecific goals. Collaborating with national and EU statistics \noffices and members of other EU networks, and complying \nwith the EU directives, helps city governments to identify \nareas where they may be lagging behind and incentivises \nthem to improve their data and information collection \nprocesses. Using new technologies to improve data \ncollection and analysis is also essential.\n\n\u2022 Communicating information effectively and \ninnovatively is an important part of engaging the \npublic. Thinking in innovative ways about how data and \ninformation can be presented to highlight challenges or new \ninitiatives can ensure that the public is clear about what the \ncity is aiming to achieve and how they can be part of the \nsustainability transition. Innovative ways of communication \ninclude more qualitative storytelling, using high-profile \n'champions' to promote more sustainable behaviours, \naccessible and attractive ways of data visualisation and \npresentation, and increased availability of open data.\n\n\u2022 Accessing EU, national and private funding plays a \ncritical role in supporting cities' sustainably transitions. \nGovernments can accelerate systemic change by reorienting \nfinancial flows towards sustainable investments and \nby developing relevant knowledge systems and skills \nto support them. While wealthier cities usually have \nmore control over their investments, for cities with less \nrevenue-generating capacities knowing how to access other \nsources of funding at EU and national levels can be an \nimportant driver of progress.\n\n\u2022 Green procurement processes and sustainable \nconsumption are important drivers of change. Green \nprocurement practices provide an opportunity for cities to \nalign public spending with core environmental objectives, \nso these processes need to be simplified and streamlined. \nInfluencing individuals to use their purchasing power for \ngood can be a challenging area for cities, but achieving \nmore sustainable consumption patterns within wider \nsociety was seen as an important complement to local \ngovernment efforts.\n\f\n99Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n\u00a9 Edgaras Vaicikevicius, My City/EEA\n\f\nUrban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change100\n\n\u00a9 Melinda Harlov, My City/EEA\n\f\n101Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n5\nKey messages for Europe  \n\nand European cities\n\nKey Messages\n\n\u2022 Cities are key in the transition to a low-carbon sustainable economy \u2014 it is estimated that 80 % of Europeans will \nlive in urban areas by 2050. Cities are centres of population, economic activity, production and consumption. Many \nsystemic environmental challenges are concentrated in cities. Yet cities can drive innovation and be at the forefront of \nthe systemic changes needed. They can act as 'test beds' for innovative policy and action and can provide opportunities \nfor coordinated interventions that can lead to changes in systems.\n\n\u2022 The need for integrated policy, networks and financial support \u2014 while cities have some autonomy in policy- and \ndecision-making, there is a need for better integration and coherence in policymaking. This applies horizontally (across \npolicy areas and sectors) and vertically (from EU to national to local scales). The EEA and European Commission can \nplay important roles in assessing and promoting environmental policy integration. Funding for sustainability actions \n(e.g. through the EU Cohesion Fund) and opportunities to learn from others and share experiences are also key.\n\n\u2022 Cities are unique, but common lessons emerge \u2014 there is a high level of heterogeneity among European cities in \nterms of their size and physical, institutional, social and political characteristics. However, common themes for drivers \nof urban sustainability include the importance of high-level strategies, visions and plans; the key role of infrastructure; \nand the value of policy and fiscal autonomy. Urban sustainability will also require governance approaches that support \ncross-sectoral working and involve relevant stakeholders.\n\n\u2022 Future research needs and opportunities \u2014 a number of research needs and opportunities are identified, including \napplying the nexus approach at different scales, such as within cities and at national and European levels; expanding \nresearch on and analysis of drivers of urban sustainability to include more cities and explore specific topics in more \ndetail; using cities to test and experiment with solutions to complex transition challenges, for example through EU and \nnational research agendas; and developing new measures of progress to urban sustainability, including composite \nindicators and measures combining quantitative and qualitative evidence.\n\n\u2022 Localising the EEA-Eionet strategy 2021-2030 \u2014 there are opportunities to localise the EEA-Eionet strategy through \nactivity focusing on urban sustainability. Key messages from stakeholder discussions include the need for the \nfollowing: co-creation with cities and their networks; integration with different levels of decision-making; timeliness \nevidence gathering to support policymaking in a proactive manner innovation by connecting with citizen and industry \ndata; equality and a focus on understanding winners and losers; and equipping cities with the capacity and skills they \nneed to develop and work with data and evidence.\n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n102 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n5.1 Urban environmental sustainability:  \na key piece in the EU transition puzzle\n\nAround three quarters of Europeans live in urban areas, and \nit is estimated that this will rise to 80 % by 2050 (EEA, 2019a). \nCities have been called the 'engines of the [EU] economy' \n(Nabielek et al., 2016), and much of Europe's production \nand imports is to meet demand originating in cities as major \nconsumers of resources and products. Cities also interact in \nmany ways with their hinterlands, for example in relation to \nfood production and supply, energy generation and movement \nof people (e.g. commuting for work). One illustration of the \nimportance of urban areas in the transition to a low-carbon \nsustainable economy is the fact that they are responsible for at \nleast 70 % of global carbon emissions (EEA, 2019b).\n\nMany systemic environmental issues and challenges are also \nconcentrated in urban areas, which face significant challenges \nrelating to, for example, air and noise pollution, resource use \nand waste, pressure on ecosystems and habitats, and ensuring \na good quality of life for all.\n\nHowever, the concentration of people, consumption and \neconomic activity in urban areas that underpins their \nimportance as drivers of many environmental issues also \nmeans that they can be key to the transition to a more \nsustainable Europe. As centres of economic activity and \npopulation, urban areas can drive innovation and be at the \nforefront of the systemic changes needed. Cities can act as \n'test beds' for innovative policy and action. Although they are \nconnected to national, European and global systems (e.g. of \nproduction and supply), urban areas are distinct systems in \ntheir own right in which opportunities exist for coordinated \ninterventions that can lead to systems change with  \nfar-reaching effects.\n\nAddressing urban sustainability challenges can also play a pivotal \nrole in achieving a range of EU policy objectives, for example:\n\n\u2022 Developing green infrastructure is a key step towards \nensuring the success of the European Commission's green \ninfrastructure strategy and the EU biodiversity strategy \nfor\u00a02030.\n\n\u2022 Mainstreaming urban adaptation strategies (e.g. in land \nuse planning) can help to achieve the objectives of the EU \nadaptation strategy.\n\n\u2022 Encouraging active transport modes, public transport \nand car-sharing/-pooling schemes can help meet the EU \nAmbient Air Quality Directive targets and deliver the  \nlow-emission mobility strategy.\n\n\u2022 Minimising waste generation and maintaining the use and \nvalue of products, materials, built assets and land can help \nto meet the objectives of the EU action plan for the circular \neconomy.\n\n\u2022 The transition to decentralised clean energy production in \ncities will help to meet the objectives of the EU 2030 climate \nand energy framework.\n\nBy addressing challenges and progressing these and other \npolicy objectives, cities will play a key role in delivering the \nurban agenda for the EU.\n\n5.2 Key overall messages for European policy \nand action\n\n5.2.1 The need for vertical and horizontal policy \nintegration\n\nCities and urban areas have a key role in supporting the \ntransition to a resilient and low-carbon sustainable economy \nin Europe, including as part of an overall green recovery from \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. However, they require a consistent \npolicy framework. The nexus analysis and assessment of \ndrivers highlight the importance of higher-level (e.g. national, \nEuropean) priorities and objectives being aligned and  \nconsistent \u2014 vertical integration:\n\n\u2022 The response to key systemic environmental challenges  \nfor Europe and in cities, such as climate change, mobility  \nor resource use, are dictated or influenced by a range  \nof stakeholders and policy frameworks set at different  \nspatial scales.\n\n\u2022 Cities can achieve much on their own, but their efforts will \nbe much more likely to succeed if their actions are aligned \nwith clearly defined EU and national frameworks, standards \nand guidelines that support action at the city (and other \nlocal area) scale.\n\n\u2022 In some policy areas (e.g. climate, energy, circular economy) \nthe role of European and national policy is important, as \nmany aspects will be beyond the ability of individual cities \nto influence. There is a need to ensure that higher-level \npolicy is coherent and integrated such that the goals and \ntargets in different policy areas are not conflicting. Ensuring \nthat environmental policy goals are integrated into other \nsectoral policy (such as transport and energy) would help \nprovide coherence. The EEA and European Commission \ncan play important roles in assessing and promoting \nenvironmental policy integration.\n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n103Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n\u2022 Other support, in the form of networks, research and \nfunding will also be key (see Section 5.2.2).\n\nThe nexus analysis emphasises the potential for positive and \nnegative interactions between policy areas and the need for \ncross-silo and cross-sectoral coordination and alignment with \ncities \u2014 horizontal integration:\n\n\u2022 Within cities this is key to the prioritisation of policy and \naction and critical to the realisation of co-benefits and \nminimisation of trade-offs (see Section 5.3.4).\n\n\u2022 There are myriad interactions between interventions \nand sectors; however, a relatively small number of \npolicy agendas can be identified through which urban \nenvironmental sustainability can be achieved (see \nTable\u00a03.10 in Chapter 3). The policy agendas cut across \ntraditional policy areas and require coordinated action  \nfrom both public and private sectors.\n\nThe research and analysis completed for this report also \nhighlight the critical role of people in successful transitions:\n\n\u2022 In cities policies related to, for example, mobility, climate \nand energy, or to the circular economy, will not succeed \nwithout the acceptance and support of citizens.\n\n\u2022 This means understanding distributional effects (e.g. on the \nmost vulnerable) and involving citizens and communities in \ndesigning and implementing policy and action that affects \nthem (see also Section 5.3.3). \n\n5.2.2 Support for urban environmental sustainability \nin Europe\n\nAlthough the analysis of drivers and nexuses indicates the value \nof cities having autonomy in how they address sustainability \nissues, it is also clear that cities need support in the form of \nhigh-level visions and strategies, funding for sustainability \nactions and opportunities to learn from others and share \nexperiences:\n\n\u2022 International initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) \nSustainable Development Goals and UN urban agenda \nare considered important by cities in providing high-level \nframing and prioritisation.\n\n\u2022 EU laws, standards and regulations also strongly \nshape local sustainability ambitions and actions. The \ndrivers assessment shows that cities are incentivised, \n\nsupported and inspired by EU legislation and strategies \nsuch as the European Green Deal and the EU urban \nagenda and EU environmental directives (e.g. Water \nFramework Directive, Energy Efficiency Directive, Energy \nPerformance of  \nBuildings Directive).\n\n\u2022 Implementing urban sustainability transitions will \nrequire investment, and many urban areas will require \nfinancial support to realise their transition ambitions. A \nrange of options exist including the EU LIFE programme, \nthe European Regional Development Fund, the \nEuropean Investment Bank and funds such as Jessica \n(Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in \nCity Areas), the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment Green Cities programme and the Next \nGeneration EU recovery package (particularly associated \nwith recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic). The \neconomic and investment implications of COVID-19 are \nlikely to increase the importance of external funding for \nurban environmental sustainability measures.\n\n\u2022 Networks are also increasingly important within Europe \nand between European and global cities for the sharing \nof knowledge and experiences in finding solutions and \novercoming barriers. Key networks include EuroCities, \nLocal Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) Europe, \nUnited Cities and Local Governments, Metropolis, the \nC40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and the Global \nCovenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy.\n\n\u2022 EU initiatives, such as the proposed European urban \ninitiative, part of the 2021-2027 EU programming \nperiod, are important mechanisms to support cities with \ncapacity building, innovative solutions, knowledge, policy \ndevelopment and communication.\n\n\u2022 European awards, especially the European Green Capital \nAward and the European Green Leaf Award, are also \nseen as an important means of facilitating knowledge \nexchange and networks that enable peer-to-peer \nlearning and best practice.\n\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the value  \nof city networks in sharing knowledge and information  \nand providing a common voice for cities in important  \npolicy conversations. Good examples are the C40 Global \nMayors COVID-19 Recovery Taskforce (C40 Cities 2020b)  \nand calls from the Global Covenant of Mayors and \nEuroCities (EuroCities 2020) for a green recovery  \nand cross-border solidarity.\n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n104 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n5.2.3 COVID-19 is creating challenges and \nopportunities for European cities\n\nCOVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching implications for \nthe functioning of cities and the lives of their residents. It is a \nchallenge of unprecedented proportions, and cities have been \nat the frontline of managing the crisis. European cities have \nbeen bearing some of the worst impacts of the crisis but are \nalso becoming key actors in proactively advocating for a green \nand just recovery.\n\nThere is still considerable uncertainty about the longer-term \nimpacts for cities. However, a growing agenda of issues that will \nhave to be tackled in the months and years ahead is beginning \nto emerge. All of these will have an impact on environmental \nsustainability transitions in cities (ICLEI, 2020).\n\nThese include, for example, what a green recovery looks like \nfor different types of cities; new requirements for the design of \nthe public realm and green spaces and how this links to urban \nadaptation; opportunities and challenges presented by new \nforms of mobility and wider questions of urban accessibility; \nchanges in urban functions (e.g. homes becoming the hub of \nday-to-day life and office buildings being converted to housing); \nthe impact on local businesses and service providers (e.g. less \ninner-city footfall); the role of technology and digital futures in \nthe context of a just transition; urban and regional production \nand value chains and their link to the circular economy; and \nconsiderations of new forms of urban decision-making.\n\nIt is hoped that the European Green Deal will provide the \nframework that will support a green recovery. Some initial key \nlessons from the COVID-19 pandemic for cities include:\n\n\u2022 Cities are facing a triple crisis in the wake of the pandemic: \ntackling the health impacts of COVID-19; dealing with the \nclimate and ecological emergency; and addressing social \nand economic inequality. Despite these challenges, they \nhave the potential to become a major driving force for a \ngreen and just recovery in Europe \u2014 provided that they  \nare actively involved in the decision-making process from \nthe beginning.\n\n\u2022 While it is too early to know what some of the longer-term \nlegacy of the pandemic will be when it comes to \nurban environmental sustainability, it is clear that the \nunprecedented EUR 1.8 trillion stimulus package agreed  \nby the EU will reshape cities in fundamental ways.\n\n\u2022 Infrastructure investment will play an important role \nin stimulating urban economic activity after the crisis, \ncreating an opportunity to align the recovery with climate, \nenvironmental and social equity agendas in cities. This will \nneed to be accompanied by better integration of policy \nsectors and actions to maximise the co-benefits.\n\nKey opportunities for a green and just recovery appear in \nthe following sectors: rethinking urban mobility and land \nuse; retrofitting the urban building stock; enhancing the role \nof green infrastructure and nature-based solutions; and \ntransforming urban food systems and the circular economy.\n\n5.3 Key messages for urban policy and \ngovernance\n\nLooking across the nexus analysis and assessment of  \ndrivers and barriers, five key messages for urban policy  \nand governance emerge.\n\n5.3.1 Cities are unique and will have their own \ntransition pathways\n\nEurope has two megacities (London and Paris), 26 cities with \na population of more than 1 million, and more than 800 cities \nwith a population of 50 000 or more (Nabielek et al., 2016; \nEC and UN-Habitat, 2016). Given this range and each city's \nphysical, institutional, social and political characteristics, there \nis a high degree of heterogeneity among European cities and a \nresulting diversity in the pathways to urban sustainability:\n\n\u2022 Larger urban areas and cities often have more autonomy, \ncapacity and resources to develop and implement \nsustainability measures, and to access funding, awards and \nnetworks or participate in research. By contrast smaller \ncities may lack some capacity for achieving sustainability \ntransitions and may also face challenges due to having less \nfinancial and political autonomy than larger cities. Smaller \ncities and urban areas may therefore require greater \nsupport from national and EU governments and may also \nbenefit from working together, for example within regions.\n\n\u2022 Contextual factors will influence and interact with \nsustainability objectives, and understanding them can \nhelp cities prioritise environmental policy and action. A \nclear finding from the nexus analysis and drivers research \nis that a good understanding of a city's context, and its \nconstantly evolving nature, are prerequisites for successful \nsustainability planning.\n\n\u2022 Some aspects of cities' context will be largely beyond \nany one city's ability to change, for example where they \nare fixed, such as geography or topography, or happen \nat a European or global scale, such as climate change. \nUnderstanding and embracing the influence of such factors \ncan help shape efforts more effectively in addressing \nsustainability transitions.\n\n\u2022 Other urban contextual aspects may evolve, and cities will \nbe more able to influence them, for example city size and \n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n105Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nform, inequality and poverty or institutional arrangements. \nSuch aspects will evolve of their own accord because of the \ninfluence of external factors such as demographic changes \nor national or European economic growth, thus presenting \nemerging challenges (and opportunities). However, they can \nalso be shaped by the actions of urban authorities.\n\n\u2022 That cities are unique and will have their own transition \npathways is also important for EU and national policy \nframeworks and legislation. It suggests that, while clarity is \nrequired, the options for local implementation also need to \nbe flexible, so that cities can develop and deliver policy and \naction in ways that are relevant and effective for them. \n\n5.3.2 Themes emerge in relation to key drivers of and \nactions for urban sustainability\n\nWhile an understanding of the existing urban characteristics \nand context will shape the priorities in individual cities \nand dictate to some extent what may be achievable, some \ncommon themes emerge from the research into drivers of \nurban environmental sustainability and the actions cities have \ntaken and plan to take. Looking across the nexus analysis and \nassessment of drivers, the following themes can be seen:\n\n\u2022 The development of overall urban sustainability \nstrategies, visions and plans is seen as a key prerequisite \nfor a successful transition, together with local political \nleadership. Strategies and plans could be sectoral \n(e.g. buildings, climate, transport), but coordinated, \ncross-sectoral action and the prioritisation of policy that \nconsiders interactions between sectors and sectoral \nobjectives is key to a successful transition (see also \nSection\u00a05.3.4)\n\n\u2022 The physical infrastructure of a city is one of the key barriers \n(e.g. car-centric transport infrastructure) but also a driver \nof and opportunity for urban sustainability. Re-imagining \nand redesigning the transport infrastructure (e.g. allocating \nroad space to active travel), public spaces (e.g. increasing \naccess to green space and building in flood protection) \nand buildings (e.g. retrofitting for energy efficiency \nand generation of renewables) will be key to achieving \nsustainability transitions in most cities.\n\n\u2022 The ability to make local policy decisions and a degree of \nfiscal autonomy can benefit cities' urban sustainability \ntransitions, by enabling local revenue generation and \nactions, investment and economic signals (taxes, incentives) \nto focus on local needs and objectives.\n\n\u2022 Green public procurement is identified as a key area of \naction and a driver in both the nexus analysis and the \nassessment of drivers. Through the use of standards \n\nand requirements in procurement, cities can influence a \nrange of environmental sustainability outcomes, including \nresource use and waste generation (supporting the circular \neconomy), climate adaptation and mitigation, sustainable \nbuildings and clean energy.\n\n\u2022 Collaborative working, cross-sectoral governance and \neffective working between the public and private sectors, \ncivil society and communities also emerges as an important \nenabling factor and driver of effective transitions in cities \n(see also Section 5.3.3).\n\n\u2022 As noted in Section 5.2.2, international treaties and EU laws, \nstandards and regulations are strong enabling factors for \nurban environmental sustainability, together with national \nlaws, standards and regulations and the degree of political \nautonomy a city has. \n\n5.3.3 New approaches to governance\n\nAddressing the challenges of achieving urban sustainability \nrequires governance approaches that combine short- and \nlong-term goals and facilitate effective working across sectors \nand between different stakeholder groups:\n\n\u2022 The assessment of drivers highlights that involving \nstakeholders from various sectors and across all levels of \ngovernment and society in decision-making leads to better \noutcomes in terms of urban environmental sustainability \ntransitions. Participatory approaches to governance \ncan build ownership of and shared responsibility for \nenvironmental challenges and the measures required to \naddress them.\n\n\u2022 Engaging urban communities and residents is also key: \nany transformational change will require the participation \nof a city's population to succeed. In many cases it is the \nsocially and economically vulnerable who have most to \ngain from sustainability transitions, as they often face the \ngreatest exposure to environmental risks (e.g. air and noise \npollution, poor housing, limited access to green space). \nHowever, the effects of fundamental changes will also be \ndistributed unevenly, and understanding and reflecting \nthese, and the needs of the most vulnerable in society, is \ncritical to maximise the benefits and avoid exacerbating \ninequalities.\n\n\u2022 Being transparent and providing clear, understandable \ninformation on policies and measures proposed can help \nempower individuals and engage them in the changes \nneeded. This may include their own behaviours and \nchoices but also acceptance of innovative ways of working, \ntechnologies or infrastructure changes that may challenge \nhabits and current patterns of life. Transformational \n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n106 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nsystemic change will only happen in cities when people  \nare at its heart. \n\n5.3.4 The multiplier effect of coordinated action\n\nThe analysis of eight selected nexuses has the key objective of \nbetter understanding the interactions between selected policy \nareas such that trade-offs and co-benefits can be identified and, \nimportantly, policy and associated action prioritised.\n\n\u2022 By exploring the selected nexuses, high-level relationships \nand interactions can be seen. They have thematic and \nhierarchical links, with the key point being that achieving \nany one nexus objective can, if interactions are considered, \ndeliver or support other nexus objectives. However, the \nopposite is also true: if the interactions and trade-offs are \nignored, action in one area risks undermining progress \nin others. This latter situation can be considered perhaps \nto be a common issue in current policy and action for \nsustainability in cities (and at other scales).\n\n\u2022 At the level of specific policy and measures, the nexus \nanalysis identifies 15 key policy agendas that each help \nto deliver at least two nexus objectives (e.g. enhancing \nclimate resilience and improving quality of life and health); \nsee Table 3.10. Taken together, these provide a thorough \noverview of the key areas for strategic intervention \nand policy coordination in urban areas where multiple \nobjectives can be delivered through coordinated action.\n\n\u2022 Coordinated action that is explicitly designed to minimise \ntrade-offs (negative effects in other areas) and maximise \nco-benefits (positive effects in other areas) can also support \ncost-effective interventions. Generating multiple benefits \ndoes not necessarily mean that delivery is cost-effective; \nhowever, it seems likely that minimising trade-offs and \nprioritising policy that maximises co-benefits will deliver \ncost-effective outcomes. \n\n5.3.5 Technology, data and information challenges \nand opportunities for cities\n\nTechnological innovation and digitalisation are seen as a \npotentially important enabler of sustainability transitions, \nparticularly in some sectors and systems (e.g. energy, mobility). \nHowever, technologies also bring challenges and will in \nthemselves have impacts, for example:\n\n\u2022 Electrification and the introduction of smart technologies, \nsuch as in mobility, will increase the demand for electricity \nand also the need to produce and use new products and \ndevices that will have energy and resource implications \n\nthemselves in and beyond cities, which should not be \noverlooked.\n\n\u2022 Digitalisation will have social implications too, including \nfor inclusion and equity (e.g. due to differential access to \ntechnologies and the skills required to use them) and for \ndata use and privacy. This could lead to resistance or a lack \nof uptake, undermining progress. Solutions that maintain or \nworsen social inequalities should be avoided.\n\n\u2022 Developments in information and communications \ntechnology (ICT) and smart technologies can provide \nopportunities for monitoring and measuring progress \nin, or close to, real time. This can potentially address the \nchallenges that many cities face in accessing data that are \naligned with, and timely enough, to inform decision-making \naround complex environmental issues. However, this does \nrequire cities to have access to and the capacity to integrate \nsuch technologies in existing (sometimes ageing) systems \nand infrastructure, and the skills and capacity to use them.\n\n\u2022 Cities should seek to harness technologies that are \nsupportive of environmental sustainability (e.g. enhanced \nmonitoring of environmental problems, improvements in \nthe efficiency of renewable energy systems) but be cautious \nof seeing technology as a solution to all environmental \nchallenges.\n\nLow-technology solutions may be more effective in some \ncontexts, for example reallocating road space to active travel \nmay be cheaper to implement yet have a greater impact on \nthe sustainability of mobility than smart traffic management \nsystems. Likewise using nature-based solutions to manage \nheat, provide natural shading or mitigate flood risks may be \nmore effective than technological solutions, especially when \nthe co-benefits for nature, human health and quality of life are \nconsidered.\n\n5.4 Future research needs and opportunities\n\nThis report has provided an initial overview of urban \nenvironmental sustainability in Europe. It brings together \ninformation and evidence on the importance and role of cities \nand urban areas in delivering the EU's sustainability transition; \non the support for urban environmental sustainability in \nEurope; on how urban environmental sustainability can be \nanalysed and assessed and lessons from the two approaches \npresented in the report (the analysis of selected urban nexuses, \nand an assessment of drivers and barriers in cities); and on \nkey messages for policy and urban governance. However, \nthe findings and emerging lessons should be seen as only a \nstarting point for a wider conversation about the transition \ntowards urban environmental sustainability. Further research is \nneeded to develop a more definitive overview of the multitude \n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n107Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\nof complex and interrelated factors that shape sustainability \noutcomes in European cities. Some further research needs that \nemerge from this initial work that the EEA and other interested \nparties may wish to explore are outlined below.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has also added to the urgency of this type \nof research, given that cities are currently facing unprecedented \npressures to respond to deeply interlinked health, social, \neconomic and environmental challenges. There is a real risk \nthat the gains made in recent years in urban environmental \nsustainability transitions may either slow down or even be \nreversed unless cities are supported in their efforts to 'build \nback better'.\n\n5.4.1 Develop the application of the nexus approach at \ndifferent scales\n\nAlmost all decisions at the city level are in some ways \ninterrelated, which highlights the importance of a systems \nperspective when thinking about urban sustainability. \nRecognising interrelationships across the different elements \nof urban sustainability (i.e. nexus) can thus be an important \nstarting point for cities to explore progress towards their \nsustainability objectives.\n\nThe priority objectives for urban environmental sustainability \nwill vary among European cities given their different contexts \n(e.g. historical, physical, social and institutional). Therefore, \ncities should seek to establish their own nexuses and explore \nprogress towards their prioritised sustainability objectives.\n\nOn a larger scale, the development and analysis of nexuses \ncould also come from both European and national levels. \nThe European topic centres (ETCs) could have a key role in \ncoordinating this process. By doing this, the approach could \nbe developed, for example by integrating the measurement \nof progress towards urban environmental sustainability (see \nalso Section 5.4.4). Further testing by national governments \ncould also provide a better understanding of environmental \nsustainability in selected cities in their territory and be fed back \nto inform the overall approach.\n\n5.4.2 Expand the analysis on drivers of urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions\n\nThe findings and emerging lessons from the meta-analysis \nsummarised in Chapter 4 and presented in the report \nSustainable European Cities (SEC) \u2014 Understanding the drivers  \nof urban environmental sustainability transitions should only  \n\nbe seen as a starting point for a wider conversation about the \ndrivers of urban sustainability transitions. Further research will \nbe needed to develop a more definitive overview of the multitude \nof complex and interrelated factors that shape sustainability \noutcomes in European cities. Looking ahead, there are a number \nof important pieces of follow-up work that emerge from this \ninitial analysis that the EEA and other interested parties may wish \nto explore, including:\n\n\u2022 Expanding the survey to include more cities \u2014 the first \nand most obvious opportunity would be to roll out the survey \nto a wider selection of European cities, thus ensuring that \nthere is a larger sample size and the experiences of cities \nthat are at an earlier stage of their sustainability journey are \nincluded.\n\n\u2022 Interviewing a wider range of cities or using interviews \nas 'deep dives' into specific topics \u2014 as with the \nsurvey, it would be valuable to expand the number of city \nrepresentatives interviewed, including to understand the \nperspectives of cities that may either be at a much earlier \nstage in their sustainability journey or of cities that are \npotentially struggling with particular barriers. In addition, \nfurther interviews might be used as deep dives to better \nunderstand the specifics of a particular driver or barrier in \nrelation to different topics.\n\n\u2022 Linking the findings to major new EU policy initiatives \n\u2014\u00a0the research was completed ahead of the publication of \na number of important EU initiatives, including the revised \nLeipzig Charter and the European Green Deal. It would \nbe useful to analyse to what extent the key findings from \nthis piece of work are aligned with the priorities set out \nin these new policy documents and to use this to identify \nimportant gaps in which the efforts of cities to transition \nmight be better supported through existing EU initiatives \nand legislation.\n\n\u2022 Linking the findings to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the \nsurvey and interviews were completed before the coronavirus \npandemic swept across Europe. Research into the types of \nrecovery packages that will allow us to 'build back better', \nwhile also accelerating progress towards environmental \nsustainability in Europe's cities will be of critical importance, \nand this report could provide a starting point for these \ndiscussions. Of course, the emergence of COVID-19 has \nalso fundamentally changed priorities across European \ncities \u2014 repeating this research and comparing how drivers \nand barriers may have changed over the past year would \ntherefore also be a valuable approach.\n\f\nKey messages for Europe and European cities\n\n108 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 Avenues for change\n\n\u2022 Exploring wider themes and subject areas that may be \ndriving the sustainability transition \u2014 there were some \nthemes that did not emerge clearly from this research or \nwere not within its scope and would benefit from further \nresearch, including:\n\n\u2022 how differences in planning and urban development \ncontexts between different cities may shape their \nsustainability transitions;\n\n\u2022 governance for transformation, including discussions  \nof how cities are creating a climate for innovation within \nlocal/regional authorities and the difference between \nmore top-down leadership on sustainability versus more \nbottom-up drivers emerging from civil society and the public;\n\n\u2022 understanding interlinkages between drivers of \nenvironmental sustainability transitions and social and \neconomic drivers; and\n\n\u2022 the role of lock-ins and path dependencies and how \ncities might be supported to move from incremental \nimprovements and a fairly linear progress to more \ntransformative action and accelerated change. \n\n5.4.3 Cities as a test bed for innovative action\n\nIn their efforts to achieve sustainability objectives cities are facing  \ninherently complex transitions and problems that can be difficult to \nsolve or have unintended trade-offs. Research and experimentation \nare critical to identifying locally appropriate solutions:\n\n\u2022 Using the city as a test bed can accelerate innovation, \nbecause it ensures that new approaches and technologies \nare appropriate for the local context. It also enables cities  \nto identify different sustainability nexuses and find solutions \nthat can lead to co-benefits across different policy sectors.\n\n\u2022 The EU- and national-level research agendas need to \nsupport and reinforce efforts made by individual cities to \nachieve their sustainability transitions. Existing research \nshould also provide important insights into issues that  \nare shared by a wide range of cities.\n\n\u2022 If a city has an integrated strategic vision, that can help  \nto create a common understanding of sustainability issues \nacross all sectors of government. This could ensure that \n\nsustainability issues are not dealt with in a 'siloed way'  \nbut instead become a shared responsibility.\n\n5.4.4 The need for new measures of progress to urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nMeasuring progress towards achieving urban environmental \nsustainability is essential to better understand the  \neffectiveness of policies and measures used to achieve  \nthe sustainability objectives. However, measuring  \nsustainability can be challenging and may require new \nmeasures to enable comprehensive analysis of urban \nenvironmental sustainability:\n\n\u2022 There is an abundance of quantitative contextual indicators \nfocusing on a single topic (e.g. environmental quality, land \nuse, transport and energy) in an urban context. However, \ncities using cross-sectoral analysis (e.g. a nexus approach) \nwould benefit from using of more complex composite \nindicators. For example, a composite resilience metric \nsuitable for European cities could facilitate analysis of \nclimate resilience. Establishing such indicators should be  \na priority to provide extensive evidence on the challenges  \nof achieving urban sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Some objectives of urban sustainability could make \nuse of the application of qualitative evidence as well as \nquantitative evidence. For example, using quantitative \nindicators to assess quality of life aspects of urban \nenvironments will not provide a comprehensive \ncharacterisation of this aspect.\n\n\u2022 Many existing indicators on topics of interest are not \nexclusively focused on urban areas. If such indicators are  \nto be used as a standardised measurement, they would \nneed to be available for only urban areas. \n\n5.4.5 Localising the EEA-Eionet strategy 2021-2030\n\nIn January 2021 the EEA published its EEA-Eionet strategy for \nthe period 2021-2030 (EEA, 2021). The strategic vision is that \nby 2030 the EEA and Eionet will 'enable a sustainable Europe \nthrough trusted and actionable knowledge for informed \ndecision-making on priorities and solutions, in line with \nEurope's policy ambitions'.

However, the \nresearch for this report and the development of the EEA's \napproach to urban environmental sustainability was largely \nfinalised before the coronavirus emerged in Europe.\n\nWe know that cities have been at the forefront of the health \ncrisis from the very beginning, not only bearing the worst \nimpacts but also becoming essential actors in proactively \nand innovatively addressing the health emergency, as well as \ndealing with the wider social and economic ramifications. It is \nclear that city, national and EU budgets will come under strain \nas a result of the economic crisis, which may result in reduced \nbudgets for core environmental initiatives in the years ahead.\n\nAt the same time, many policies that have been implemented \nprimarily to deal with the health emergency will also have \nlong-term environmental benefits (e.g. improved active travel \ninfrastructure), and there is a growing movement of cities \nin Europe actively committing to a green recovery from the \ncrisis \u2014 supported by initiatives at the EU level, such as the \nEuropean Green Deal.\n\nAs regards cultural shifts, similar uncertainties exist. While \npeople may be more attuned to the importance of clean \nair and high-quality green spaces, we are also seeing, for \nexample, growth in single-use plastics, and a renewed \npreference for the use of private cars over public transport, \nwhich may have serious environmental consequences.\n\nWhat is clear is that, for most Europeans, the pandemic \nhas caused abrupt changes in daily routines that will have \nfar-reaching consequences for cities. For many urban dwellers, \nworking from home has become the new normal, video \nconferences have replaced face-to-face meetings (and related \nbusiness travel), online shopping is taking over from physical \nretail, and people are becoming better acquainted with their \nimmediate neighbourhoods and local green spaces.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is clearly a challenge of \nunprecedented proportions, while also offering a \nwindow of opportunity that may accelerate sustainability \ntransformations in cities. From the perspective of both \nresearch and practice, it is clear that there is a long agenda \nof issues that will have to be tackled in the months and \nyears ahead. These include, for example, what a green \nrecovery looks like for different cities; the meaning of \nurbanity and the appropriate mix of land uses; new \nrequirements for the design of the public realm and \ngreen spaces; opportunities and challenges presented \nby new modes of transport; changes in urban functions \n(e.g.\u00a0homes becoming the hub of day-to-day life and office \nbuildings being converted to housing); the impact on local \nbusiness and service providers (e.g. less inner-city footfall); \nthe role of technology and digital futures; urban and \nregional production and value chains; and considerations \nof new forms of urban decision-making.\n\nWhile current efforts are rightly focused on tackling \nthe immediate challenges posed by the pandemic, it \nis important to swiftly put in place recovery pathways \nthat align with wider sustainability objectives. The EU's \nambition of climate neutrality by 2050 and its European \nGreen Deal must stay on track, while continuing \nto recognise the profound societal changes we \nare\u00a0undergoing.\n\nMoving forward, it will be ever more important to ensure \na fair transition for all while rebuilding our economies \nsustainably. Cities are at the centre of future environmental \nchallenges, and therefore there is an urgent need for \nEuropean cities to shift towards a more integrated \napproach to addressing persistent, systemic environmental \nchallenges. The EU also has a key role in promoting \nsustainable urban development, a role clearly recognised by \nthe EU Urban Agenda. This has important implications for \ncities when it comes to the transformation of systems that \nwill be required to tackle the climate and ecological crisis in \nthe years to come.\n\f\n\u00a9 Josef Hinterleitner, My City/EEA\n\f\n7Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\n1 \nWhy is the EEA interested \n\nin\u00a0cities?\n\n1.1 The European context\n\nEurope is a highly urbanised continent: it is estimated that \nthe share of the EU population living in urban areas is \ncurrently\u00a074\u00a0%, and this is predicted to rise to 80\u00a0% in 2050 \n(EEA, 2019a). Historically, the urban population in Europe has \nbeen growing over the last half-century. Much of this growth \nhas been in towns and suburbs, especially in newly developed \nresidential areas surrounding existing cities (Nabielek \net\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). However, since 2000, an increasing number \nof\u00a0European cities (e.g. in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, \nGermany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden) have had \nhigher annual population growth in their urban cores than in \ntheir commuting zones (OECD, 2018; Salvati et al., 2019).\n\nThe urban landscape of Europe is characterised by a diversity of \nsmall, medium and large cities (Nabielek et al., 2016). There are \njust over 800 cities in the EU with more than 50\u00a0000 inhabitants \n(Heinelt, 2017). The majority of these, almost 700, are small and \nmedium-sized cities (between 50\u00a0000 and 250\u00a0000 inhabitants) \n(Nabielek et al., 2016). At the other end of the scale, there are \n26 cities in the EU with a population of more than one million. \nOne in eight Europeans live in these largest cities (EC, 2012). \nOf these cities, only Paris and London can be considered \nmegacities \u2014\u00a0high-density metropolises of more than 10 million \ninhabitants (EC and UN-Habitat, 2016).\n\nEurope's varying urban structure is a product of many \nunderlying factors, including the historical development of \nsettlements, their location and geographical characteristics, \nand their function and various political, demographic and \neconomic developments. However, while overall Europe is \nhighly urbanised there is both a high degree of heterogeneity \namong its cities and also varying levels of urbanisation from \ncountry to country. Many urban regions have numerous towns \nand cities in close proximity \u2014 a polycentric structure \u2014 others \nare characterised by a single large city, often the capital city, \ndominating its surroundings \u2014 a monocentric structure. There \nare also some examples of a more linear urban pattern, for \nexample along the Mediterranean and Adriatic coasts (Nabielek \net al., 2016).\n\nIn general, western and northern Europe are more urbanised \nthan the rest of Europe. The most urbanised region of Europe \n\nis an area forming a pentagon with its apexes in London, Paris, \nMilan, Munich and Hamburg. In countries such as Belgium, \nGermany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, more \nthan three quarters of the population lives in urban areas. In \ncontrast, other countries, such as Poland, Romania, Slovakia \nand Slovenia, are less urbanised, with more than 40\u00a0% of the \npopulation living in rural areas (Nabielek et al., 2016).\n\n1.2 The urban environmental challenge\n\nEuropeans have adopted an urban lifestyle partly to benefit \nfrom the amenities cities provide, such as cultural, educational \nand health services, as well as the economic opportunities cities \noffer as the engines of Europe's economy. However, cities do \nnot operate in isolation: they rely on the regions outside the \ncity to meet their demand for resources, such as energy, water \nand food, and to dispose of and disperse waste and emissions \n(EEA,\u00a02017a).\n\nThis context poses a significant challenge: how to accommodate \nmore people in urban areas while reducing the impact on \nthe environment and being resilient to a changing climate, \nand at the same time improving the quality of life of urban \nresidents. Meeting this challenge and achieving the objective \nof urban sustainability \u2014 i.e. efficient and smartly planned, \ndesigned, renovated, managed and governed cities \u2014 is likely \nto require a radical transformation of the current model of \nurban development and a more people-oriented approach \n(EEA,\u00a02017a).\n\nSome of the main environmental challenges facing European \ncities include the emissions they produce, levels of air and \nnoise pollution, increasing energy use, the consumption of \nwater and materials, land take and habitat fragmentation \n(see Table 1.1, which includes examples of the challenges \ncities face). Urban areas are major consumers of energy \nand account for 60-80\u00a0% of global energy consumption \n(UN-Habitat, 2019). The consumption of water varies \nconsiderably across European cities, from an average \nconsumption in Madrid of 263\u00a0litres per person per day \nand 164\u00a0litres per day in London to 100\u00a0litres per day in \nCopenhagen (Carranza and Bueno, 2018; Greater London \nAuthority, 2020; IWA, 2020). On average, households across \n\f\nWhy is the EEA interested in\u00a0cities? \n\n8 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nEuropean cities use nearly three times more water (144\u00a0litres \nper person per day) than the minimum required for basic \nhuman needs (50\u00a0litres per person per day) (EEA, 2018a).\n\nAlthough emissions of air pollutants have declined in recent \nyears, almost 20\u00a0% of the EU's urban population lives in areas \nwhere air pollutant concentrations exceed at least one EU air \nquality standard (e.g. PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter \nof 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm or less), PM10 (PM with a diameter of 10\u00a0\u03bcm or less), \nO3 (ozone), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)) (EEA, 2019a). Urban areas \nare also responsible for at least 70\u00a0% of global carbon emissions \n(EEA, 2019b).\n\nAs a result of land take, urban areas may severely hamper \necosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services \n\n(EEA, 2016a). The increase in land take for urban development \nis an ongoing process across Europe, with the total urban area \nexpanding by approximately 6.7\u00a0% between 2000 and 2018 at \nthe expense of agricultural and semi-natural areas. Urban areas \nconsumed 0.6\u00a0% of all arable land and permanent crops, 0.5\u00a0% \nof all pastures and mosaic farmland, and 0.3\u00a0% of all grasslands. \nIn the EU-27 and the UK, between 2000 and 2018, urban sprawl \nconverted 0.5\u00a0% of all pastures and mosaic farmland and 0.3\u00a0% \nof all grassland into artificial surfaces (EEA, 2016b).\n\nCities are at the centre of future environmental challenges, and \ntherefore there is an urgent need for European cities to shift \ntowards a more integrated approach to addressing persistent, \nsystemic environmental challenges. The EU has a key role in \npromoting sustainable urban development; however, it is city \n\nTable 1.1 Examples of potential challenges facing cities \n\nEnvironmental challenges \nOther challenges with environmental \nimplications or that can increase vulnerability to \nenvironmental\u00a0challenges\n\n\u2022 Heat waves\n\n\u2022 Sea level rise\n\n\u2022 Severe storms and flooding\n\n\u2022 Water consumption and shortages/droughts\n\n\u2022 Forest fires\n\n\u2022 Air pollution\n\n\u2022 Water pollution\n\n\u2022 Ground contamination\n\n\u2022 Noise pollution\n\n\u2022 Light pollution\n\n\u2022 Energy consumption and shortages\n\n\u2022 Clean drinking water\n\n\u2022 Timber, mineral and other natural resource and \nmaterial consumption and shortages\n\n\u2022 Land/soil erosion\n\n\u2022 Food shortages/access to food\n\n\u2022 Solid waste processing\n\n\u2022 Solid waste disposal\n\n\u2022 Sewage treatment and disposal\n\n\u2022 Stormwater management\n\n\u2022 Habitat fragmentation\n\n\u2022 Decline of native species/natural habitats\n\n\u2022 Land take\n\n\u2022 Lack/loss of green space\n\n\u2022 Lack/loss of ecologically productive land\n\n\u2022 Urban sprawl\n\n\u2022 Overcrowding and population density\n\n\u2022 Inadequate or absent infrastructure\n\n\u2022 Community severance (a physical and psychological \nbarrier created by, for example, roads or rail \ninfrastructure)\n\n\u2022 Road congestion\n\n\u2022 Social exclusion and inequality\n\n\u2022 Unemployment rates\n\n\u2022 Lack of affordable housing\n\n\u2022 Insufficient public services\n\n\u2022 Non-communicable diseases (e.g. heart disease, \ncancer, asthma, diabetes)\n\n\u2022 Poor mental health\n\n\u2022 Demographic change\n\n\u2022 Health pandemics \n\f\nWhy is the EEA interested in\u00a0cities? \n\n9Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nadministrations that are likely to be best placed to take local \naction to tackle and resolve many of these issues (EEA, 2017a). \nThey are crucial in improving waste and water management, \npublic transport and efficient use of land by implementing \nintegrated urban planning (EEA, 2015). Furthermore, city \nnetworks and associations are becoming increasingly important \nin shaping global climate and sustainability agreements \n(EEA,\u00a02020a).\n\nDespite the central role of urban authorities, they cannot tackle \nthe complex challenges of urban sustainability transitions \nwithout the support of regional, national and supranational \ngovernments. Alongside this need for multi-level governance \nacross the traditional structures of government, there is also \na recognition that the governance of transitions requires a \nredrawing of the boundaries between the state and society \n(Ehnert et al., 2018). This does not mean that government \ninstitutions do not continue to play an important role, but \nrather that effective governance of complex sustainability issues \nrelies on collaboration with stakeholders from science, business \nand society (EEA and Eionet, 2016).\n\nEuropean citizens are deeply concerned about climate change \nand the environment and believe that their actions to protect \nthe environment matter (EC, 2017). This suggests that more \nproactive involvement of EU institutions and Member States \nin environmental matters is possible, together with stronger \nengagement and support of citizens and local stakeholders \nfor measures taken by the EU and national governments \n(EEA,\u00a02019a).\n\n1.3 Cities as complex systems\n\nAs Table 1.1 indicates, many systemic social, environmental \nand economic challenges are concentrated in urban areas. \nYet cities can also help provide solutions to these challenges. \nAs well as being economically important and being home to \nalmost three quarters of European citizens, cities are 'hubs \nof creativity, innovation and learning' that are 'crucial for \ntransitions \u2026 with the capacity to effect systemic change at local \nscales and to share ideas through city networks' (EEA, 2019a). \nUrban areas also face particular vulnerabilities that necessitate \ntransformative adaptation (EEA, 2019a, 2020b). Cities and \ncity authorities are well placed to develop and implement \nthe integrated solutions that the transition to a low-carbon, \nresilient, resource-efficient economy requires.\n\nCities can be seen as 'distinct systems that can be transformed' \n(EEA, 2019a), and within cities are nested interconnected \nproduction and consumption sub-systems such as those for \nenergy, food and mobility. Cities are as a result frequently \nconceptualised as complex systems, which are unpredictable \nand dynamic. Urban sub-systems interact in bilateral \nand multilateral positive (i.e. reinforcing) and negative \n\n(i.e.\u00a0conflicting) ways (Rode, 2019). These interactions lead to \na range of outcomes for urban residents, the environment \nand the economy. These include intended outcomes, such as \naccess to employment and services, sufficient and affordable \nfood, or reliable energy supplies. However, there will also be \nnegative impacts and interactions between the systems, for \nexample air and noise pollution from traffic, and damage \nto or loss of habitats and green space from infrastructure \ndevelopment. Indeed, many urban problems arise as a direct \nresult of the disregard, by policymakers and planners, of \nconflicting relationships between urban sub-systems (Rode, \n2019).\n\nCities also depend on their hinterlands and on national and \ninternational connections for food, water, energy and other \nsupplies. People, resources and goods flow in and out of cities, \nand, through the activities happening in cities, waste and \npollution (e.g. to air and water) is dispersed within and beyond \ncity boundaries.\n\nCities and urban authorities in the EU often control significant \nbudgets (Heinelt, 2017) and can set all or some of their own \npolicy and strategy. They have responsibility for local services \nsuch as water, mobility, energy and waste. It is increasingly \nrecognised that 'cities are key players in implementing the \nEU's goals in terms of a low-carbon economy \u2026 and resource \nefficiency. They are crucial in improving waste management, \npublic transport, water management and, through integrated \nurban planning, the efficient use of land' (EEA, 2019a). \nHowever, given the complex nature of urban systems, \ndecision-makers in cities and urban authorities 'require \nstrategies to embrace complexity and analytical devices to \nbetter understand the problems and develop courses of \naction' (Rode, 2019).\n\n1.4 The role of cities in European \nenvironmental policy\n\nThe influence of cities in EU policymaking has been increasingly \nrecognised over the last few decades, including through the \nestablishment of the Committee of the Regions in 1994 and \nthe signing of the Leipzig Charter in 2007 and culminating \nin the EU Urban Agenda, established following the Pact of \nAmsterdam in June 2016. While cities do not have a formal role \nin decision-making at the EU level, municipal administrations \ncan influence decisions, as they are a key source of expertise \nand offer legitimacy to the EU given their proximity to citizens. \nOnce EU legislation is transposed into Member State law, cities \noften have a key role in its implementation, particularly as \nmany individual countries in the EU have granted cities and \nregions constitutional powers of self-governance. Cities also \noften control significant budgets, and municipal administrations \nrepresent an important part of the 'state-at-work' in many EU \nMember States (Heinelt, 2017).\n\f\nWhy is the EEA interested in\u00a0cities? \n\n10 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nIn parallel with this increasing recognition of the role of cities \nin Europe, and not unconnected, has been a trend towards \nstrengthening urban governance. This has been coupled \nwith an expansion of a range of networks, organisations and \ninitiatives across European cities and their metropolitan areas \n(JRC, 2020), such as EuroCities and ICLEI (Local Governments \nfor Sustainability) Europe. There has also been an increasing \ncommitment from European cities on the global stage working \nthrough large networks, such as the United Cities and Local \nGovernments (UCLG), Metropolis, the C40 Cities Climate \nLeadership Group and the Global Covenant of Mayors, and \ngiven an extra momentum and focus by the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and their implementation \u2014\nSDG\u00a011 in particular. For example, many local governments \nin Europe have made a political commitment to climate \nchange adaptation by joining international initiatives, with \nover a quarter of the population in the 38 EEA member \nand collaborating countries living in the local authorities \ncommitted to adaptation under the Covenant of Mayors for \nClimate and Energy (EEA, 2020b). This is empowering cities, \nfacilitating greater cooperation and knowledge exchange, \nand has accelerated the demand for the devolution of fiscal, \npolitical, and administrative powers and responsibilities to \ncities from central governments (JRC, 2020).\n\nTaking the example of adaptation to climate change, \nby following the 2013 EU strategy Member States have \nrecognised the importance of adaptation in the urban context \nand many identify local governments as the implementers \nof adaptation (EEA, 2020b). Local-level adaptation planning \nor climate change risk assessments are mandatory in some \ncountries, and several hundred cities have benefited so far \nfrom EU funding for adaptation-related research, knowledge \nexchange, and the planning and implementation of measures. \nMany cities have organised their own mutual support and \nknowledge sharing through networks at the international, \nnational or regional scale (EEA, 2020b).\n\n1.5 The EEA's stakeholder-led approach to \nunderstanding and assessing urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nRecognising the transversal and complex nature of urban \nsustainability research and practice, in 2017 the EEA launched \na work stream on understanding and assessing urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Figure 1.1 illustrates this work in \nthe context of the timeline of other key initiatives and the EEA's \nstate and outlook reports (SOERs).\n\nThe EEA's urban environmental sustainability work has \nincorporated a broad stakeholder-led process involving both \ninternal and external experts, including:\n\n\u2022 a request for information and sources (2017) as part of the \nwork to build a knowledge base on urban environmental \nsustainability (see Section 2.2);\n\n\u2022 a series of external stakeholder workshops and meetings \nheld in December 2017, November 2018, November 2019 \nand December 2020, each bringing the EEA and external \nstakeholders together to inform and co-create a conceptual \nframework for urban environmental sustainability (see \nChapter 3) and to help develop and implement assessments \nof environmental sustainability (see Chapter 4), including \nanalysis of urban nexuses (see Section 4.2) and analysis of \nthe drivers and barriers (see Section 4.3);\n\n\u2022 an online survey of European cities (2019), and interviews \n(2020) with selected pioneering city authorities, to explore \nand assess the key drivers of and barriers to urban \nsustainability transitions (see Section 4.3); and\n\n\u2022 throughout there have also been specific inputs to \nand consultation and feedback on draft reports and \nassessments from a range of stakeholders, and in particular \nthe European Environment Information and Observation \nNetwork (Eionet), including the European Topic Centres \n(ETCs), which have also acted in their capacity as strategic \nco-creation partners, scientific advisers and networkers.\n\nThis approach, including a thorough internal (EEA) co-creation \nprocess and the series of external stakeholder workshops, has \nensured an excellent degree of participation and helped build \ncredibility for the work.

The European \nenvironment \u2014 state\u00a0and outlook 2020 (SOER 2020) creates a new \nmandate for the EEA to work at the urban level. While\u00a0the\u00a0main \nconclusions are targeted at the broader country/institutional \nlevel, they nonetheless express the relevance of other scales \nof action such as cities. SOER 2020 calls for urgent action \nin several key areas and affirms the need for 'enabling \ntransformative change [that] will require that all areas and \nlevels of government work together and harness the ambition, \ncreativity and power of citizens, businesses and communities' \n(EEA, 2019a).\n\nSOER 2020 builds on SOER 2015, which concluded that \n'Living well within environmental limits will require \n\nfundamental transitions in core societal systems, \nincluding food, energy, mobility, urban, fiscal and finance \nsystems. To achieve such purpose, profound changes in \ndominant practices, policies and thinking are needed.' \nThis will require fundamental transitions in core societal \nsystems, including the urban system, and this will \nnecessitate profound changes in dominant practices, \npolicies and thinking.\n\nIn recent years the EEA has produced a range of outputs \n(e.g.\u00a0reports, tools and online repositories) that provide \nindicators and case studies at the EU city level and at \nthe national/regional level. These cover a range of urban \nenvironmental topics including climate, air and noise \npollution, resource use, energy and transport. A summary \nof key recent EEA activities on urban environmental \nsustainability is presented in Table 2.1.\n\nTable 2.1 Overview of the EEA's activities on urban environmental sustainability\n\nSelected key reports and sources Summary of data/indicators/examples available \n\nUrban adaptation in Europe: How cities \nand towns respond to climate change \n(EEA,\u00a02020b)\n\n\u2022 Provides an up-to-date evidence base on adaptation planning and actions in the \nlocal and urban contexts.\n\n\u2022 Summarises the scientific evidence on climate- and weather-related hazards \nfacing European cities and their impacts.\n\n\u2022 Includes many case studies of urban adaptation in Europe.\n\nHealthy environment, healthy lives: How \nthe environment influences health and \nwell\u2011being in Europe (EEA, 2019c)\n\n\u2022 Provides a knowledge base to support the development of integrated policies \nthat address the environment, health and well-being nexus.\n\n\u2022 While the report does not specifically focus on the urban environment, many \nof the issues and data are highly pertinent to it and it includes case studies \nfrom\u00a0cities.\n\n\u2022 Some issues, such as the accessibility of green space across Europe, focus \nspecifically on the urban environment. \n\nAir quality in Europe: 2019 report \n(EEA,\u00a02019d)\n\n\u2022 Includes indicators on population exposure to main groups of air pollutants \n(PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2) in urban and suburban areas across Europe.\n\f\nBuilding a knowledge base on urban environmental sustainability\n\n14 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nTable 2.1 Overview of the EEA's activities on urban environmental sustainability\n\nSelected key reports and sources Summary of data/indicators/examples available \n\nEurope's urban air quality: Re\u2011assessing \nimplementation challenges in cities \n(EEA,\u00a02018b)\n\n\u2022 Provides data on exposure to air pollution in cities, including from main source \nsectors.

The work \nis therefore not trying to capture the breadth of all the \neconomic, social and environmental dimensions of urban \nsustainability, but instead it concentrates on the EEA's \nenvironmental perspective on urban sustainability. However, \nthe need to break out of separate 'economic', 'social' and \n'environment' silos is reflected in EU policy initiatives such as \nthe Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th\u00a0EAP), EU \nbiodiversity strategy for\u00a02030 (EC,\u00a02020) and the European \nGreen Deal (EC, 2019). The 7th\u00a0EAP, for example, has an \nexplicit focus on improving the environment, in order to \nbenefit health and well-being, and creating a resourceefficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy (EU, \n2013). The European Green Deal emphasises the need for \n'intense coordination to exploit the available synergies across \nall policy areas' to address the complex and interlinked \nsocial, environmental and economic challenges (EC,\u00a02019). \nThe EEA is therefore interested in questions that touch on \nthe breadth of sustainability, but from a clear environmental \nperspective\u00a0\u2014 for example, will air pollution be a more \nserious issue for a larger elderly urban population? And what \nimpact will climate change have on key infrastructure and \nassets upon which the economies of cities depend?\n\n2.2 Existing urban environmental \nsustainability knowledge base\n\nAs part of understanding the availability of data and information \non urban environmental sustainability and where there are key \ngaps, a review of possibly relevant data sources, indicators and \ncase studies was undertaken. This principally focused on those \nsources where data and indicators and examples are managed \nor owned by relevant pan-European agencies (e.g.\u00a0Eurostat, \nEuropean Commission) and updated frequently. Other sources, \nincluding from external European and international organisations \nand initiatives, as well as academic and peer-reviewed research \npapers, were also considered (see Table 2.2).\n\nFrom the review of sources, it is evident that there is an \nabundance of quantitative data on the environmental \nquality, land use, biodiversity and resilience thematic \nareas in an urban context. For example, urban land \nuse is distinguished as a specific topic in several of the \nsources reviewed such as the Copernicus Urban Atlas \nproviding data on green urban areas. Other topics with \nreadily available data/indicators and examples are climate \nchange adaptation, transport and energy. A key source of \n\ncase studies on climate adaptation is the Climate-ADAPT \nplatform\u00a0(1). The sources of information identified from \nthe review also suggest that there is a good representation \nof case studies for some topics such as stakeholder \nengagement and community initiatives.\n\nIn contrast, in some thematic areas, such as urban \nagriculture and food systems, there are more limited sources \nof data or indicators and examples. Considering their broad \nscope, these topic areas do not have a unique source, data \nset or indicator that would provide sufficient information \nfor the purposes of a comprehensive assessment of urban \nsustainability. Therefore, it is likely to be necessary to draw \non a selection of multiple sources of data or indicators and \nexamples to provide the evidence on certain thematic areas. \nAnother common issue among various sources of data and \nindicators is that the scale is incompatible with the required \nurban focus. Across the sources there are indicators and \ndata that fit within a specific thematic area; however, they \nare not necessarily available specifically for urban areas or \nto common boundaries, thus currently limiting their utility in \nthe assessment of urban environmental\u00a0sustainability.\n\nIt is important to note that assessments related to some \ntopics would require both qualitative and quantitative \nevidence. For example, assessing the quality of life aspects \nin urban environments through quantitative indicators \nthat look at physical environment will not provide a \ncomprehensive characterisation of this issue. Improving \nthe quality of the environment by itself does not improve \nthe quality of life of individuals. Furthermore, 'good-quality' \npublic space is not an objective description. It will mean \ndifferent things to different\u00a0people.\n\nThe review also highlights some of the challenges in \nterms of the information likely to be available for urban \nsustainability assessment. These include infrequent updates \nand lack of standardisation of cross-country data for cities, \nresulting in limited comparability, which is acknowledged \nby Eurostat (Eurostat, 2020a).

If we are to \nunderstand what factors may influence the transition towards \nurban environmental sustainability, it is important to improve \nunderstanding of the concept. Hence, a conceptual framework \nfor urban environmental sustainability has been developed.\n\nA conceptual framework attempts to explain a phenomenon. \nIt seeks to map out a theoretical structure of assumptions, \ncomponents, principles, etc., that holds together the \nideas comprising a broad concept. In the case of urban \nenvironmental sustainability, it is important to understand \nwhat factors \u2014 whether they be components or variables \nacting as enablers or barriers, for example \u2014 need to be in \nplace or avoided to facilitate the transition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability.\n\nThe logic behind the development of a conceptual framework \nis that it is required to understand complexity and provide a \n\nframework for consistent assessment and analysis. Breaking \ndown a concept into components also enables analysis to \nconsider interrelationships between individual components \nwhile maintaining perspective on the whole concept, which is \nimportant in helping to understand a complex system.\n\nFor the EEA, a conceptual framework will help provide a clear \nstructure to its thinking and a narrative under which to have a \ncoherent approach to its urban environmental sustainability \nassessments (see Figure 3.1), including in terms of:\n\n\u2022 the key components and outcomes that should define a \nvision of environmental sustainability in an urban context \nin\u00a0Europe; and\n\n\u2022 the components required to support the transition of \nEuropean cities towards a more sustainable future, \nparticularly focusing on urban environmental sustainability.\n\nFigure 3.1 Illustration of the need for a conceptual framework to help understand what influences the \ntransition towards urban environmental sustainability\n\nTransition towards urban \nenvironmental sustainability\n\nWhat enablers need \nto be in place?\n\nWhat barriers need\nto be avoided?\n\nWhat outcomes are \npart of the vision?\n\nWhat components\nare required?\n\nWhat is the in\ufffduence\nof complexity?\n\nWhat contextual\nfactors are in\ufffduential?\n\nWhat are the di\ufffderent\nperspectives?\n\nWhat qualities and\nprocesses contribute?\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nA conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\n18 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nGiven the complexity and interdependence of urban systems, it \nis acknowledged that attempting to categorise distinct elements \nis reductionist and potentially oversimplistic. However, a \nsimple model or framework should help us to understand \nthese complex concepts and will assist the EEA to develop its \nknowledge base and inform its assessments.\n\nThe development of the conceptual framework was informed \nby a knowledge review of EEA and other literature, a review \nof key EU policy frameworks, and feedback from stakeholders \nthroughout. Early in the process of developing the framework, \nfour types of cities were identified: the resilient city, the \ncircular city, the green city and the inclusive city. This model \nwas further developed in 2017 and tested both with internal \n(EEA) stakeholders and with external stakeholders at events \nin Copenhagen in December 2017 and November 2018. A \nmeta-analysis of drivers of sustainability transitions was also \ncompleted to further understand the factors supporting urban \nenvironmental sustainability and to consider the extent to \nwhich benchmarking may be possible.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020 several iterations of the proposed \nconceptual framework were developed in collaboration with \nstakeholders, both internal (EEA) and external. The starting \npoint was the EEA's initial four broad categories of sustainable \ncity, which were complemented with two further categories \n(the healthy city and the low-carbon city). Following the results \nof the knowledge review, the original approach was to upgrade \nthe initial categories by adding further lenses of analysis, \nintroducing the notion of enabling factors and developing \nassessment topics. This 'taxonomy' approach, comprising \ndifferent 'levels' of urban sustainability components served the \npurpose of bringing richness to the relatively simplistic initial \nmodel while keeping track of the essential features of such a \nmodel and aligning it with environment and climate policies.\n\nThe proposed conceptual framework is presented in Section\u00a03.3, \nwhich includes a description of the framework components: \nsix lenses, six enabling factors and 19 building blocks. The \nconceptual framework has provided the focus for the urban \nnexus approach and analysis and the analysis of drivers of urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions (see Chapter 4).\n\n3.2\t Defining\turban\tenvironmental\t\nsustainability\n\nThere is no agreed definition of urban sustainability, or of \nwhat a sustainable city might look like. However, there is \nbroad agreement on what contributes to urban sustainability. \nThe World Urban Forum affirmed in 2002 that the creation \nof sustainable cities required addressing economic, social, \nenvironmental and governance issues in an integrated way \n(UN-Habitat and DFID, 2002). More recently, Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 11 \u2014 make cities inclusive, safe, \nresilient and sustainable \u2014 seeks to maintain cities in a way \nthat continues to create jobs and prosperity without straining \n\nland and resources (UN, 2020). This includes the sustainability \nof the linkages between cities and their rural hinterland as well \nas natural areas, both terrestrial and marine.\n\nReflecting the EEA's mandate to help its member and \ncooperating countries make informed decisions about \nimproving the environment, integrating environmental \nconsiderations into economic policies and moving towards \nsustainability, the focus of this report is on urban sustainability \nfrom an environmental perspective. The EEA's approach to \nurban environmental sustainability acknowledges that social \nand economic dimensions are important, but focuses primarily \non environmental issues in urban areas. These include air and \nwater pollution, noise pollution, green spaces providing space \nfor people and nature, biodiversity loss, resource efficiency, and \nmitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nmanage the impacts of climate change. Such environmental \nissues also underpin and support the social and economic \nhealth of cities, and as noted in Section 1.3 cities can be seen as \ncomplex systems in which all elements of sustainability interact.\n\nFurthermore, the systemic interlinkages between \nenvironmental sustainability and broader sustainability \nare explicitly recognised and considered in the conceptual \nframework (see Section 3.3) and related assessments (see \nChapter 4). This is in line with the EEA's focus on sustainability \ntransitions, which reflect the need for fundamental change in \ncore societal systems (EEA, 2019f).\n\nOverall, urban environmental sustainability is intended to be a \nbroad concept. It is the EEA's preferred term for capturing the \nbreadth of its interests. As a foundation for future cities, it is \na term that includes encouraging revitalisation and transition \nof urban areas and cities to improve liveability, promote \ninnovation and reduce environmental impacts while maximising \neconomic and social co-benefits. Urban environmental \nsustainability is likely to be reflected in the extent to which the \nfollowing characteristics are seen or can be developed in cities \n(Moir et al., 2014; EBRD, 2016; GPSC, World Bank, 2018):\n\n\u2022 a relatively compact and densely populated mixed-use \nurban form that creates efficiency gains;\n\n\u2022 a secure and healthy urban environment where both \npeople and nature can thrive;\n\n\u2022 safe and high-quality public spaces, with good quality, \naffordable, accessible and healthy housing for residents;\n\n\u2022 inclusive access to services and jobs within walking distance \nor reachable by short and convenient public transport \nseamlessly integrated with active transport (walking and \ncycling) infrastructures;\n\n\u2022 clean energy and smart technologies harnessed to \nincrease\u00a0well-being, reduce environmental impact and \nprotect ecosystems;\n\f\nA conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\n19Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\n\u2022 efficient and circular use of resources (water, energy, \nland, materials) and adaptive solutions to energy and \nwater\u00a0demands;\n\n\u2022 environmental, natural and physical assets preserved and \nenhanced for future generations;\n\n\u2022 resilient against and adapted to the growing impacts and \nrisks from climate change and natural hazards;\n\n\u2022 local governance with the capacity to carry out its functions \nwith active participation from citizens.\n\nThus, in addition to the environmental dimension, urban \nenvironmental sustainability also has a 'human-centred' \ndimension, enhancing and changing how people live, interact \nand engage with cities.\n\n3.3 The conceptual framework overview and \ncomponents\n\n3.3.1 Overarching conceptual framework\n\nFigure 3.2 presents the overarching conceptual framework for \nurban environmental sustainability. The framework is based \naround four main components. These are:\n\n\u2022 Lenses \u2014 a range of perspectives on urban environmental \nsustainability that represent priority issues or concerns \nreflecting the EEA's environmental remit and can be used to \nguide and focus assessment and analysis.\n\n\u2022 Context \u2014 the range of current and historical physical, social \nand institutional characteristics that create and shape the \nsetting in which a specific city exists, develops and functions. \nEach city's context will have a considerable influence on the \ntransition to urban environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Enabling factors \u2014 relatively high-level forces that can \nfacilitate (drivers) or hinder (barriers) the transition towards \nurban environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Building blocks \u2014 key qualities that contribute to urban \nenvironmental sustainability. Depending on the context and \nenabling factors, different building blocks will be required to \ntransition towards urban environmental sustainability.\n\nEach of these components is described in more detail in \nthe\u00a0following sections.\n\n3.3.2 Lenses on urban environmental sustainability\n\nThe six lenses represent headline perspectives on \nurban environmental sustainability reflecting the EEA's \nenvironmental remit. They also cover the key elements \n\nof relevant EU environment and climate policies and \nframeworks. These perspectives are not conflicting and \nmay overlap, and together they mutually reinforce the \ntransition towards urban environmental sustainability. The \nlenses provide a high-level frame to guide more nuanced \nassessment and analysis, for example at the level of building \nblocks or collections of building blocks. The six urban \nenvironmental sustainability lenses are presented and \ndescribed in Figure 3.3.\n\nThere is a range of other terms and formations of cities that \nare used in the literature and by different organisations and \ncould represent additional lenses, such as 'smart cities', 'future \ncities', 'liveable cities', 'compact cities' and 'garden city' (Moir \net al., 2014). These terms and frameworks are often relatively \nbroad and can overlap; are sometimes associated with certain \ncontexts, geographies or disciplines; and can have hybrid or \nambiguous meanings. In developing the lenses, the intention \nwas to convey a relatively clear and simple set of perspectives \non urban environmental sustainability that capture the EEA's \npriority interests given its remit (see also Section 3.2). The \nselected lenses are not trying to replace or replicate these \nother terms and framings, which have equal validity and could \nbe used in combination with the lenses. There will also be links \nbetween some of the enabling factors and buildings blocks in \nthe EEA's conceptual framework and these other terms and \nframeworks. Aspects of these terms and frameworks also \nemerge through the analysis of urban nexuses and drivers the \napproach to which is described in Chapter 4.\n\nTaking the example of compact cities, they have long been \nconsidered to have a range of potential benefits, which \ninclude dense development patterns, better accessibility \nof local services and jobs, short intra-urban distances \nand efficient public transport systems, that make positive \ncontributions to the efficiency of infrastructure investment \nand reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide \n(CO2) emissions, as well as contributing to knowledge \ndiffusion and economic growth (OECD, 2020). This concept \nclearly has some overlaps with the characteristics of urban \nenvironmental sustainability described above, but the lenses \naim to provide a more disaggregated set of perspectives to \naid analysis rather than a holistic formation of future cities.\n\nIn relation to COVID-19, there are emerging studies that \ninvestigate the correlation of cases of and deaths from the \nvirus with both the population size and density of functional \nurban areas. But it is important to note in the context of \ncompact cities that it is not density alone that make cities \npotentially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 but the \nstructural economic and social conditions of cities that \nmake them more or less able to implement effective policy \nresponses. For instance, cities marked by inequalities, \ninadequate housing conditions and a high concentration \nof urban poor are potentially more vulnerable than those \nthat are better resourced, less crowded and more equal \n(OECD,\u00a02020).\n\f\nA conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\n20 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nFigure 3.2 Conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\nCU\nLT\n\nURE \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGOVERNANCE  \n\n \n \n\nKNOW\nLEDGE \n\nTECH\nN\n\nOLOGY \n \n\n \n\n \nDATA AND INFORMATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFI\nN\n\nAN\nCE\n\n \n\nEnvironmental \nquality\n\nAdaptive\ncapacity\n\nPublic \nopen space\n\nGreen and blue\ninfrastructure\n\nEcological\nmulti\nfunctionality\n\nSustainable \nurban\n\n agriculture\n\nRenewable\nenergy\n\nLow energy\n consumption\n\nEnergy \nefficiency\n\nEfficient \nmaterial \n\nuse and zero \nwaste\n\nResource \nefficiency\n\nSustainable\nmobility\n\nGreen\neconomy\n\nBuilt \nenvironmental\n\nquality\n\nIntegrated\nplanning\n\nHousing\nplanning\n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \n\njustice\n\nParticipation\nand\n\nempowerment\n\nCollaborative \nand \n\ncommunity-led\ninitiatives\n\nTHE\n(SUSTAINABLE)\n\nCITY\n\nLow-carbon city lens\n\nCircular city lens\n\nHealthy city lens\n\nInclusive city lens\n\nGreen city lens\n\nResilient city lens\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nEnabling factors\n\nLenses\n\nContext (the geography of a \nparticular city as well as its urban \nform, infrastructure, people, \ninstitutions, etc.)\n\nCO2\n\nCONTEXT\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nA conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\n21Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\n3.3.3 Context\n\nContext is defined as the range of current and historical \nphysical (e.g. geographical, environmental), social and \ninstitutional characteristics that create and shape the setting \nin which a specific city exists, develops and functions. These \ncharacteristics influence the ability of a city to transition to \nenvironmental\u00a0sustainability.\n\nThese characteristics may include:\n\n\u2022 geographical location (e.g. coastal, mountainous) and \nnatural assets;\n\n\u2022 climatic conditions;\n\n\u2022 city size and urban form (e.g. level of compactness, ratio \nbetween green and built space, the relationship between \nurban, peri-urban and rural areas);\n\n\u2022 demographics, including level of inequality, gentrification \nand poverty;\n\n\u2022 structure of the economy;\n\n\u2022 existing infrastructure (e.g. public transport network, utilities);\n\n\u2022 institutional arrangements; \n\n\u2022 other unique aspects that form the complex system of\u00a0an \nindividual city.\n\n3.3.4 Enabling factors\n\nEnabling factors are relatively high-level forces that facilitate \nor hinder environmental sustainability. Enabling factors \ncan influence the degree of initiation and continuation of \nsome types of action. Each enabling factor is associated with \nclusters of characteristics that act as drivers or barriers to \nthe transition towards urban environmental sustainability. \nThey are likely to be specific to a particular city based on its \nunique characteristics (e.g. the governance, cultural or other \ncharacteristics of a city). Although the drivers associated with \nan enabling factor are not sufficient by themselves to ensure \nthat sustainability transitions will be initiated, they will support \nthis process, and their associated barriers may hinder, retard \nor constrain such development (Lee and Klassen, 2008). \nSpecific drivers may help initiate and motivate individuals or \norganisations to take action to achieve certain objectives, and \nconversely specific barriers may have a negative influence on \nor constrain taking action.\n\nSix enabling factors have been identified \u2014 culture, \nknowledge, data and information, technology, governance, and \nfinance\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which help frame the transition towards achieving \nurban environmental sustainability. Table 3.1 provides a \ndescription of each enabling factor and lists some of the \nassociated drivers or\u00a0barriers.\n\nFigure 3.3 The urban environmental sustainability lenses\n\nThe low carbon city - City that has achieved or is moving towards achieving low-carbon practices in all its aspects including \n                                                    economy, daily life (e.g. travel), politics and culture.\n\nThe circular city - City in which all products and material streams can be brought back into the cycle after use, \n      and become a resource for new products and services.  \n\nThe healthy city - City with physical and social environments and community resources which enable people to perform \n      all the functions of life and develop to their maximum potential.\n\nThe inclusive city - City in which the processes of development include a wide variety of citizens and activities involve spatial, \n         social and economic inclusion.\n\nThe green city - City models based on approaches to functional and ecological urban development design provide healthy \n  and sustainable environments for both natural systems and communities.\n\nThe resilient city - City in which the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems \n        enable it to survive, adapt, and grow in response to chronic stresses and acute shocks.   \n\nCO2\n\nPERSPECTIVES ON URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nA conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability\n\n22 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nFactor Description Examples of drivers for/barriers to environmental \nsustainability transition in cities\n\nCulture Characteristics, patterns of behaviour and \nunderstanding of/attitude to issues shared by \na particular group of people in urban areas and \nlearned by socialisation\u00a0(a).\n\nAll cities have their own specific cultural and \nhistorical settings.

Such analyses could be top down \nby institutions such as the EEA or bottom up by individual \nmunicipalities or cities. The conceptual framework can be \nused to identify potential analytical tools (e.g. indicators \nand supporting data sets, assessment methodologies, case \nstudies) as part of the analysis. This in turn will provide the \nbasis for the EEA's current and future urban environmental \nsustainability\u00a0assessments.\n\nGiven the complexity and interactions between processes \nand policies within urban systems, the components of the \nconceptual framework are intended to provide a pragmatic \nmeans of structuring analysis, for example by focusing on \nspecific building blocks. Analyses can also be focused using the \nlenses, such that a particular perspective (e.g. low-carbon city \nor healthy city) is selected to provide a logical framing of the \nanalysis and a means of managing the complexity involved.\n\nThe EEA approach to the analysis of urban environmental \nsustainability is based around mixed methods, creating \nnarratives that draw on both qualitative and quantitative \ndata. The EEA is developing two initial approaches to urban \nsustainability assessment, drawing on the conceptual \nframework: urban nexus analysis and analysis of drivers and \nbarriers (learning from the experience of pioneering cities). \nThe\u00a0approach used in each of these analytical models is \ndescribed below in sections 4.2. and 4.3.\n\n4.2 Urban nexus analysis\n\n4.2.1 The nexus concept and urban nexus approach\n\nThe European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 stresses \nthat achieving sustainability transitions requires coherence \nacross policy domains and scales. Policymaking and action are \noften developed in silos, addressing specific sectors or issues, \nwith contrasting objectives (EEA, 2019a). Likewise, research and \nknowledge development are frequently compartmentalised \nalong disciplinary boundaries. This means that misalignment \nand conflicts are inevitable, and it limits shared understanding \nof systemic challenges and responses that reflect fully the \n'barriers, opportunities, trade-offs and co-benefits associated \nwith systemic change' (EEA, 2019a). There is a need for 'policies \nthat embrace the inherent interconnectedness of systems \ncomponents, interactions across systems, and links between \neconomic, social and environmental goals' (EEA, 2019a).\n\nThis is certainly the case in cities and metropolitan areas and \ntheir peripheries, where the complexity of interactions between \nsocio-economic and environmental factors present significant \nchallenges for improving quality of life while minimising \nenvironmental pressures and resource depletion. However, \nurban areas also provide opportunities for positive systemic \nchange. What is needed is better coordination and prioritisation \nof policymaking and action across sectors. Prioritisation is \nparticularly important here, as 'total integration' of everything \nwith everything as part of political processes is impossible. \nRecognising and prioritising critical interrelationships that have \nnot been addressed appropriately is a key first step for better \nintegrated policymaking (Rode, 2018). By considering priority \n\n\u00a9 Enik\u0151 Benedek, My City/EEA\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n28 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\ninterlinkages between systems and policy areas, environmental, \nsocial and economic trade-offs and co-benefits\u00a0(2) can be \nidentified (Rode, 2018; EEA, 2019a).\n\nOne approach to thinking about the interactions between \nsystems and policies is by using a nexus approach. Box 4.1 \nprovides more information on the nexus concept, nexus \napproach and analysis. A nexus is defined as the interlinkages \nand interrelationships between two or more systems (e.g.\u00a0food \nand energy) or policy areas. Nexus analysis refers to the \nidentification and analysis of the interactions, interrelations \nand interdependencies among sectors and policies or other \ninterventions. The nexus approach refers to proactive and \nintegrated policy engagement with such interrelated sectors \nresulting in a new approach to policymaking and action. \nIn an urban context this means considering together two \nor more urban policy areas in order to address a specific \nurban environmental sustainability problem or to advance a \npolicy objective. By identifying priority synergies, co-benefits \nand trade-offs, opportunities can be identified for better \ncoordinated and integrated policymaking and action.\n\nConsidering urban issues in this way is intended to improve \nunderstanding of interactions and enable more coherent and \neffective policy and other interventions that can identify and \nminimise trade-offs and 'reduce environmental pressures \u2026\nrealising potential co-benefits for human health and well-\u00a0being' \n(EEA, 2019a). A nexus approach can help decision-makers \nchoose the most appropriate policy measures or other actions \nto help identify cost-effective interventions and minimise \nhidden or unanticipated costs. Cost-effectiveness is defined \n(EC, 2014) as either, for a given outcome (e.g. a percentage \nreduction in air pollution), minimising the net-present value of \ncosts or, for a given cost, maximising the relevant outcome(s). \nIn the context of urban environmental sustainability, \ncost-effectiveness also considers the co-benefits of an \nintervention (e.g. the health benefits of meeting a primary \nobjective of reduced air pollution).\n\nIn summary, the potential benefits of conducting nexus analysis \nfor urban environmental sustainability are to:\n\n\u2022 help manage the complexity of urban systems by identifying \ncritical interrelationships, co-dependencies and trade-offs \nbetween selected aspects of urban environmental \nsustainability and/or desired policies and other interventions;\n\n\u2022 identify and assess specific counteracting and reinforcing \npolicies and other interventions and their outcomes;\n\n\u2022 improve understanding of how to achieve multiple \noutcomes and objectives together and take advantage of \nco-benefits;\n\n\u2022 identify opportunities for improved policy integration \nand efficacy by jointly considering multiple objectives and \ndesired outcomes; \n\n\u2022 through the above, help to identify cost-effective urban \nsustainability policy and action.\n\nInteractions and dependencies with policy at \ndifferent\u00a0scales\n\nEU cities often have a degree of autonomy in their governance \nand budgetary arrangements. The analysis of urban \nsustainability nexuses focuses in particular on policymaking and \naction that cities can directly influence and control. The extent \nof this control will vary between cities and metropolitan areas, \ndepending on factors such as their size and the governance \narrangements in different countries; however, the analysis \naims to draw out lessons that can have broad relevance. The \nintention is to explore how policies and actions can be better \ncoordinated and prioritised by city authorities (and within cities) \nto help achieve urban sustainability outcomes.\n\nAlthough cities can be seen as representing complex systems \nin themselves (at the level of the city or functional urban area), \nthey also have interrelationships and interdependencies \nacross different scales. Figure 4.1 illustrates policy integration \noperating at different scales. In the EU, high-level policy, targets \nand visions are set at the EU level, and Member States have \ntheir own urban policy and regulatory frameworks, including \nthose implementing EU directives. Some countries have \ngovernance at a regional scale, and below this sits city- and \nsub-city-level governance. As illustrated in Figure 4.1, policy \nintegration can therefore be viewed:\n\n\u2022 vertically \u2014 policy areas operating across different scales or \nlevels (e.g. EU, national, city); and\n\n\u2022 horizontally \u2014 different policies or actions implemented \nand interacting with each other at a particular scale \nor\u00a0level.\n\nThe nexus analysis considers both of these types of \nintegration. Each nexus recognises the importance of EU and \nnational policy frameworks and targets, while the analysis \nfocuses on the identification and assessment of horizontal \n\n(2) A co-benefit is where the delivery of one policy area or intervention can help achieve outcomes in another policy area. For example, an \nintervention to encourage active travel (walking and cycling) could have a main objective of improving public health but might have co-benefits \nin terms of reducing congestion and air and noise pollution, thus improving quality of life.\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n29Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nBox 4.1 The nexus concept and its use in an urban context\n\nThe term 'nexus' by definition refers to the interlinkages or connections between two or more elements. A 'nexus \napproach' implies considering explicitly these connections or interlinkages between resources or sectors and the \nimplications of these in, for example, the context of a strategic or policy goal (Magic Nexus, 2018). Hoff (2011) puts the \nnexus approach in the context of system efficiency over sector productivity: 'The nexus focus is on system efficiency, rather \nthan on the productivity of isolated sectors.' The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  considers the \nnexus as a 'conceptual approach to better understand and systematically analyse the interactions between the natural \nenvironment and human activities, and to work towards a more coordinated management and use of natural resources \nacross sectors and scales' (FAO, 2014).\n\nThe nexus approach therefore explicitly recognises synergies and trade-offs as necessary for the development of response \noptions. The approach helps ensure the sustainability of the environment and people's livelihoods, facilitating more \nintegrated and cost-effective policymaking, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThe European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 introduces the concept of the 'resource nexus'. This recognises that \n'links between \u2026 systems arise because of their shared reliance on natural systems, both as a source of resources and \nas a sink for wastes and emissions'. This shared reliance means that 'addressing problems in one area may simply shift \nthe burden to other systems'. A resource nexus approach can also help highlight the interdependence of production \nand consumption systems, and their cumulative impacts (e.g. on ecosystems). Achieving the transition to a low-carbon, \nresource-efficient economy 'will require that the interlinkages across systems are considered and the trade-offs and \nco-benefits identified' (EEA, 2019a).\n\nThe focus of existing definitions of the nexus approach are predominantly on resource efficiency and the management of \nscarcity. However, in an urban context a different focus may be appropriate. UNESCAP (2016) discusses the urban nexus as \nfocusing on the interlinkages among various elements and their 'conversion pathways' \u2014 extraction, supply, distribution, \nend use and disposal \u2014 in consumption and production chains of socio-economic sectors. Furthermore, UNESCAP (2016) \nsuggests that a city serves as a nexus, or focal point, that connects and is shaped by economic, technological and social \nforces. UNESCAP (2016) and Lehman (2018) propose an 'intra-urban nexus' and a 'nested urban nexus', the former \nfocusing 'solely on what is urban in the nexus framing' including urban metabolism, infrastructure and human security, \nwhile the latter recognises that nexus dynamics need to be understood in the context of driving and constraining forces at \nboth lower and higher scales, meaning that nexus analysis at a city level will need to consider developments at other scales, \ne.g.\u00a0global, regional or national policy developments, and ecosystems at sub-national and regional levels.\n\nLocal Governments for Sustainability and GIZ defined the use of urban nexus analysis as an 'approach that guides \nstakeholders to identify and pursue possible synergies between sectors, jurisdictions, and technical domains, so as to \nincrease institutional performance, optimise resource management, and service quality' (ICLEI and GIZ, 2014). Rode (2018) \ndiscusses urban nexus as helping to facilitate a move away from the 'functionally segregated city and its simplistic view \nof the relationship between urban life and city design' towards an approach that can 'better address the complexities, \ninterrelationships and co-dependencies \u2026 characteristic of city systems'. Rode (2018) in particular focuses on what is seen \nas 'the critical nexus' of urban form and transport, which provides a good illustration of the nexus approach in practice, as \n'both elements need to be dealt with jointly to provide accessibility to people, goods and ideas in cities'.\n\npolicy interactions. The aim is to help move towards more \nintegrated policymaking and interventions in cities, and in \nthis way to support the transition to urban environmental \nsustainability. In Figure 4.1 this is illustrated by the red \ntriangle, highlighting as an example the nexus between \n\nthe transport, housing and energy policy areas, which \noperate at the city level (horizontal integration) but are \ninfluenced by and need to be integrated with higher-level \npolicy and in turn will influence lower spheres (vertical \nintegration).\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n30 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\n4.2.2 Methodological approach to the analysis of \nurban nexuses\n\nDrawing on the conceptual framework (see Chapter 3), a \nliterature review and stakeholder input, eight priority urban \nsustainability nexuses were identified and selected. Table 4.1 \npresents an overview of these nexuses. The eight nexuses \nwere selected to cover a range of key urban sustainability \nobjectives and to reflect the main topics addressed by EU \nenvironmental and climate policies. They also highlight \nsome of the most critical interrelationships between sectors, \nwhich are currently not considered appropriately as part of \npolicymaking and action. They are not, however, intended \nto be comprehensive, as a great many other sustainability \nobjectives and critical interrelationships exist, and in meeting \nthese objectives a very large number of critical policy \ninteractions or nexuses could be identified.\n\nThe overall aim of the urban nexus analysis is to explore critical \ninterlinkages and interrelationships between two or more policy \nareas that need to be considered together in order to advance \nan urban sustainability objective. The selected urban nexuses \nare intended to be examples of how this analysis approach \ncould be used in practice to identify existing challenges to \nachieving urban sustainability objectives and opportunities to \nmove towards better coordinated and integrated policymaking \nand action.\n\nEach nexus is framed around meeting a high-level urban \nsustainability objective (e.g. climate resilience, food security) that \nis systemic in nature and requires coordinated policymaking \n\nFigure 4.1 Vertical and horizontal policy integration\n\nand action. Meeting these nexus objectives could require \ninterventions in a large number of policy areas. However, for the \nnexus analysis in each case, three interlinked policy areas were \nselected to help identify examples of key interactions, challenges \nand opportunities for prioritisation and coordination of policy \nand interventions. Different or additional policy areas could \nbe selected to broaden the analysis or to focus on other policy \npriorities. However, the selection for this analysis is intended to \nrepresent some of the key areas in which coordinated policy is \nrequired. Although different cities may use different terminology \nand have divergent levels of authority or autonomy, the selected \npolicy areas are intended to be representative of strategy, policy \nand other interventions commonly seen in cities. For example, in \nareas such as housing, transport, waste management or spatial \nplanning, specific policies, standards and budgets are often set at \na municipal or\u00a0city level.\n\nThe assessment draws on the conceptual framework by \nconsidering actions in the context of the 'building blocks' of \nurban sustainability that are relevant to the key policy areas \nin each nexus. Each nexus analysis also explores one example \nof a challenge and the actions to address it in more detail. By \nfocusing the analysis in this way, the intention is to facilitate a \nmore detailed assessment than would be possible if a larger \nnumber of challenges and actions were considered. Of course, \neach nexus has many potential challenges and associated \nactions and these will differ from city to city.\n\nThe nexus analysis is based on an assessment of what \nchallenges cities typically face in meeting urban sustainability \nobjectives, which critical interrelationships are currently \n\nEU level\n\nNational level\n\nRegional level\n\nCity level\n\nHORIZONTAL POLICY INTEGRATION\n\nVE\nRT\n\nIC\nA\n\nL \nPO\n\nLI\nCY\n\n IN\nTE\n\nG\nRA\n\nTI\nO\n\nN\n\nTransport policy\n\nHousing policy\n\nEnergy policy\n\nNatural environment policy\n\nSpatial planning policy\n\nExample nexus\n\nSource: EEA.\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n31Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\n'under-serviced' and how action can be better coordinated \nand/or prioritised across the selected policy areas. In doing so, \nthe analysis can identify co-benefits and trade-offs and help to \nimprove the cost-effectiveness of interventions.\n\nAlthough no hierarchy of nexuses is intended, some do \nrepresent higher-level or more overarching sustainability \nobjectives, while others are more specific. For example, \nmeeting the high-level nexus objective of 'climate resilience' \nrelates to other nexus objectives, in particular 'quality of \nlife', 'urban accessibility', 'environment and health' and 'food \nsecurity'. These relationships are in themselves complex and \nbi-directional. For example, improving 'urban accessibility' or \n'environment and health' through the creation, enhancement \n\nor change in use of green infrastructure can also enhance a \ncity's resilience to climate change ('climate resilience' nexus). \nNexuses that primarily relate to 'environment and society' are \ngrouped together in Table 4.1.\n\nLikewise, the objective of 'closing the loop' in a city implies \nmoving to a more circular urban economy, in which products, \nmaterials, built assets and land are kept in use while maintaining \ntheir value, and waste generation is minimised. Closing the \nloop represents a high-level nexus, and achieving other nexus \nobjectives, in particular 'sustainable buildings' and 'clean energy', \nwill contribute to meeting the higher-level objective of a circular \nurban economy and vice versa. Nexuses that primarily relate to \n'resources and energy' are grouped together in Table 4.1.\n\nTable 4.1 Overview of the eight example nexuses\n\nUrban sustainability objective \n\u2014\u00a0the 'nexus objective'\n\nKey interlinked policy areas that need to be \nconsidered to achieve the nexus objective\n\nExample challenges and the \nactions to address them \n\nEnvironment and society nexuses\n\nClimate resilience \u2022 Spatial planning\n\n\u2022 Green infrastructure\n\n\u2022 Built environment\n\nManaging urban flood risk by using \nnature-based solutions \n\nQuality of life \u2022 Urban design\n\n\u2022 Spatial planning\n\n\u2022 Nature and biodiversity\n\nIncreasing access to green space \nthrough integrated land use planning\n\nUrban accessibility \u2022 Spatial planning\n\n\u2022 Transport\n\n\u2022 Housing\n\nIncreasing urban density through \ntransit-oriented development \n\nEnvironment and health \u2022 Environment\n\n\u2022 Green infrastructure\n\n\u2022 Transport\n\nImproving air quality by creating \ncar-free cities\n\nFood security \u2022 Urban food\n\n\u2022 Spatial planning\n\n\u2022 Waste management\n\nPromoting urban agriculture through \nsmall-scale innovation projects\n\nResources and energy nexuses\n\nClosing the loop \u2022 Resources and materials\n\n\u2022 Waste management\n\n\u2022 Green economy\n\nReducing waste, encouraging reuse \nand boosting local economies \nthrough 'urban resource centres'\n\nClean energy \u2022 Built environment\n\n\u2022 Spatial planning\n\n\u2022 Energy\n\nDecentralising energy production by \nusing clean energy sources\n\nSustainable buildings \u2022 Resources and materials\n\n\u2022 Built environment\n\n\u2022 Urban design\n\nReducing resource consumption in \nbuilding construction and use by \nadopting innovative design, materials \nand systems\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n32 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nFigure 4.2 Template nexus figure\n\nPolicy area 1\n(e.g. spatial planning)\n\nPolicy area 2\n(e.g. housing)\n\nPolicy area 3\n(e.g. transport)\n\nExample challenge and action: \nDetails of the example challenge \nand action included in the nexus\n\nKey policy areas requiring better \ncoordination and integration to \nachieve urban accessibility\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nPolic\ny i\n\nntera\ncti\n\non\nSelection of the key \n\nbuilding blocks \nsupporting urban\n\nPolicy interaction\n\nA template was used to develop each example nexus analysis, \nbased on which each nexus analysis includes:\n\n\u2022 an introductory section setting out why the nexus \nobjective is important for urban sustainability \nand summarising key relevant EU and international \npolicy\u00a0frameworks;\n\n\u2022 a nexus figure that presents visually the interlinked \nselected policy areas that the nexus is based around, as \nwell as the key building blocks relevant to meeting the \nnexus objective (see Figure 4.2, a template nexus\u00a0figure);\n\n\u2022 an overview of the main challenges and actions for cities \nin meeting the nexus objective (including policy and a range \nof other interventions);\n\n\u2022 identification of potentially relevant indicators for \nthe\u00a0nexus;\n\n\u2022 an assessment of one selected example interrelated \narea of policy and action, including case studies from \nEuropean\u00a0cities;\n\n\u2022 a summary of the lessons learned in achieving the nexus \nobjective; and,\n\n\u2022 a list of sources of additional information and existing \nnetworks relevant to the nexus.\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n33Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\n4.3 Drivers and barriers analysis \u2014 learning \nfrom the experience of pioneering cities\n\nThis analysis explores some of the key factors that are driving \nor hindering environmental sustainability transitions in \nselected European cities, in the hope that their experiences can \nprovide useful lessons for other urban areas. These results are \npresented in the EEA report Urban Sustainability in Europe: What \nis driving cities' environmental change? (EEA, 2020c). Given the \nEEA's remit and interests, the focus of this research is on urban \nenvironmental sustainability transitions. Where the term \n'sustainability transitions' is used in this report the principal \nfocus is on the environmental dimension of sustainability \ntransitions within an urban context.\n\n4.3.1 Methodological approach to the analysis of \ndrivers and barriers\n\nThe analysis was based on a mixed methods approach that \ncombined a literature review, a survey of European cities \nand semi-structured interviews with seven case study cities \nto deepen and contextualise the survey results. The mixed \nmethods approach was designed to provide a well-rounded \npicture of the different factors that are driving environmental \nsustainability in European cities today.\n\nThe survey was conducted with a selection of 'frontrunner' \nor pioneering cities that have either won or been selected as \nfinalists in the European Green Capital Awards (EGCA) or the \nEuropean Green Leaf Awards (EGLA). It was structured around \na series of potential drivers and barriers \u2014 actions that are \n'supporting or inhibiting' transitions to urban environmental \nsustainability. These were in turn grouped under 'context' \n(i.e.\u00a0distinct context of every city) and the set of six enabling \n\nfactors including governance, culture, finance, knowledge, \ndata and information, and technology, as defined within the \nconceptual framework (see Chapter 3). An initial set of drivers \nrelated to each enabling factor was proposed and then tested \nand refined through discussion and feedback from the EEA and \nexternal stakeholders. The initial list was then supplemented \nthrough a review of the academic and grey literature to identify \nexamples of the identification and/or assessment of drivers of \nand barriers to urban sustainability transition around the world.\n\nA total of 26 out of the 40 eligible cities (65\u00a0%) responded to the \nsurvey. The geographical spread of the cities that responded \nbroadly mirrored the distribution of all 40 winners and finalists \nof the EGCA and EGLA. Cities in eastern Europe were the least \nrepresented, followed by those in southern Europe. Most of \nthe city representatives who completed the survey worked in \nenvironment and climate change departments.\n\nAfter completing the survey, representatives of seven of these \ncities (Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat, Gabrovo, Leuven, Lisbon, Mikkeli, \nStockholm and Tallinn) were interviewed to achieve a more \nnuanced understanding of what drives urban environmental \nsustainability transitions in some European cities. Figure 4.3 \nshows all of the eligible cities, including those that responded to \nthe survey and those for which an interview was carried out.\n\nThis is a relatively small-scale pilot study to test the approach, \nand the results should therefore not be seen as capturing \nthe full spectrum of drivers and barriers experienced by the \ncase study cities. Given the relatively limited scope of this \nstudy, these findings should be seen as an entry point to a \nwider conversation about the drivers of and barriers to urban \nsustainability transitions rather than a definitive overview of \nthe multitude of complex and interrelated factors that shape \nsustainability outcomes in European cities.\n\f\nApplying the conceptual framework in assessments of urban environmental sustainability\n\n34 Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nFigure 4.3 European Green Capital and European Green Leaf Award winners and finalists and \nsurvey\u00a0respondents\n\nReference data: \u00a9ESRI\n\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n\nBarcelona\n\nMollet del Vall\u00e8s\n\nCornell\u00e0 de LlobregatLisbon\n\nTorres Vedras\n\nGalway\n\nLimerick\n\nBristol\n\nNantes\n\nGlasgow\n\nJoensuu\n\nMikkeli\n\nLappeenrantaLahti\n\nUme\u00e5\n\nMalm\u00f6\n\nV\u00e4xj\u00f6\n\nCopenhagen\n\nFrankfurt\n\nLudwigsburg\n\nNuremberg\n\nFreiburg\n\nHamburg\n\nBrussels\nGhent\n\nMechelen\nLeuven\n\nM\u00fcnster\n\nEssen\n\nNijmegen\nAmsterdam\n\nHorst aan de Maas\ns\u2019-Hertogenbosch\n\nOslo\n\nGabrovo\n\nTallinn\nStockholm\n\nReykjavik\n\nLjubljana\n\nEuropean Green Capital and \nEuropean Green Leaf Award \nwinners and finalists and \nsurvey respondents\n\nEuropean Green Capital Award \n\nResponded to survey\n\nNo response to survey\n\nInterviewed\n\nEuropean Green Leaf Award \n\nResponded to survey\n\nNo response to survey\n\nInterviewed\n\nAzores Is.\n\nMadeira Is.\n\nCanary Is.\n\f\n35Urban sustainability in Europe \u2014 A stakeholder-led process\n\nReferences\n\nBerrini, M. and Bono, L., 2008, Urban Ecosystem Europe \n(UEE).

Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it!\nPage Last modified 29 Jul 2021\n19 min read\nThis glossary provides definitions of the key terms and concepts used in the EEA\u2019s recent work on urban environmental sustainability, including in the following reports and other outputs:\nDefinitions of key general terms and concepts are provided, followed by definitions of specific terms used as part of the EEA\u2019s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability.\nBarriers (to urban environmental sustainability transitions)\nDifficulties that may be preventing some cities from reaching their sustainability potential or from overcoming long-standing economic, institutional and cultural challenges leading to suboptimal environmental outcomes and preventing more radical change from taking place.(Based on EEA, 2020.)\nBuilding blocks\nKey qualities that contribute to urban environmental sustainability. Depending on the context and enabling factors, different building blocks will be the inputs required to transition towards urban environmental sustainability.\nOne of the four main components of the EEA\u2019s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks).(Based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.)\nCircular economy\nA model of production and consumption that aims to maintain the value of products, materials and resources for as long as possible by returning them to the product cycle at the end of their use while minimising the generation of waste. (Based on European Parliament, 2018.)\nCity\nA large and densely populated urban settlement. A city is defined in relation to a political level (administrative boundary) and a densely populated \u2018urban centre\u2019 (population > 50 000). (Based on EC, 2012 and EC, 2016a)\nClosing the loop\nA circular model of resource management in which products, materials, built assets and land are kept in use while maintaining their value. It also means minimising waste generation. (Based on EC, 2015.)\nCo-benefits\nThe additional benefits above and beyond the direct benefits intended from the main action or measures to improve urban environmental sustainability. Sometimes referred to as \u2018multiple benefits\u2019 or \u2018synergies\u2019. (Based on EEA, 2019.)\nCompact city\nOne of a range of terms describing formations of cities that are used in the literature and by different organisations. Compact cities have a range of potential benefits, including dense development patterns, better accessibility to local services and jobs, short intra-urban distances and public transport systems that make positive contributions to the efficiency of infrastructure investments, reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, knowledge diffusion and economic growth.\nThis concept aims to provide disaggregated perspectives to aid analysis rather than a holistic model for future cities (Based on OECD, 2020a.)\nConceptual framework (for urban environmental sustainability)\nA way of breaking down the complex concept of urban environmental sustainability into its key components and interrelationships to help provide the EEA with a clear structure for its thinking, including in terms of:\nContext\nThe range of current and historical physical, social and institutional characteristics that create and shape the setting in which a specific city exists, develops and functions. Each city\u2019s context has a considerable influence on its transition to urban environmental sustainability.\nOne of the four main components of the EEA\u2019s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks).(Based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.)\nDrivers (of urban environmental sustainability transitions)\nFactors that encourage cities to transition to urban environmental sustainability and facilitate some cities to reach their sustainability potential. Factors that lead to positive environmental outcomes and support more radical change. (Based on EEA, 2020.)\nEnabling factors\nRelatively high-level forces that, based on their level of availability, facilitate (drivers) or hinder (barriers) the transition towards urban environmental sustainability.\nOne of the four main components of the EEA\u2019s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks).(Based on Lee and Klassen, 2008.)\nFunctional urban area\nConsists of a city and its commuting zone. Functional urban areas therefore consist of a densely inhabited city and a less densely populated commuting zone whose labour market is highly integrated with the city. (Based on Dijkstra et al., 2019.)\nGreen infrastructure\nA strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services (as defined by the European Commission\u2019s communication on green infrastructure \u2014 EC, 2013). Green infrastructure is present in both rural and urban settings. In urban areas, many different features may be part of green infrastructure (e.g. parks, gardens, grassy verges, green walls or green roofs) in so far as they are part of an interconnected network and are delivering multiple ecosystem services. These green urban elements (or blue if aquatic ecosystems are concerned) may be found within the city and in its peri-urban area. (Based on EC, 2013; EEA, 2017.)\nGreen recovery\nThe outcome of the economic stimulus packages and recovery plans that governments have put in place to bring about a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that is both green and inclusive. This will, for example, create opportunities for income, jobs and growth, and at the same time accelerate action on medium- and long-term environmental goals, both national and global. (Based on OECD, 2020b.)\nLenses\nA range of perspectives on urban environmental sustainability that represent priority issues/concerns reflecting the EEA\u2019s environmental remit and that can be used to guide/focus assessment and analysis.\nOne of the four main components of the EEA\u2019s conceptual framework for urban environmental sustainability (Lenses, Context, Enabling factors and Building blocks).(Based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.)\nNew urbanism\nAn urban reform movement that gained prominence in the 1990s and seeks to promote urban qualities that reformers have been seeking for over a century: vital, beautiful, just, environmentally benign human settlements. (Based on Talen, 2005.)\nNexus/nexus analysis/nexus approach\nNexus\u2014 the interlinkages and interrelationships between two or more systems (e.g. food and energy) or policy areas relevant to urban environmental sustainability.\nNexus analysis\u2014 the identification and analysis of the interactions, interrelationships and interdependencies among sectors and policies or other interventions.\nNexus approach\u2014 the consideration of two or more urban policy areas in order to address a specific urban environmental sustainability problem or to advance a policy objective. By identifying priority synergies, co-benefits and trade-offs, opportunities can be identified for better coordinated and integrated policymaking and action.(Based on; Hoff, 2011; FAO, 2014; ICLEI and GIZ, 2014; UNESCAP, 2016; Lehman, 2018; Magic Nexus, 2018; Rode, 2018; EEA, 2019.)\nQuality of life\nThe achievement of a fulfilled human life in cities. It can be highly subjective and dependent on people\u2019s individual circumstances and comprises both material (e.g. food, water and energy security) and non-material (e.g. equity, freedom of choice, enjoyment of natural beauty) dimensions. (Based on IBPES, 2019.)\nResilience\nThe capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems to reduce their exposure to, prepare for, cope with, recover better from, adapt to and transform, as necessary, in response to the impacts of climate change. (Based on Resilient Cities Network, 2021.)\nSustainable buildings\nBuildings that have high levels of energy and resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts across their life cycle. Their users enjoy better health and well-being and productivity gains. In turn this translates into cost savings (Based on EC, 2016.)\nSustainable urban growth\nThe way in which cities and national governments can foster more growth that protects environmental quality and creates thriving, low-carbon and climate\u2011resilient communities that promote economic vitality, health, well-being and social inclusion.(Based on EEA, 2020.)\nSystemic change\nSustainable, large-scale changes in complex adaptive systems (e.g. cities) and their underlying structures and supporting mechanisms (e.g. policies, routines, relationships, resources, power structures and values).(Based on Wolfram and Frantzeskaki, 2016.)\nTrade-offs\nAn antonym of co-benefits. Disbenefits that arise that have to be weighed up against the direct benefits intended from the main action or measures to improve urban environmental sustainability. (Based on EEA, 2019.)\nTransitions (towards urban environmental sustainability)\nThe fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent environmental and societal challenges are addressed. (Based on EEA and Eionet, 2016; Ehnert et al., 2018; EEA, 2019.)\nUrban accessibility\nThe ease with which people can reach goods, services and activities and connect with one another. In urban areas, accessibility is considered high when households can reach a wide variety of destinations in a short time and at a low cost per unit of travel.(Based on Litman 2007; Duranton and Guerra, 2016 ; Rode et al., 2019; EEA, 2021c.)\nUrban/urban areas\nAreas, including cities but also smaller urban settlements and suburban areas, developed for residential, industrial or recreational purposes. (Based on GEMET, 2021a.)\nUrban environmental sustainability\nUrban sustainability from an environmental perspective achieved by focusing on environmental issues in urban areas, such as air and water pollution, green spaces providing space for people and nature, biodiversity loss, resource efficiency, and mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and manage the impacts of climate change. (Based on Moir et al., 2014; EBRD, 2016; IBRD and World Bank, 2018.)\nUrban form\nA city\u2019s physical characteristics as determined by physical elements, morphology, buildings, open spaces, expectant zones and the transport infrastructure.(Based on Rode and Floater, 2014.)\n(Sustainable) Urban mobility\nAllowing people and goods to move freely and safely in towns and cities while respecting the environment, which is crucial both for quality of life and for the health of the economy. It involves tackling challenges such as traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, air and noise pollution, health issues, safety risks and security threats.(Based on EC, 2007.)\nUrban planning\nUrban, city or town planning is the planning discipline dealing with the physical, social, economic and environmental development of metropolitan regions, municipalities and neighbourhoods. The expression \u2018urban planning\u2019 covers developing land use and building plans as well as local building and environmental regulations. (Based on Council of Europe Publishing, 2007.)\nUrban retrofitting\nIncorporating energy- and resource-efficient technologies and approaches into buildings that also bring co-benefits, such as reducing energy costs and creating healthier buildings for residents. (Based on BPIE, 2017.)\nUrban sprawl\nThe physical pattern of the low-density expansion of large urban areas into the surrounding agricultural areas under certain market conditions. Sprawl lies in advance of the principal lines of urban growth and implies little planning control of land subdivision. Development is patchy, scattered and strung out, with a tendency to discontinuity because it leap-frogs over some areas, leaving agricultural enclaves.(Based on GEMET, 2021b.)\nUrban sustainability\nAn adaptive process of addressing economic (e.g. economic equity), social (e.g. resilience to climate change impacts), environmental (e.g. reduced air pollution) and governance (e.g. ensuring citizens\u2019 active participation in carrying out urban functions) issues in an integrated way within and beyond urban areas. (Based on UN-Habitat and DFID, 2002; IBRD and World Bank, 2018.)\nUrban systems\nMultiscale, interdependent, social, natural and engineered systems that affect human and planetary well-being across spatial (local to global) and temporal scales. (Based on Advisory Committee for Environmental Research and Education, 2018.)\nUrbanisation\nUrbanisation is a long-term process characterised by both an increasing share of the population living in towns and cities and the growth of urban areas. (Based on Council of Europe Publishing, 2007.)\nCircular city\nCity in which all product and material streams can be brought back into the cycle after use and become resources for new products and services.(Based on Cramer, 2014.)\nGreen city\nCity model based on approaches to functional and ecological urban development design that provides healthy and sustainable environments for both natural systems and communities.(Based on McHarg, 1995.)\nHealthy city\nCity with physical and social environments and community resources that enable people to perform all the functions of life and develop to their maximum potential.(Based on WHO,1998.)\nInclusive city\nCity in which the processes of development include a wide variety of citizens and activities and involve spatial, social and economic inclusion.(Based on World Bank, 2021.)\nLow-carbon city\nCity that has achieved or is moving towards achieving low-carbon practices in all aspects, including its economy, daily life (e.g. travel), politics and culture.(Based on C40 Cities, 2015.)\nResilient city\nCity in which the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems is enabled to survive, adapt and grow in response to chronic stresses and acute shocks.(Based on Resilient Cities Network, 2021.)\nCulture\nCharacteristics, patterns of behaviour and understanding of/attitude to issues shared by a group of people in urban areas and learned by socialisation. All cities have their own specific cultural and historical settings. Actions to achieve urban environmental sustainability need to recognise, adapt to or draw on culture to improve the design and implementation of new policy measures. (Based on Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, 2019.)\nData and information\nData are raw, unorganised facts in various forms on relevant issues, whereas information is data processed, organised and/or structured so as to make it useful for forming knowledge on a subject, issue, event or process relevant to achieving the urban environmental sustainability transition.\nAccessible, relevant, compatible clearly presented and easy to understand data and information are central for identifying and promoting sustainable urban solutions, and for measuring and monitoring progress towards the urban environmental sustainability transition. (Drawn from Glasgow Caledonian University, 2021.)\nFinance\nManagement of public/government money and the process of acquiring funds through traditional (e.g. taxes, public-private partnerships) and innovative (e.g. micro-contributions/crowd-funding, land value capture) financial mechanisms to support green investments and the transition to urban environmental sustainability. Note that financing typically refers to how the upfront costs of building infrastructure, etc., are met, while funding refers to how it is paid for it over its life cycle.\nAccess to sufficient, sustainable finance from various sources is necessary to develop, deliver and maintain sustainable and high-quality urban infrastructure and services and to support other programmes or actions for urban environmental sustainability transitions. (Drawn from Institute for Government, 2018.)\nGovernance\nThe interaction between the formal institutions and those in civil society. Governance refers to a process whereby actors in society wield power, authority and influence and enact policies and decisions concerning public life and social upliftment.\nPublic engagement, soft governance, transparency, accountability and integrated decision-making processes involving all relevant sectors, stakeholders (e.g. civil society platforms) and levels of government is crucial to support urban sustainability transitions. (Drawn from Global Development Research Center, 2021.)\nKnowledge\nKey insights into urban environmental sustainability processes and their management and options for action held by individuals within a group or among groups. Knowledge supported by the education system, research, innovation, networks and training is essential to identify appropriate solutions to urban environmental sustainability issues. (Drawn from EEA, 2015.)\nTechnology\nTools used to facilitate or support practices, processes and behaviours with different forms and in various areas of technological development, including education, construction, transport, energy, and information and communications.\nTechnological innovation, and making better use of technology, can facilitate sustainability transitions in governance and various sectors by making urban systems more efficient, reducing resource use, supporting better informed decision-making processes, and monitoring the implementation of relevant policies. (Based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.)\n(All definitions based on EEA, 2021a, 2021b.)\nAdaptive capacity\nUrban systems with the capacity to be resilient, adaptive and responsive to a variety of chronic stresses and acute shocks, reducing vulnerability to climate change and extreme events.\nBuilt environment quality\nHigh-quality buildings, public spaces and supporting physical infrastructure, such as water supply, energy networks and transport systems, that are built to last, properly integrated with the wider urban system and effectively support sustainable urban living.\nCollaborative and

efficiently through reuse and recycling with the goal of eliminating the generation of waste.\nEnergy efficiency\nEnergy used efficiently to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, reduce energy costs for citizens and cities, and help ensure security of energy supply.\nEnvironmental quality\nA healthy and clean urban environment, including good water, air, land and soil quality and keeping pollution, including noise pollution, within strict limits.\nGreen and blue infrastructure\nAn interconnected network of natural and semi-natural areas, green or blue spaces and features that deliver a wide range of benefits to urban citizens while also enhancing biodiversity and helping to restore local ecosystems.\nGreen economy\nAn inclusive economy that is low-carbon, resource-conserving, diverse and circular and results in improved human well-being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.\nHousing quality\nHigh-quality housing stock that delivers good environmental performance and healthy homes for residents.\nIntegrated planning\nIntegrated, long-term spatial planning and design that delivers healthy, accessible, compact, economically competitive cities and sustainable, multifunctional urban peripheries that also effectively manage urban sprawl.\nLow energy consumption\nLow energy consumption and demand from citizens and cities, achieved through pro-environmental behaviours and practices that use less energy.\nParticipation and empowerment\nEmpowerment of stakeholders and citizens in relevant aspects of decision-making and knowledge creation through timely engagement and meaningful participation across all sectors of society.\nPublic open space\nGood-quality and

Cities face environmental and climate challenges but also hold keys to realise Europe\u2019s sustainability ambitions. Two new assessments on urban sustainability, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today, combine several environment and climate themes, calling for better integration of policies to address the complex and interlinked challenges through win-win solutions.\nCities are centers of innovation and economic activity but they also affected by social challenges such as segregation, poverty and inequality. Environmental challenges for cities range from worsening impacts of climate change, such as heat waves and flooding, to pollution, waste management, or loss of green spaces.\nThe EEA report thematic page on urban sustainability.brings together the Agency\u2019s recent work on urban environmental sustainability, developed together with stakeholders in the field. The main report is published together with an which completes the EEA\u2019s urban report package, available on the\nThe new assessments and the EEA\u2019s previous work emphasise that cities have a key role in Europe\u2019s transition to sustainability: cities need to address economic, social and environmental issues in an integrated way to achieve sustainability and that includes to ensure that cities are inclusive, safe and resilient.\nThe EEA report identifies several key building blocks for improving cities\u2019 sustainability, including improving the quality of the local environment, building adaptive capacity, ensuring enough public and natural areas, switching to renewable energy, and improving energy and resource efficiency. Moreover, cities should improve the quality of the built environment, including homes, and ensure social justice and inclusive participation in decision-making. While all cities are both complex and different from each other, the report identifies some shared key factors for improving their sustainability. Local culture, knowledge and quality of data can either enable or slow down improvements, and the same is true for new technology, governance, and financial management.\nThe package also presents an \u2018urban nexus approach\u2019, which can help identify problems or opportunities that are linked and, as such, support integrated and cost-effective actions. For example, in many cases cities can improve their climate resilience, quality of public spaces, ease of mobility, and air quality with integrated and targeted actions.

European cities have been at the forefront of the crisis from the very beginning, not only bearing the worst impacts but also becoming key actors in advocating for a green and just recovery. This briefing provides an initial overview of how the ongoing pandemic is reshaping urban life and discusses some of the key opportunities for achieving urban environmental sustainability in the aftermath of the crisis.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge of unprecedented proportions and cities are on the frontline of managing the crisis. There is still considerable uncertainty about the longer-term impacts of the crisis on cities. However, a growing agenda of issues that will have to be tackled in the months and years ahead is emerging. All of the following will have an impact on environmental sustainability transitions in cities:\nThis short briefing is unable to cover all of these important themes in detail. Instead it provides a brief overview of some of the main impacts that the pandemic has had on urban environmental sustainability and then summarises the key opportunities to align the recovery with the urgent transition towards more sustainable cities.\nThere is a growing movement of cities in Europe actively committing to a green recovery from the crisis \u2014 supported by initiatives at the EU level such as the European Green Deal, the urban agenda for the EU and the new EU cohesion policy. The EU\u2019s ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and its European Green Deal flagship initiative must stay on track. However, the profound societal and economic changes brought about by the crisis need to be recognised. Likewise, we need to ensure an inclusive recovery that recognises that the pandemic has further exacerbated existing inequalities within individual cities and between cities.\nWhile current efforts are rightly focused on tackling the immediate challenges of the pandemic, it is important to swiftly put in place approaches to recovery that are aligned with wider sustainability objectives. This will require active participation and full commitment at all levels of government.\nA central part of these approaches will be ensuring that local governments can play an active role in the recovery planning process at EU and national levels. Funding will also be urgently needed, e.g. by earmarking part of the Recovery and Resilience Fund directly for local governments. The economic fallout from COVID-19 has put local governments in a precarious situation in which increased expenditure and reduced revenues have led to major budget shortfalls that could jeopardise existing sustainability initiatives.\nFor all European citizens, the pandemic has resulted in abrupt changes in daily routines that have had far-reaching consequences for cities and the wider sustainability of urban systems. Although the longer-term impacts require further investigation and will differ from one city to another, there are certain patterns that already serve as an important basis for debate and discussion. Figure 1 presents some examples of the key opportunities and challenges that COVID-19 presents for urban environmental sustainability in the immediate term (pandemic response phase) and in the longer term (recovery planning phase).\nImmediate-term\nLonger-term Covid-19\nImmediate-term\nLonger-term Covid-19\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and health concerns remain paramount, cities are already taking the first steps towards recovery and leading calls for a green and just recovery. The aim is to enable cities to rebuild their economies, address complex social justice issues and tackle the climate and ecological crisis at the same time.\nThe following four areas offer particularly promising avenues for confronting this triple crisis in cities. Although they are presented as separate issues here, recent EEA work on urban sustainability highlights the critical interdependencies between the different urban sectors and systems and the importance of taking an integrated approach that recognises the important nexuses between various urban interventions and the associated policy outcomes.\nThe pandemic allowed policy experiments to be undertaken at a previously unconceivable scale and demonstrated that mobility behaviour in cities is a lot more fluid than perhaps previously assumed. Over the past year, European cities have already created more than 1 400 km of new cycle lanes, traffic-calming measures and car-free streets.\nThere is an opportunity to build on this momentum by encouraging a modal shift and permanently reallocating road space to walking and cycling \u2014 and more green space \u2014thereby avoiding a return to car-dominated cities with high levels of dangerous air pollution and congestion. This will require new regulatory interventions that deter car use and encourage the uptake of public transport and active travel. Public transport will remain the backbone of urban mobility and will need special attention, given the major revenue losses that threaten the long-term viability of entire public transport systems.\nThe pandemic also highlighted the importance of ensuring more equitable access to key services. Although most of the ideas and policy measures underpinning the 15-minute city are not new, the pandemic has clearly increased interest in the concept as a way to improve liveability, reduce carbon emissions and rebuild and future-proof urban communities. If cities are to embrace this model of urban proximity, we will need to reconsider how public and active transport is currently planned. There is a need to move away from radial transport to provide cycling networks that connect residential areas to the urban core and ensure better connections within and between the different areas.\nThe core principles of the 15-minute city\nSource: C40 Climate Leadership Group, 2020, \u2018How to build back better with a 15-minute city\u2019 .\nThere is a major opportunity for cities to invest in retrofitting their ageing building stock. This can play a central role in supporting the European Green Deal ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and meeting the goals of the new renovation wave strategy. Collectively, buildings in the EU are responsible for 40% of total energy consumption and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions.\nBuilding retrofits have considerable co-benefits beyond reducing carbon emissions, including reduced operating costs and more comfortable and healthier buildings for residents. Retrofitting also has significant job generation potential, which can help to restart the economy. For example, Lille has announced a EUR 66 million COVID-19 recovery plan, pledging EUR 35 million over the next 3 years for renovating 3 000 social housing units, more than 3 600 private homes and 600 student residences.\nBeyond green building retrofits, there will also be opportunities for cities to think creatively about repurposing buildings for alternative uses. A drastic reduction in tourist numbers has accelerated plans in some cities, such as Lisbon and Venice, to convert inner-city tourist accommodation to affordable housing. Given that the demand for city centre office space may never fully recover, some cities are exploring the potential for converting commercial buildings into housing or other uses. This will require leadership from the public sector and careful planning to ensure an appropriate mix of urban functions and land use and to update regulatory, zoning and taxation policy to enable this shift.\nThe pandemic has certainly underscored the importance of designing more flexible and modular buildings. Such buildings can be easily adapted to new uses without having to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch. This supports the EU\u2019s ambition to increase the use of circular economy principles in building design.\nUrban green infrastructure provides multiple ecosystem services, supports climate change adaptation and plays a key role in improving people\u2019s mental and physical well-being. Perhaps one of the most enduring legacies of the pandemic will be the renewed appreciation of high-quality public green spaces in cities and the importance of healthy local environments, where air, water, soil and other natural resources are protected and nurtured while also increasing cities\u2019 resilience to the effects of climate change.\nThe ability of nature-based solutions to significantly improve local air quality is particularly relevant, given that evidence now suggests that prolonged exposure to poor air quality exacerbated the health impacts of COVID-19. As cities start designing and implementing pathways for recovery from the pandemic, nature-based solutions can provide sustainable, cost-effective, win-win solutions that create economic opportunities, employment and multiple public health and well-being benefits and have a transformative impact on urban ecosystems.\nRecent EEA work has also highlighted how investments in green infrastructure can help cities adapt to a rapidly changing climate and to the increasingly extreme weather events they have to confront as a result.\nIn planning such interventions, cities will have to consider the equitable distribution of urban greening policies, and ensure that those urban communities that currently have the least access to high-quality public and green spaces are prioritised. It is also important to ensure that urban greening policies are clearly linked to wider issues related to inequities in urban planning and development processes (e.g. uneven access to other urban services such as transport). Linking urban green space policies with other policy objectives, such as an expansion in urban food production, can be an important way of building greater resilience and ensuring that the co-benefits of interventions are maximised.\nFood security is critical to urban environmental sustainability, and the pandemic has highlighted the importance of having a robust and resilient food system that can withstand sudden crises. The Commission\u2019s farm to fork strategy seeks to develop a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system. Initiatives such as the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact and the FAO urban food agenda have created platforms for cities to actively shape more sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems.\nThe pandemic has given a boost to initiatives embracing the value of growing local, organic and more seasonal food in and around urban areas. For example, Paris is expanding its \u2018Parisculteurs\u2019 programme to support local urban farms, and it is explicitly linking access to locally grown food to its 15-minute city model. In Valencia, the local green belt has become an immediate and direct source of fresh food for the city. In addition to increasing the availability of healthy produce, urban agriculture also reduces transport distances and the associated carbon emissions and has considerable climate adaptation, ecological, social and health co-benefits.\nLocal food production can also disrupt linear food systems and support cities\u2019 efforts to move towards a more circular consumption model. This may be especially the case where cities also tackle other food system issues such as food sourcing, designing and marketing healthier products, and dealing with food waste. Policies to promote local food production will need to consider its affordability for lower-income households, which often lack access to sufficient healthy food and fresh produce. A successful rethinking of urban food systems will therefore require coordinated policy and action across a complex nexus of sectors, including urban agriculture, spatial planning and social policy.\nThe early 2020s are likely to be a key turning point. The fiscal recovery packages and infrastructure investments being rolled out by city and national governments and the EU have the potential either to further entrench fossil fuel-intensive and ecologically damaging economic systems and \u2018business as usual\u2019 urbanisation patterns or to accelerate progress towards a zero-carbon, more inclusive future for Europe\u2019s cities. New EEA research explores some of the drivers and barriers that European cities face in accelerating their transition to more environmentally sustainable patterns.\nBy investing in recovery measures that prioritise zero-carbon transport, energy-efficient buildings, green and blue infrastructure, more space for nature and more resource-efficient urban living, cities can increase their resilience to future crises and ensure a just transition for all of their residents. To be truly inclusive, recovery planning needs to understand and address existing social inequalities within local communities and ensure that the needs of all, including the most vulnerable, are met. Initiatives such as the Committee of the Regions\u2019 \u2018Green Deal Going Local\u2019 will be pivotal in placing cities at the centre of the European Green Deal.\nCities have been at the forefront of responding to the pandemic, and there is growing recognition that European cities can be powerful agents of change in driving a sustainable recovery. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of both horizontal and vertical coordination of governance and the complex interlinkages between geographies, systems and policy areas. The European Urban Initiative is a new instrument to strengthen integrated and participatory approaches to sustainable urban development and to provide a stronger link to relevant EU policies and, in particular, cohesion policy investments. EU recovery funding presents a significant opportunity for cities, but only if local governments and local citizens are properly consulted in the planning and execution of recovery initiatives.\nCo-creating solutions with cities and their networks will be essential in ensuring that transformative actions can be scaled up. Networks and institutions such as Urbact, the Urban Innovative Actions, the Green City Accord, the Covenant of Mayors, ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability), Eurocities, CEMR (Council of European Municipalities and Regions) and others will play a key role in supporting cities on this journey. Opportunities for peer-to-peer learning will remain central to enabling cities to share challenges and lessons learnt in their recovery from the crisis. The Horizon Europe research programme will play a major role in driving innovation in cities with its ambitious goal of creating 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030.\nOne important legacy of the crisis is likely to be the realisation that behaviours, institutions and even infrastructure can be changed a lot faster than we may have previously assumed. European cities are not as \u2018locked in\u2019 to certain ways of doing things as previously thought. If necessary, cities can radically transform how they operate and how we live within them. This has important implications for the ambitions that cities put forward to enable the transformational systems change that will be needed to tackle the climate and ecological crisis in the years to come.\nBriefing no. 03/2021\nTitle: Urban Sustainability in Europe \u2013 opportunities for challenging times\nHTML - TH-AM-21-003-EN-Q - ISBN 978-92-9480-370-2 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/349522\nPDF - TH-AM-21-003-EN-N - ISBN 978-92-9480-369-6 - ISSN 2467-3196 - doi: 10.2800/870229\nDisclaimer\nThe country assessments are the sole responsibility of the EEA member and cooperating countries supported by the EEA through guidance, translation and editing.\n2020-2021\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/urban-sustainability-in-europe/urban-sustainability-in-europe or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 29 Jan 2022, 11:05 AM\nFiled under: green recovery sustainable cities policy integration covid-19\nFiled under: green recovery, sustainable cities, policy integration, covid-19\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others", "Do something for our planet, print this page only if needed.

Integrated urban sustainability management can make use of the structure provided by the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets, for a common assessment ground. The present study \npresents a SDG indicator pool sorted along the 17 Goals for all cities to assess their multi-dimensional progress towards sustainability. It has been published on behalf of the European Topic \nCentre on Urban, Land and Soil Systems (ETC-ULS) as an assisting research organ of the European \nEnvironment Agency (EEA).  \n \nSince the adoption of the UN SDGs in 2015 progress has been made but still there is a lot to do \nfor cities and gaps have to be filled. The SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities \npublished by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) in May 2019 states that \nmajor performance (not indicator) gaps persist on environmental goals, especially on SDG 12 \n(Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). \nThe EU and EFTA countries are among those countries that have the highest emission of CO2 per \ncapita in the world. The report also says that, having a look on the cities, all cities have to highly \nimprove their efforts for SDG 13 (Climate Action). Further efforts are needed with regard to \nreducing air pollution in most European cities. The SDSN further writes that most European cities \nare challenged with access to affordable and quality housing. Target 11.1 calls for policymakers \nto ensure access to adequate, safe and affordable housing by 2030. Furthermore, in 2017, the \nEuropean Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless published a report \nemphasising increasing trends in homelessness in cities in Europe. \n \nLet\u2019s start to fill the gaps! This report provides local governments across Europe with a large \nchoice of indicators to display and measure their progress towards the 17 SDGs and their targets. \nRather than offering a fixed set of SDG indicators, the following compilation should be the basis \nfor putting together localised monitoring systems, tailored to local circumstances, challenges \nand data availabilities. \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n5 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nHow to read this report \n \nThis report is the result of the analysis of 2,036 indicators found across 30 indicator sets published by a variety of institutions both on the global, European and national level. All of these \nindicator sets had originally been developed and published for their use at the local, urban level, \nhowever mostly without any reference to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  \nThe authors of this report allocated each of the more than two thousand indicators to one (or \nmore) of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets. Admittedly, this allocation was subjective, however \nthe first result of this allocation showed that for most of the SDGs and their targets, indicators \nfor cities already exist. Even more, after eliminating duplicates, aligning similar indicators and \ncleaning up inconsistencies in indicator titles and measurement, the choice of existing indicators \neven allowed for splitting them down into different aspects of one target.  \n \nThe result is a compilation of existing indicators developed for cities and local governments, \nstructured along the 17 SDGs, each of their 169 targets, and a variety of aspects of these targets. \nDifferent from other publications on the same topic, this report does not identify any new SDG \nindicators for cities, nor does it promote a specific set of indicators to monitor progress in \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals on the local level. It also doesn\u2019t measure or analyse any of these indicators.  \n \nThe report serves as a pool of potential indicators local governments can choose from when \ndeveloping their own, individual SDG monitoring system. This way, specific local aspects of each \ngoal and target can be reflected. Local policy priorities can be taken into account and linked to \nthe SDGs through an integrated local monitoring system. And finally, indicators can be selected \naccording to their data availability.  \n \n\nStructure of each chapter \n\nFollowing the structure of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, this report has 17 chapters \u2013 \none for each SDG. Each chapter starts with a brief introduction to the respective SDG and its \nrelevance at the local level. An overview analysis shows how many of the indicators found could \nbe allocated to which of the SDG\u2019s targets. It also highlights gaps as well as such targets for which \na particular wealth of potential indicators exists. The largest part of each chapter lists all indicators allocated to the respective SDG, split down by targets and, where applicable, particular aspects of each target. For each indicator, a dedicated title, its unit of measurement and its source \n(i.e. the indicator set it has been taken from) are displayed. For some indicators, the unit of \nmeasurement is simply the existence or non-existence of a particular feature, indicated as \n\u2018yes/no\u2019 in the tables. For some other indicators, no unit of measurement could be identified.  \n \nFor some of the SDG targets, no indicators could be allocated. This shows that there is still room \nfor improvement on the way towards integrated local monitoring systems for measuring progress towards achieving the SDGs. However, it also shows that cities and local governments cannot implement the SDGs alone. Some issues are better addressed and monitored at the national \nlevel, and a multilevel approach to achieving the goals is needed.\n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n6 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\n  \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n7 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\n \n \n55 per cent of the world\u2019s population have no access to social \nprotection. That\u2019s why poverty will remain one of the main issues within the next decades. Poverty means not only the absence of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood. For the people being poor it also means hunger and \nmalnutrition, limited or no access to education and other \nbasic services, social discrimination and exclusion and often \nalso the lack of participation in decision-making. That\u2019s why \nan inclusive economic growth is needed that provides sustainable jobs and promotes equality. Social protection systems \nwill help coping with the above mentioned challenges, because they help afflicted populations in case of unexpected \neconomic losses during disasters and they guarantee a minimum supply for the poorest. \n\nRelevance for cities and local governments \n\nCities offer a great scope of job opportunities, they can increase living standards and empower people to make decisions about their lives. Challenges for the cities are the inefficient and often unequal land use and housing markets, lack of \naccess to basic services and existing socio-economic traps. Local governments have the chance to identify those that live in \npoverty. They can target resources and services directly to \nthem to help them getting out of it. They can target urban \nhousing, planning and architectural design that affects the \ncreation and distribution of wealth both in newly built and already existing high-risk urban neighborhoods. Elementary is \nthe strengthening of inclusive education to enhance employability.\n\nEND POVERTY  \nIN ALL ITS \nFORMS            \nEVERYWHERE \n\f\n \n \nSDG 1 \n \n\n8 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 1 l Overview \n \nThe 45 indicators found for SDG 1 show a significant focus on target 1.2 (poverty reduction in all \nits dimensions), dealing with the national poverty line, the household financial situation and \npoverty risk.  \n \nTarget 1.4 (access to economic resources, services, ownership) can also be measured by many \nindicators dealing with housing, such as access to property, affordability of housing and subsidies. Nonetheless, the target is not entirely covered, as there is no indicator dealing with access \nto microfinance for instance. \n \nThe other targets, 1.5. (build resilience), 1.3 (implement social protection systems), 1.a (resources allocated to end poverty) are covered with lower number of indicators. However, the \nindicators found are highly relevant for their corresponding target. \n \nIn contrast target 1.b (pro-poor and gender-sensitive policy frameworks) has no indicator as the \ntarget is not applicable at the local level (but at the regional, national and international level). \nTarget 1.1 (eradicate extreme poverty), measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day, is \nrepresented only by one indicator, which reflects its comparably low relevance for European \ncities. \n \nIn conclusion, most relevant targets of SDG 1 from an urban perspective are well covered with \na good choice of potential indicators. \n \nFigure 1: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 1 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people\neverywhere, currently measured as people living on\u2026\n\n1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of\nmen, women and children of all ages living in\u2026\n\n1.3  Implement nationally appropriate social\nprotection systems and measures for all, including\u2026\n\n1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in\nparticular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal\u2026\n\n1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those\nin vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure\u2026\n\n1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a\nvariety of sources, including through enhanced\u2026\n\n1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national,\nregional and international levels, based on pro-poor\u2026\n\nSDG 1 - No Poverty\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 1 \n \n\n9 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 1 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget 1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nCity population living below the international poverty line % 6 \n\nTarget 1.2.

As more and more land is populated and soil is \nsealed, farmers have to produce food for a growing population on less agricultural land. Climate change and air pollution increase negative effects on food production - soils, \nfreshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are more and \nmore degraded. Together, all of this puts pressure on the resources humankind depends on, the danger of disasters like \ndroughts and floods is increasing. Fast food finds its way into \ndaily life \u2013 frequently implying malnutrition and other health \nissues like diabetes or overweight.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nImplementing sustainable agricultural practices can help ensure future food security, depending on increased investment in rural infrastructure and agricultural research. But \nalso cities and local governments have to contribute. They \ncan set an example of healthy and regional food supply: In \npublic institutions like kindergartens, schools, hospitals etc. \nthe provision of food can happen in cooperation with local \nsuppliers and farmers. Local initiatives like nutrition councils \ncan be supported and of course responsibility doesn\u2019t end at \nthe city-border. Buying fair trade products in the frame of \npublic procurement is one possibility to think outside the \nbox. Malnutrition and obesity can be faced with public information services, special public training courses or collaborations with sports associations. The waste of food should be \navoided. \n  \n\nEND HUNGER, \nACHIEVE FOOD \nSECURITY AND \nIMPROVED    \nNUTRITION \n\f\n \n \nSDG 2 \n \n\n16 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 2 l Overview  \n \nAmong the 122 indicators found for SDG 2, the majority was allocated to target 2.4 (ensure \nsustainable food systems), covering topics such as land use, city self-sufficiency, volume of food \nproduction, eco-practices, eco-policies, circular economy and \u201cfood print\u201d.  \n \nIndicators of target 2.3 (double productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers) address \naspects such as access to land, job creation, farmers\u2019 income and access to financial services, \ntraining and local market opportunities via supply/value chains and procurement contracts.  \n \nTarget 2.1 (ensure food access by all) can count on a variety of indicators addressing aspects of \nfood security, vulnerability and accessibility. Agri-prosumerism indicators were also included \nhere with the idea that urban agriculture can contribute to lower food vulnerability. \n \nTarget 2.2 (end all form of malnutrition) gathers a good amount of indicators dealing with general and children malnutrition (undernourishment and over-nourishment), as well as household \nfood baskets.  \n \nIn contrast, targets 2.5 to 2.c have a very low or inexistent coverage by indicators. This may \nreflect their more national-level oriented topics. Indeed, indicators found for these targets explicitly refer to national and international responsibilities.  \n \nThe biggest contribution to this SDG is the RUAF Indicator Framework, especially developed for \nCity Region Food Systems \u2013 thus most indicators are applicable to the urban context.

Within the last ten years significant improvements \nhave been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing \nchild and maternal mortality as well as HIV infections. Still, \nmore than six million children die before getting 5 years old \nevery year. In our modern society people are getting older than \never before. Their wellbeing and health care has to be guaranteed. Also further, new health related issues have to be taken \ninto account, such as substance abuse, traffic accidents, air- \nand water-borne pollution as well as bacterial and virus pandemics.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nCities and their local governments can play a decisive role with \nregard to the health and well-being of their inhabitants. Proper \nhousing and sanitation, access to food, health and medical facilities have a great influence on the well-being of people. Furthermore, air quality and access to green spaces like parks, gardens, sports fields as well as swimming pools or camping \ngrounds play an important role. To improve the air that people \nbreathe sustainable urban mobility is a key issue in terms of \naccessible public transport or safe walking and cycling paths. \nAs access to addictive substances like tobacco, alcohol and \ndrugs is easier in cities than in rural areas substance abuse is \nmore common \u2013 and thus a challenge for the cities to take care \nof. Family and other social bonds tend to be less strong in cities, that\u2019s why it is important to build substitute structures especially with a view to elderly people who have no family to \ncare for them. \n \n\nENSURE \nHEALTHY LIVES \nAND  PROMOTE \nWELL-BEING FOR \nALL AT ALL AGES \n\f\n \n \nSDG 3 \n\n30  ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 3 l Overview \n \n\nThe 127 indicators found for SDG 3 show a predominant concentration on targets 3.4 (preventing non-communicable diseases) and 3.9 (environmental pollution impacting human health). \nHere target 3.4, particularly reflects on the aspects of life expectancy, general and specific mortality rates, food safety, diet and habits influencing health and linked policies and diseases. For \ntarget 3.9, there is a considerable amount of indicators related to hazardous chemicals and air \nquality, as well as pollution from agriculture, electromagnetic fields, noise and light. Indicators \ntypically assess and monitor either levels of pollution, the population exposure or the existence \nof policies addressing these environmental issues. \n \nTargets 3.8 (universal health coverage) and 3.6 (road traffic injuries and deaths) are well represented by indicators showing high relevance for the corresponding targets. Targets 3.1 (maternal mortality) and 3.2 (child mortality) see fewer indicators, which however reflects the specificy \nof the phenomena they address. \n \nIn contrast, targets 3.3 (AIDS and other communicable diseases), 3.5 (substance abuse such as \ntobacco and other drugs), 3.7 (family planning), 3.b (research for vaccines and medicines), show \ninsufficient coverage by indicators. These gaps may be explained by the fact that related data \nare typically processed at the national level. They may however also indicate a lower level of \npriority of these targets at the local level. \n \nTarget 3.a (WHO convention on tobacco control) has no corresponding local indicators as it represents rules that govern the production, sale, distribution, advertisement, and taxation of tobacco, which are typically decided upon at national and international level. \n \nIn the case of target 3.c (health financing and workforce in developing countries) not a single \nindicator could be identified across the indicator sets. This can be explained by the target\u2019s focus \non developing, least-developed countries and small islands \u2013 which does not resonate directly \nwith European local governments\u2019 concerns. \n \nTarget 3.d (risk reduction and management of global health risks) surprisingly shows only one \nindicator that could be used to address pandemics coming from industrial animal farming locally. \nThere seems to be a serious gap that should be filled with more specific indicators on bacterial \nand virus risks.  \n \nA large amount of the indicator sets included in this study address this SDG, such as The EU \nGreen City Tool, City Prosperity Index, \u201cFirst generation of EU Common Indicators: Towards a \nLocal Sustainability Profile\u201d and others. In terms of measurement units, the majority of indicators are quantitative, however some qualitative ones particularly address the satisfaction of the \npopulation with health services. \n \n  \n\f\n

It\u2019s a key instrument to tackle poverty and develop instruments and strategies to achieve progress in all aspects of sustainable development. Education is still affected by a number of existing and \nalso growing socio-economic inequalities like gender, race, income - and age. Education doesn\u2019t stop in adolescence, adult \neducation is an important issue. Train the trainers - also the \nteachers have to be taken into account. The reasons for lack of \nquality education are often due to a lack of adequately trained \nteachers or even poor conditions of schools and equity issues \ne.g. concerning rural children.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nQuality education and urban development are closely connected. Cities have always been centres of knowledge creation \nand innovation. National education systems as well as culture \noften depend on progress made in cities \u2013 they act as forerunners. Still many cities do not provide inclusive and equitable \neducation and thus socio-economic inequalities are growing. \nPrimary level education is a direct responsibility of local governments in most countries. Education governance therefore \nneeds to be improved regarding inclusion, accountability and \nquality, and training programmes should be included in local \neconomic development strategies. A further possibility is the \nsupport of cooperation between different schools but also research institutions and local businesses. Lifelong learning \nshould be supported and offered. \n  \n\nENSURE             \nINCLUSIVE AND \nEQUITABLE \nQUALITY          \nEDUCATION \nAND PROMOTE \nLIFELONG \nLEARNING  \nOPPORTUNITIES \nFOR ALL. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 4 \n \n\n46 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 4 l Overview \n \n\n80 indicators are allocated to SDG 4 in a relatively balanced manner, although there is a slight \nfocus on target 4.a (education facilities). Target 4.a has been interpreted here in a broad sense, \nincluding the existence and quality of facilities (buildings and material), their integration in urban planning and resource consumption (e.g. water, energy), green procurement practices, the \nstimulating learning conditions their offer, and the presence of public libraries in the city. \n \nTarget 4.3 is the second most represented target with indicators addressing aspects such as \nyouth enrolment and expenditures for different levels of education, especially the post-secondary one (including universities). The phenomenon of early leavers was recurring in various indicator sets. \n \nTarget 4.5 (disparities and access to education) is covered by more general indicators as well as \nmore specific ones on gender and vulnerable sub-groups, such as learners with special needs. \nSchool feeding programmes were integrated here as the performance of the students at school \ncan be unfairly influenced by lifestyles at home (depending on their socio-economic status). \n \nTargets 4.7, 4.4, 4.1 are addressed by modest but sufficient numbers of indicators.

Still, women and girls \nare often more affected than men and boys by poverty, food \ninsecurity and environmental pollution. SDG 5 aims at ending \ndiscrimination and violence against women and girls as well as \nensuring that they have equal opportunities in life that boys \nand men already have. At the current time, 1 in 5 women and \ngirls between the ages of 15-49 have reported experiencing \nphysical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12month period and 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence (UN 2019).  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nGrowing cities imply opportunities for social, economic, cultural and political participation that facilitate gender empowerment. Still not only gender, race, ethnicity or age, but also \ninherited income and status are discriminatory grounds for \nwomen and girls in cities \u2013 especially manifested in illegal settlements where levels of vulnerability disproportionately affect \nwomen, youth and children. Cities can address such cross-cutting issues in order to have direct impact on breaking these circles of social exclusion. Local governments need to set a good \nexample through non-discriminatory service provision to citizens and fair employment practices. Getting more female leaders in local governments empowers women but also challenges \ngender stereotypes and sets an example to young girls. Targeting maternity and childcare benefits, as well as workforce integration trainings would be a further possibility.  \n\nACHIEVE       \nGENDER \nEQUALITY AND \nEMPOWER ALL \nWOMEN AND \nGIRLS. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 5 \n \n\n58 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 5 l Overview \n \nFor SDG 5, 33 indicators were found and could be allocated among half of the targets.

This is the case for the targets 5.3 \n(elimination of harmful practices), 5.6 (reproductive rights), 5.a (ownership by women), and 5.b \n(empowerment by technology).

This requires the \nurgent need of a better management of water and sanitation \nto guarantee human wellbeing, while preserving the resilience \nof the ecosystem. At the current time, more than 2 billion people are living with the risk of reduced access to freshwater resources and by 2050, at least one in four people is likely to live \nin a country affected by chronic or recurring shortages of fresh \nwater. Good water quality is not only a matter of the so called \ndeveloping countries \u2013 also in Europe a lot of people prefer \nbuying water in bottles than drinking the water that comes out \nof their taps. Bottles that often are made out of plastic \u2013 and \nmean a high waste volume.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nDue to freshwater lakes, rivers and underground water sources \nwater supply seems to be unlimited in Europe. But environmental pollution, negative impacts of climate change as well as \npopulation growth and the increasing urbanisation have a \nhighly negative impact on the water supply and its quality \u2013 \nmaking it a challenge especially for cities.  Only 20% of the water provided by public water supply is really used. The other \n80% go back to the environment primarily as treated \nwastewater. Sealed and concreted surfaces cause that rain water flows into the waste water system \u2013 instead of feeding the \naquifers. If cities change their water supply systems they can \nreuse the so called grey water, such as water from taps, showers and the kitchen. It can be reused, for example, for toilet \nflushing.   \n\nENSURE    \nAVAILABILITY \nAND                \nSUSTAINABLE \nMANAGEMENT \nOF WATER AND \nSANITATION \nFOR ALL. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 6 \n \n\n64 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 6 l Overview \n \n\n59 indicators were identified to potentially monitor progress towards SDG 6 locally. Targets 6.4 \n(water use efficiency) and 6.3 (wastewater reduction) have most of the indicators allocated.  \nProper water management strategies or policies help reduce fresh water consumption as well \nas the amount of treated water. Target 6.4 gathers indicators dealing with water use efficiency, \nwater use reduction, sustainable withdrawal and stormwater management. Indicators for target \n6.3 focus on wastewater treatment capacity, the quality of treatment, and how well the population is connected to it. They also address nutrient and nitrogen recovery and ground water \nquality. Target 6.2 (sanitation) is linked to 6.3 but only one indicator was found that specifically \ncovers that target well. \n \nTarget 6.6 (water-related ecosystems) is strongly linked to target 15.1 (freshwater ecosystems). \nTarget 6.1 (access to water) refers specifically to drinking water, its quality, costs and irregularities in supply, as well as specific sector consumption. \n \nIn contrast, target 6.5 (transboundary water management) is poorly represented and for target \n6.b (local communities support) not a single indicator could be allocated, although both targets \ncould be considered important and relevant for the local level.  \n \nTarget 6.a (international cooperation and capacity building) has no indicators allocated either, \nhowever this gap seems justifiable with the international dimension of this target. \n \nFigure 6: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 6 \n\n   \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to\nsafe and affordable drinking water for all\n\n6.2\u00a0By 2030, achieve access to adequate and\nequitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end\u2026\n\n6.3\u00a0By 2030, improve water quality by reducing\npollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing\u2026\n\n6.4\u00a0By 2030, substantially increase water-use\nefficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable\u2026\n\n6.5\u00a0By 2030, implement integrated water resources\nmanagement at all levels, including through\u2026\n\n6.6\u00a0By 2020, protect and restore water-related\necosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands,\u2026\n\n6.a\u00a0By 2030, expand international cooperation and\ncapacity-building support to developing countries in\u2026\n\n6.b\u00a0Support and strengthen the participation of local\ncommunities in improving water and sanitation\u2026\n\nSDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 6 \n \n\n65 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 6 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  6.1  By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all  \n\nGeneral access \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nDoes your city collect (or have access to) good data on drinking water consumption by: \n- Private homes / households? \n- Businesses/industry? \n- Public services (i.e. schools, hospitals, municipal buildings etc.) \n\nyes/no 14 \n\nPopulation connected to potable drinking water system % 10 \n\nTotal drinking water consumption m\u00b3/year 13 \n\nMedian price paid per 1000 litres of water in euros, at the time of year when \nwater is most expensive \n\nEUR/1 000 litres \n\n1 \n\nHow many days of non-compliance with the Drinking Water Directive?

That\u2019s why access to energy for \nall is essential. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes. As the global energy supply still \nconsists for about 81.3% of - finite - fossil fuels, the transition \nto renewable energy is the main intention of SDG 7:  Using the \ndiversity of resources, combined with modern energy efficient \ntechnologies that address climate change mitigation, efficient \nenergy generation and demand, and resilient energy infrastructure. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nIn cities, most energy is consumed in the building, transport, \nwater and waste sectors - with greenhouse gas emissions released due to burning fossil fuels. According to their geographical conditions as well as their design and planning cities have \nto move towards more decentralized and smart systems. Even \nif energy is often provided by private sector or national agencies, local governments can accelerate the local sustainable energy transition. They can provide leadership, guidance and regulations to support the energy transition. They can also develop or redesign energy efficient buildings. Another important \ntool is eco-mobility that reduces energy consumption and \nswitches to clean fuels. Cities can encourage the use of renewables in procurement practices and in regulations for energy \nuse by homeowners, public services, and if possible private \nbusinesses. Last but not least providing financial incentives like \ncongestion charges or tax discounts for the use of green energy \nis another helpful way to encourage change.  \n\nENSURE           \nACCESS TO       \nAFFORDABLE, \nRELIABLE,      \nSUSTAINABLE \nAND MODERN \nENERGY FOR \nALL. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 7 \n \n\n74 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 7 l Overview \n \n\nMost indicators found for SDG 7 could be allocated to target 7.2 (share of renewable energy), \nincluding also aspects such as residential and public energy consumption, as well as local policies \nfor cleaner and more efficient energy production. \n \nA considerable amount of indicators could also be found for target 7.3 (energy efficiency), \nmainly addressing aspects such as energy consumption, the availability of energy efficiency \nplans, and energy efficiency of buildings.  \n \nIndicators identified for target 7.1 (energy access) cover topics such as affordability, reliability \nand modernity of energy services. \n \nTargets 7.a (international co-operation) and 7.b (support modern energy infrastructure in least \ndeveloped countries) are hardly represented by indicators here, however this could have been \nexpected as they explicitly address global policy issues going far beyond city boarders. \n \nIn summary it can be said that those targets of SDG 7 most relevant for European local governments can be monitored sufficiently.  \n \n\nFigure 7: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 7 \n\n \n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n7.1  By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable,\nreliable and modern energy services\n\n7.2  By 2030, increase substantially the share of\nrenewable energy in the global energy mix\n\n7. 3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement\nin energy efficiency\n\n7.a  By 2030, enhance international cooperation to\nfacilitate access to clean energy research and\u2026\n\n7.B  By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade\ntechnology for supplying modern and sustainable\u2026\n\nSDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 7 \n \n\n75 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 7 l Indicators \n\nTarget  7.1  By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services \n\nAffordable energy \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nPopulation with access to electricity % 1, 4, 6, \n7 \n\nPercentage of electricity customers with demand response capabilities % 7 \n\nHas your city made projections of future developments in energy supply and \ndemand?

The more important is it to develop and design \nit in a prospective and sustainable way. This requires societies \nto create the conditions that stimulate sustainable business \ndevelopment and job creation, while at the same time not \nharming the environment. These job opportunities and working conditions have to be provided for all, thus for the whole \nworking age population. This comprises a major challenge for \nthe whole development agenda. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nNearly 80 percent of the Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \nis generated by and in cities. They are centers of economic production and consumption activities, commerce and money distribution. There is a direct relationship between urbanisation \nand sustainable economic and social development: Countries \nwith the highest per capita income are usually more urbanised \nwhereas low-income countries are often less urbanised. Thus \nsustainable economic growth of a country highly depends on \nthe sustainable development of its cities - they need new and \ninclusive economic models in cities. Local governments can \nstimulate and support responsible local businesses that keep \nmoney in the community and provide jobs. Enhancing highquality education is the basis to develop a skilled workforce \nand fight poverty, also addressing youth unemployment challenges. With view to their global responsibility local governments can support sustainable and fair trade procurement. \n \n  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 8 \n \n\n82 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 8 l Overview \n \n\nFor SDG 8, a total of 108 indicators could be allocated, showing a predominating focus on targets \n8.5 (full employment and decent work for all) across the indicator sets screened. This target \naddresses aspects such as disparities in employment and income, as well as the type of employment (part-time, temporary, instability), the role of the informal sector, the presence of \u2018working poor\u2019, and the overall satisfaction with the labor market. Many of the indicators found were \nvariations of employment and unemployment rates and have been merged. \n \nThe second most addressed target is 8.2 (economic productivity), covering topics such as innovation, high-tech workforce, economic specialisation and density. It is followed by target 8.3 (job \ncreation), mirrored by indicators on business and green job creation. Target 8.9 (sustainable \ntourism) addresses issues such as cultural heritage and the tourism sector in general, with a view \non further job creation. \n \nTarget 8.1 (GDP) finds a broad offer of GDP-based or GDP-oriented indicators. Although questioned more and more widely over the past years, GDP growth seems to remain the number \none indicator of a successful, healthy economy and society. Other societal progress indicators \nmay be needed to measure SDG 8 \u201cbeyond GDP\u201d.  \n \nTarget 8.4 (decouple environmental degradation from economic growth) already leads the way \ninto this narrative, supported by indicators on public and private engagement.

Sustainable investments in infrastructure like transport, \nirrigation, energy and information and communication technology are thus crucial for achieving sustainable development. \nThe technological progress is also important to achieve environmental objectives, such as increased resource and energyefficiency. Without technology and innovation, industrialisation will not happen, and without industrialisation, development will not happen.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nInfrastructure and technological and social innovation are \nhighly related to the city and spatial planning. Often there is a \ncoexistence of different areas in cities: Those that are well developed and those that are less developed with inadequate \nhousing, scarce services, and deficient mobility and logistical \nnetworks. The role of local governments is quite complex, \noverseeing the interconnected urban systems, services and \nflows related to local production and consumption (e.g. waste \nmanagement, energy supply, water and sanitation, transportation). For a prosperous development of a city it is important to \nsupport also \u201cthe little ones\u201d, thus integrating small-scale industries and start-ups into local economic development strategies. To increase the resilience of a city a mix of green, blue \nand gray infrastructure is needed. This means also an increasing sustainability of infrastructure, buildings and industry \nthrough cradle-to-cradle construction (full life cycle planning).  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 9 \n \n\n96 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 9 l Overview \n \n\nThis SDG is mirrored by 62 different indicators with an unbalanced distribution among its targets. With 40 indicators allocated to it, target 9.1 (infrastructure) represents the key target of \nSDG 9. Aspects addressed include regional collaboration, transport infrastructure in general and \nmore specifically public and soft mobility modes. Electric mobility, water infrastructure and food \ninfrastructure are also integrated here although more indicators can be found in related topic \nspecific targets under other SDGs (SDG 2, SDG 6 and SDG 11). Phone and internet networks are \nimportant indicators here, but can also be found under SDG 17. \n \nTarget 9.2 (industrialization) comes far behind as the second most addressed target of this SDG. \nIts indicators focus on green jobs, innovative businesses and skill training. Target 9.5 (technological capabilities) refers to monitoring the number of researchers and the financial resources \nspent on research in relation to local GDP. \n \nTargets 9.3 (increase access to financial services) and 9.4. (retrofit industries to resource-use \nefficiency and clean technologies) are addressed by a few indicators only and could clearly benefit from an identification of some more relevant ones. \n \nTargets 9.a (facilitate resilient infrastructure development in developing countries), 9.b (support \ndomestic research and development in developing countries), and 9.c (access to information \nand communication technologies in least developed countries) all refer to measures targeted to \ndeveloping and least developed countries, which explains the absence of indicators found to \nassess them in European cities. \n \nIn summary, the choice of indicators found in the sets screened for this study appears too small \nto assess and monitor SDG 9 and improve infrastructure and industry at the local level.  \n \nFigure 9: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 9 \n\n \n \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n9.1  Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and\u2026\n\n9.2  Promote inclusive and sustainable \u2026\n\n9.3  Increase the access of small-scale industrial and\u2026\n\n9.4  By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit\u2026\n\n9.5  Enhance scientific research, upgrade the\u2026\n\n9.a  Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure\u2026\n\n9.b  Support domestic technology development,\u2026\n\n9.c  Significantly increase access to information and\u2026\n\nSDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 9 \n \n\n97 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 9 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  9.1  Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, \nincluding regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic \ndevelopment and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all \n\nAspect  Regional collaboration \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nDoes your city cooperate with other authorities at different levels or other \norganisations (regional, national, EU, international) on environmental and \nsustainability issues? \n\nyes/no 13 \n\nIn your transport planning processes, do you systematically involve: \n- all city departments that might have an interest in how the transport systems functions, including transport; land-use and spatial planning; social services; energy; health; education; enforcement and policing? \n- neighbouring urban areas? \n- neighbouring rural areas? \n- different levels of administration and government?

This means sustainable development and making the planet better for all \nwon\u2019t be possible if people are excluded from opportunities, \nservices, and the chance for a better life. Despite progress in \nsome areas, income inequality continues to rise in many parts \nof the world. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nToday, cities generate nearly 80 percent of the global GDP. But \nthey also have the highest economic gaps between people. \nMost inequalities happen to be a result of different combined \nfactors such as weak economic development and planning as \nwell as rapid and uncontrolled processes of urbanisation. To \nmanage these processes well is the challenge for cities and \ntheir governments. Otherwise, economic gaps and social fragmentation will grow. In practice this means to provide equal \naccess to urban services, strengthen governance by promoting \naccountability and fighting corruption, institutional and financial support for the most deprived areas, provide information \non how to recover from disasters and poverty traps and support sustainable business ethics \u2013 not only with a view to the \nlocal and regional economy but also globally: How can a city \nreduce inequality in foreign countries?

Indicators display different aspects of inclusion, spanning from \nsocial, economic and political to cultural inclusion. \n \nTarget 10.4 (social protection policies) is also well covered with a focus on housing subsidies and \nsocial aid. Target 10.1 (income growth) is mainly mirrored by indicators on income levels and \ninequalities. Indicators from SDG 1 could be used to complete these targets when/if needed. \n \nTarget 10.3 (equal opportunity) showcases indicators dealing with care and education, linking \nup to gender equality and upward mobility. Target 10.7 (migration policies) is addressed by a \nlow number of indicators, however they may be sufficient to assess and monitor this target \nthanks to the good balance between qualitative and quantitative indicators. \n \nOut of ten, the remaining five targets are hardly addressed by any indicators at all. This may \nmainly be due to the fact that these targets are about global policy issues and go far beyond city \nboarders. \n \nMost SDG 10 targets are tightly intertwined with SDG 1, and only few of those targets related \nto global or national policies and measures can be handled by local policies.  \n \n\nFigure 10: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 10 \n\n \n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n10.1\u00a0By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain\nincome growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the\u2026\n\n10.2\u00a0By 2030, empower and promote the social,\neconomic and political inclusion of all, irrespective\u2026\n\n10.3\u00a0Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities\nof outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory\u2026\n\n10.4\u00a0Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social\nprotection policies, and progressively achieve\u2026\n\n10.5\u00a0Improve the regulation and monitoring of global\nfinancial markets and institutions and strengthen\u2026\n\n10.6\u00a0Ensure enhanced representation and voice for\ndeveloping countries in decision-making in global\u2026\n\n10.7\u00a0Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible\nmigration and mobility of people, including through\u2026\n\n10.A\u00a0Implement the principle of special and\ndifferential treatment for developing countries, in\u2026\n\n10.B\u00a0Encourage official development assistance and\nfinancial flows, including foreign direct investment,\u2026\n\n10.C\u00a0By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the\ntransaction costs of migrant remittances and\u2026\n\nSDG 10 - Reduced inequalities\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n\nSDG 10 \n \n\n107 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 10 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  10.1  By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the \nbottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national \naverage \n\nAspect  Income levels \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nFamily income and size EUR/# 25 \n\nLow income household % 16 \n\nMid-level income households: Share of households with an annual income \nbetween 25.000 and 50.000 EUR \n\n% 23 \n\nHigh income households: Share of households with more than 50.000 EUR \nannual income \n\n% 23 \n\n \n\nAspect  Income inequalities \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nGini Coefficient  Coefficient  \n(1-100) \n\n4, 7, 8, \n28, 30 \n\nIncome inequalities Ratio 8 , 21 , \n25 \n\nDemonstrate that income inequality in the region and locally is decreasing \nover time \n\nyes/no 24 \n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 10 \n \n\n108 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nTarget  10.2  By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political \ninclusion of all, irrespective  \nof age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or \nother status \n\nAspect  Social inclusion \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nPeople at risk of poverty or social exclusion % 2, 8, \n17, 25, \n29, 30 \n\nPercentage of local budget dedicated to Deprived Neighbourhoods Areas \ncompared to global local budget % 8 \n\nDemonstrate that at least 80% of residents report positive levels of neighborhood cohesion through community surveys \nOR Demonstrate an increased percentage of residents reporting positive \nlevels of neighborhood cohesion through community surveys \n\nyes/no 24 \n\nDemonstrate that 70% or more of surveyed seniors view the community as \nmeeting their needs \n\nyes/no 24 \n\nDemonstrate the following challenges to seniors living independently are \nless than the national values for: \n\u2022 Responsibility for grandchildren;

Over 3.5 billion people live in cities today and in future even more people \nwill live there: By 2030, almost 75 percent of the world\u2019s population will be urban habitants. Cities are responsible for up to \n80 percent of overall energy use and 75 percent of greenhouse \ngas emissions \u2013 their impact is quite big! \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nSDG 11 explicitly refers to cities. Common urban challenges include traffic, lack of funds to provide basic services, a shortage \nof adequate housing, declining infrastructure and rising air pollution within cities. Local governments can support integrated \nand sustainable urban planning and management. It\u2019s in their \nresponsibility to ensure that housing services are affordable, \nadequate and safe. Low carbon development strategies, sustainable waste management and closed material cycles reduce \nenvironmental impacts and the resource foot-prints of cities. \nIn this regard sustainable urban mobility and inclusive public \ntransport systems play an important role. To increase the living \nquality in cities it\u2019s important to provide access to green and \npublic spaces for all. Not only the city itself plays an important \nrole \u2013 it is highly connected to peri-urban and rural areas and \nthus should support positive economic, social and environmental links between those areas. Strategic partnerships with businesses as well as green public procurement can foster sustainable local economies and technological development.  \n\n  \n\nMAKE CITIES \nAND HUMAN \nSETTLEMENTS \nINCLUSIVE, \nSAFE,                  \nRESILIENT AND \nSUSTAINABLE. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 11 \n \n\n114 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 11 l Overview \n \nNot unexpectedly, a total of 389 different indicators could be allocated to SDG 11. Their distribution shows a focus on target 11.2 (transport systems) that mainly deals with transport modes \nand public transport. It addresses aspects such as existing transport planning policies and targets, and green transport (e.g. electric vehicles, low emissions public transport fleet).  \n \nTarget 11.3 (inclusive and sustainable urbanisation) is the second most represented target and \nincludes aspects such as land use, city planning, urban sprawl and citizen participation. There \nare fewer indicators for sustainable urbanisation, e.g. compactness or land recycling. \n \nTarget 11.6 (environmental impact of cities) is displayed by indicators focusing on three topics \nregulated by European Commission Directives: Air quality (levels of pollutants and exceedance), \nnoise (people exposed to high levels of noise) and waste (solid waste and hazardous waste). This \ntarget overlaps strongly with SDG 3 and SDG 12. \n \nTarget 11.7 (access to green public space) is addressed by indicators on public open spaces, \ngreen areas and parks (with a wide range of metrics), as well as urban blue areas, presence of \ntrees and the perception by local residents. \n \nTarget 11.1 (access to adequate housing and basic services) is strongly focused on quality and \naffordability of housing conditions, including living space, informal housing, evictions and homeless people, housing costs, social housing and subsidies. Accessibility to basic services and food \nis also addressed. \n \nTarget 11.4 (cultural heritage) gathers indicators on the presence of historic cultural and natural \nvalue found in the city and their related preservation policies. It also proposes indicators on the \nliving culture and recreation possibilities. \n \nTarget 11.5 (human and economic impacts of disasters) is mirrored by indicators on related human and economic loss, vulnerability to general environmental disasters and more specifically \nto floods. It also provides important indicators on the response to emergencies from the public \nservices. Target 11.b (adaptation to, and mitigation of climate change) goes in the continuity of \nthis target as it casts indicators on knowledge of climate change impact and risks, disaster preparedness and resilience, water-related disasters management and respect to code standards \nto diminish buildings vulnerability. \n \nTarget 11.a (regional development planning) compiles a few indicators on urban-urban linkages, \nincluding the topic of green infrastructure. \n \nThe only target without any indicator allocated is target 11.c (support use of local material in \nleast developed countries), which can be explained by the international dimension of this target \n\u2013 outside of the scope of a European local government. \n \nIn summary, there is a good, even overwhelming, coverage of SDG 11 targets with potential \nindicators. This doesn\u2019t surprise too much, as this SDG explicitly addresses cities. In order to \nassess and further monitor the progress made towards this goal, a thorough selection of the \nmost relevant indicators is recommended. \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 11 \n\n \n\n115 ETC/ULS Report |

If human society continues to de\nvelop at its current pace, it is estimated that global resource \n\nuse will quadruple within the next two decades. Thus sustaina\nble consumption and production is key to promoting resource \n\nand energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing \n\naccess to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better \n\nquality of life for all.  \n\n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nCities as public authorities can play a key role and set a good \nexample: They are large buyers and thus have a certain market \npower. The increasing urbanisation will cause also increasing \nconsumption of energy, land and water. The purchasing decisions cities make can help influencing the development of new, \nmore sustainable products and services. Therefore, ensuring \nsustainable public procurement that takes resource use and \nemissions into account plays a key role for SDG 12. A further \nstep needed is to support and develop short supply chains to \navoid transport and carbon emissions. Like in SDG 11 strengthening waste management systems, encouraging recycling, reduction and recovery of waste supports a sustainable way of \ndevelopment. Citizens should be encouraged and enabled to \nchoose products and services with a lower resource footprint.   \n\nENSURE          \nSUSTAINABLE \nCONSUMPTION \nAND                  \nPRODUCTION \nPATTERNS. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 12 \n \n\n150 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 12 l Overview \n \n\nIn SDG 12, a variety of aspects of a circular economy and a sustainable society are addressed. \nIndicators allocated show a predominance in target 12.5 (waste reduction), measuring aspects \nsuch as waste generation, collection, recycling, management, prevention and reduction, as well \nas waste recovery in the food system. \n \nTarget 12.2 (sustainable and efficient use of natural resources) is the target second most represented by indicators, which address issues such as general resource management and resource \nuse efficiency (e.g. land, buildings, energy, industry, water, food and forests). Targets 12.8 (information and awareness), 12.7 (sustainable public procurement) and 12.4 (management of \nchemicals and other wastes) can count on decent numbers of potential indicators as well. \n \nMost other targets are sufficiently covered by indicators, except for targets 12.1 and 12.c: Whilst  \ntarget 12.1 is specifically linked to the UN 10-Year Framework Programme on sustainable production and consumption, target 12.c seems not to be of much relevance for local policy making \nas it is about subsidies for fossil-fuels, which are typically decided at national level. \n \nA large number of those indicators sets screened contributes to this SDG, particularly the EU \nGreen City Tool and EEA Urban Metabolism Framework. There is a good balance between qualitative and quantitative units of measurement. \n \nFigure 12: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 12 \n \n\n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n12.1 Implement the 10-year framework of\u2026\n\n12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management\u2026\n\n12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at\u2026\n\n12.4 By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound\u2026\n\n12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation\u2026\n\n12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and\u2026\n\n12.7 Promote public procurement practices that are\u2026\n\n12.8 By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have\u2026\n\n12.a Support developing countries to strengthen\u2026\n\n12.b Develop and implement tools to monitor\u2026\n\n12.c Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that\u2026\n\nSDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 12 \n\n \n\n151 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 12 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  12.1  Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programs on sustainable \nconsumption and production (10YFP), all countries taking action, with \ndeveloped countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries \n\nNo indicators identified. \n\nTarget  12.2  By 2030, achieve sustainable management and efficient use of  \nnatural resources  \n\nAspect  General \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nHas the city established a long-term strategic plan for sustainable development?

Its impacts are changing weather \npatterns and rising sea levels. Weather events are becoming \nmore extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are currently at \ntheir highest levels ever. If no action is undertaken the world\u2019s \naverage surface temperature will surpass 3 degrees centigrade \nthis century. Thus countries adopted the Paris Agreement at \nthe COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016 \nand had been ratified by 175 parties as of April 2018. In the \nagreement, all countries take responsibility to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees centigrade. The solution of \nthis challenge are cleaner and more resilient economies, based \non renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce emissions, adapt to climate change and enhance resilience. \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \n70% of energy-related carbon dioxide is generated by cities because of energy production and transportation based on fossil \nfuels, industry, and biomass consumption. Reason enough to \ntake responsibility. Greenhouse gas emissions have to be decreased, and low emission plans have to be developed. As \nstated above, extreme weather events like storms, floods and \nheavy rains are issues cities more and more have to cope with. \nInclusive approaches to achieve climate change mitigation and \nadaptation are thus crucial for all local governments, followed \nby low emission development strategies that include plans for \ncarbon neutral transportation systems, smart grid networks, \nand green growth. Urban planning has to face construction \nand infrastructure that are more resilient to climate change \nrisks. And citizens need to be involved.  \n\nTAKE URGENT \nACTION TO \nCOMBAT           \nCLIMATE \nCHANGE AND  \nITS IMPACTS. \n \n\f\n \n \nSDG 13 \n \n\n170 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 13 l Overview \n \nSDG 13 gathers 42 different indicators for the assessment and monitoring of only two if its five \ntargets.  \n \nThe largest amount of indicators found could be allocated to target 13.1 (strengthen climate \nresilience and adaptation), reflecting mainly aspects such as risk reduction and resilience plans, \nimpact assessments, adaptation and mitigation measures as well as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nTarget 13.3 (education and awareness raising on climate change) is supported well by indicators \nmirroring aspects such as the level of public awareness of the topic, human and institutional \ncapacity, and general monitoring of CO2 emissions.  \n \nTogether, these two targets are at the heart of local climate action. In contrast, the three remaining targets 13.2 (integration into national policies), 13.a (UN commitment) and 13.b (capacity for climate change-related planning in least developed countries) can hardly be handled \nat the city level, which explains the absence of indicators.  \n \nIn summary, SDG 13 is fairly supported by the availability of relevant indicators and does not \nshow significant gaps for the local level. \n \nFigure 13: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 13 \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n13.1  Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to\nclimate-related hazards and natural disasters in all\u2026\n\n13.2  Integrate climate change measures into national\npolicies, strategies and planning\n\n13.3  Improve education, awareness-raising and\nhuman and institutional capacity on climate change\u2026\n\n13.a  Implement the commitment undertaken by\ndeveloped-country parties to the United Nations\u2026\n\n13.b  Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for\neffective climate change-related planning and\u2026\n\nSDG 13 - Climate action\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 13 \n\n \n\n171 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 13 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  13.1  Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related \nhazards and natural disasters in all countries \n\nAspect  Resilience \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nResilience Plans: This involves implementation of risk and vulnerability assessments, financial (capital and operating) plans and technical systems for \ndisaster mitigation addressing natural and human induced disasters and hazards \n\nQualitative (e.g. \nyes/no), including possible additional remarks on any \nresponse provided.

More than 3 billion people depend on the \noceans for their survival, while fisheries directly or indirectly \nemploy over 200 million people. But in the end we all depend \non them: the rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, \ncoastlines, a lot of our food, and also the oxygen in the air we \nbreathe, it\u2019s all influenced by the sea. Unfortunately, the \nworld\u2019s oceans are strongly harmed by human activities, including contamination, loss of habitats and livestock depletion. The same applies for the planet\u2019s rivers and seas.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nTwo-thirds of the sewage from cities is discharged untreated \ninto lakes, rivers and marine water. Many coastal cities still discharge wastewater directly into marine ecosystems. But also \nevery non-coastal city influences life at and below water e.g. \nby micro plastic or air pollution. Local governments can act \npositively by implementing integrated water resources management and programmes to capture, treat and reuse urban \nstormwater runoff. If located at the coast, they can foster their \nintegrated coastal zone management and conservation strategies as well as they can encourage sustainable fishing practices \nthrough ethical municipal procurement. Local governments \nshould adopt regulations against industrial, municipal and agricultural pollution. Also in case of SDG 14 it\u2019s important to involve all citizens to make them aware of their own impact they \nhave and how they can conserve and sustainably use the \noceans, seas and marine resources.  \n\nCONSERVE AND \nSUSTAINABLY \nUSE THE \nOCEANS, SEAS \nAND MARINE \nRESOURCES \nFOR                   \nSUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 14 \n \n\n178 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 14 l Overview  \n \n\nOnly 33 indicators could be allocated to SDG 14, although this goal is highly connected to other \nSDGs, such as SDG 2 (via farming practices that impact on all water bodies), SDG 6 (via the sewage systems that impact on all water bodies), and SDG 13 (because the health of the oceans\u2019 \necosystems contributes more to climate protection than in-land ecosystems do). \n \nYet, this SDG is one of the most neglected ones, both at international, national and local levels. \nThis lack of interest is also reflected in the lack of data availability and thus of existing indicators \nfor the majority of targets: 6 out of 10 targets are not supported by any of the local indicators \nscreened for this study.  \n \nThere is a significant coverage of target 14.1 (reduce marine pollution), with most of the indicators appearing also under SDG 2 and SDG 6. Target 14.2 (restoration and protection of coastal \necosystems) also shows a good range of indicators, focusing on water quality in general and \necosystem services, with target 14.5 (conserve 10 percent of marine areas) being linked directly. \n \nTarget 14.4 (overfishing) shows a low and insufficient coverage of indicators while it could/ \nshould be monitored by coastal cities depending on fish stock for their local economy. Target \n14.b (small-scale artisanal fishers) is affiliated to target 14.4 and has no indicators. Target 14.6 \n(end fisheries subsidies) concerns national policies which explains the absence of urban local \nindicators here.  \n \nTarget 14.3 (ocean acidification) is very broad, explaining the difficulty to allocate indicators, \nalthough it is linked to other targets. None of the indicators made any direct reference to target \n14.c (implementing UNCLOS law). Target 14.a (marine technology and scientific knowledge development) was not reflected in any of the indicators either. \n \nDespite the contributions made by the RUAF and STAR indicator sets, there seem to be clear \nawareness and indicator gaps to fill for this SDG. \n \nFigure 14: Number of indicators identified for targets of SDG 14 \n\n \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce\u2026\n\n14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect\u2026\n\n14.3 Minimize and address the impacts of ocean\u2026\n\n14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and\u2026\n\n14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of\u2026\n\n14.6 By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries\u2026\n\n14.7 By 2030, increase the economic benefits to\u2026\n\n14.a Increase scientific knowledge, develop research\u2026\n\n14.b Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers\u2026\n\n14.c Enhance the conservation and sustainable use\u2026\n\nSDG 14 - Life below water\nNumber of indicators by target \n\f\n \n \n   SDG 14 \n\n \n\n179 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 14 l Indicators \n \n\nTarget  14.1  By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all \nkinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris \nand nutrient pollution (linked to SDG 2 and SDG 6) \n\nAspect  General \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nNumber of incidents of water or farm land pollution and contamination # 27 \n\nJurisdiction or water provider participates in water quality research on \ncontaminants of emerging concern \n\nyes/no 24 \n\nIndustrial/commercial flood-prone % 14 \n\nDoes your city have a prevention plan for litter in the public spaces (and/ \nor marine litter reduction plan)? yes/no 14, 26 \n\n \n\nAspect  Agricultural pollution \n\n \n\n  \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nTotal land surface of protected environmentally sensitive areas as a result of \nfood production and farm conservation practices \n\nha 27 \n\nShare of agricultural land farmed organically / Share of eco-certified agricultural companies in the urban area \n\n% 23, 8 \n\nTotal i) area of agricultural land and ii) number of farms in the city region \n(rural and urban) for different identifiable production systems (eg organic, \nagro-ecological, conventional, intensive livestock, GM etc) \n\nha 27 \n\nNumber of farms reducing livestock density numbers and reporting improved animal health \n\n# 27 \n\nNitrogen surplus per hectare of agricultural land kg/ha 23 \n\f\n \n \nSDG 14 \n \n\n180 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nAspect  Agricultural pollution \u2013 strategy & policy \n\n \n\nAspect  Wastewater pollution \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nPopulation connected to the sewage system % 10, 26 \n\nPopulation connected to waste water treatment systems with at least secondary treatment \n\n% 8 \n\nPopulation connected to tertiary sewage treatment % 18 \n\nPollution levels at the exit of water sanitation facilities (DBO5, DCO, Ptot) m3/a 13, 22 \n\nIf the city is located in an EU Member State, indicate whether the UWWTP \ncomplies with the treatment requirements under the UWWTD \n\nyes/no 13 \n\n \n\nAspect  Wastewater pollution \u2013 strategy & policy \n\nIndicator Unit Source \n\nDoes your city have a wastewater management plan or strategy?

Forests that are habitats for about \n80% of all terrestrial species of animals, homes of the indigenous population and subsistence providers for 1.6 billion people. Harvesting natural resources for industrial production and \nurbanisation is one of the most important causes of biodiversity loss. Land degradation and desertification are burning issues.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nAs cities are growing their demands for mineral, land and biodiversity resources are increasing. Existing urban biodiversity \ncan be preserved by zoning schemes, plans and strategic \nchoices as well as enforcement policies. The protection of life \non land should have a monetary budget within local governments. Further it\u2019s important to build more green spaces, also \nin city centres. They improve the air quality and can be a \nchance to promote active living and learning about nature. Local governments can also act as mediator or initiator of cooperation between public institutions, enterprises as well as citizens to foster actions of biodiversity and wildlife protection.  \n\n  \n\nPROTECT,          \nRESTORE AND \nPROMOTE        \nSUSTAINABLE \nUSE OF             \nTERRESTRIAL \nECOSYSTEMS, \nSUSTAINABLY \nMANAGE         \nFORESTS,         \nCOMBAT         \nDESERTIFICATION, HALT \nAND REVERSE \nLAND                \nDEGRADATION \nAND HALT          \nBIODIVERSITY \nLOSS. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 15 \n\n186  ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 15 l Overview \n \n\nSDG 15 is represented by 64 indicators with a strong focus on target 15.5 (reduce habitat and \nbiodiversity loss). They assess the presence and quality of natural areas in the city, as well as \nthe presence of specific protected natural areas, the abundance of biodiversity and changes in \nthe numbers of species. Indicators on biodiversity action plans and (the existence of) single actions are included as well. \n \nTarget 15.9 (integrate biodiversity in planning) is affiliated to target 15.5 and complements it \nwith indicators on green infrastructure, ecosystem services, heat islands, and biodiversity \nawareness. This target is further affiliated to target 15.a (financial resources for biodiversity and \necosystems). \n \nSince target 15.3 (land degradation) can be considered going beyond desertification and flood \ndamages, indicators on urban sprawl and soil sealing are relevant here. Indicators overlap with \ntarget 11.3 and can be complemented further by referring to this other target. \n \nTargets 15.1 (freshwater ecosystems) and 15.8 (alien species) have a few key indicators that \nhelp embracing the target despite their small number. In contrast, target 15.2 (sustainable forest management) is underrepresented. This can be explained by the fact that this target would \ntypically be addressed in rural rather than urban areas.  \n \nAlso some other targets could not be supported by indicators from the sets considered for this \nreport, for different reasons. This applies for the geographic scope of target 15.4 (mountain \necosystems) for example, or the national level of governance for target 15.7 (trafficking of protected species) and target 15.c (global support to combat poaching). \n \nGenerally, three types of indicators have been found: \n\n\u2022 Indicators of status (e.g. percentage of protected areas) \n\n\u2022 Dynamic indicators which show progress: changes (e.g. increase of protected areas) \n\nand distance to target (e.g. percentage of actions implemented) \n\n\u2022 Binary indicators related to action plans and implementation: Existence or non-exist\nence (yes/no)  \n\nIn summary, the most relevant targets from an urban perspective are covered by a good range \nof indicators.

The bigger a city is the bigger is the mixture of \nethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. It\u2019s on the local governments to take care of every one of them and to make sure that \nno group is excluded. Cities are not only hubs of innovation but \nalso centres of crime. Reducing violence in urban areas has to \nhave high priority.  \n\nPROMOTE \nPEACEFUL AND \nINCLUSIVE        \nSOCIETIES FOR \nSUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT, \nPROVIDE           \nACCESS TO      \nJUSTICE FOR \nALL AND BUILD \nEFFECTIVE,         \nACCOUNTABLE \nAND INCLUSIVE \nINSTITUTIONS \nAT ALL LEVELS.  \n\f\n \n \nSDG 16 \n\n196 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 16 l Overview \n \n\nWith a total of 91 indicators allocated to SDG 16, the distribution among its targets shows an \nuneven coverage. There is a clear focus on target 16.1 (violence and related deaths), mainly \nreferring to aspects such as the general level, amount and perception of violence in the city, but \nalso to specific crimes against women, violence in schools and property infractions. Indicators \non assistance programmes and response capacity against crimes, fires and other emergencies \nto protect the population are included as well. \n \nTarget 16.7 (representative decision-making) is supported by indicators addressing aspects such \nas civil diversity and societal engagement, participatory decision-making, autonomy and election turn-out at the local level, participation rates in EU elections and international agreements. \n \nTarget 16.6 (accountable and transparent institutions) displays indicators for effectiveness, accountability and transparency of the local government, including topics such as financial documentation and e-government. Target 16.3 (rule of law) presents affiliated indicators dealing \nwith the fairness of police services vis-\u00e0-vis citizens, and the fairness of the justice system in \nresponding to complaints. Also, target 16.5 (corruption and bribery) is addressed by only a few \nindicators which however tackle the target directly. \n \nTarget 16.10 (access to information) can be assessed through indicators for open data practices, \nhowever less so for other aspects. In contrast, the remaining targets are hardly represented by \nindicators as they mainly refer to international policy. This is particularly the case for target 16.8 \n(participation of developing countries in global governance), target 16.a (combat terrorism and \nviolence), and target 16.b (non-discriminatory laws in developing countries).  \n \nIn summary, there is a good basis for monitoring SDG 16 at the local level, nonetheless minor \ngaps are present. \n \n\nFigure 16: Number of indicators identified for

It addresses the need for partnerships between governments, the \nprivate sector and civil society. These inclusive partnerships \nare needed at the global, regional, national as well as the local \nlevel. The United Nations see the most import actions in longterm investments, including foreign direct investment, especially in developing countries. These should go to sustainable \nenergy, infrastructure and transport, as well as information \nand communication technologies. The public sector is addressed to set a clear direction and to revise and proof frameworks, regulations and incentive structures that enable such \ninvestments.  \n \nRelevance for cities and local governments \n \nCities and local governments are in an ideal position to support \nand encourage networks like private public partnerships, including also the civil society in the communities. Such municipal cooperation can also attract financial means to implement \ndifferent projects, and can promote better inclusiveness during their implementation. The possibilities of partnerships and \nprojects are numerous and diverse as cities are hubs of education, culture, economic development and infrastructure. Cities \ncan also take an active part by assisting stakeholders with coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring to achieve long-term debt sustainability.  \n\nSTRENGTHEN \nTHE MEANS OF \nIMPLEMENTATION AND         \nREVITALIZE THE \nGLOBAL         \nPARTNERSHIP \nFOR                   \nSUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT. \n\f\n \n \nSDG 17 \n\n208 ETC/ULS Report | 1/2020 \n\nSDG 17 l Overview \n \n\nLast but not least, SDG 17 is represented by 82 indicators dealing with the optimisation of resources, knowledge and tools to reach all the SDGs, in an interdisciplinary and multiscale glance.  \nThere is a predominating coverage of target 17.17 (multistakeholder partnerships), addressing \naspects such as the general type and level of involvement of the society, the diversity of stakeholders, the engagement of the local government with other governments and private entities, \nand the harmonization of visions among departments beyond jurisdictions. Specific indicators \nare provided for the food, energy, water and urban planning sectors.  \n \nMany indicators were found for assessing target 17.8 (access to information and communications technology), target 17.14 (policy coherence for sustainable development), as well as for \ntarget 17.19 (data, monitoring and accountability practices). Other targets see a lower number \nof indicators, which however represent a basis for monitoring them. \n \nTargets 17.5 (investment promotion regimes for least developed countries), 17.9 (international \nsupport), 17.12 (duty-free quota-free market access for least developed countries), 17.13 (macroeconomic stability), 17.15 (country\u2019s policy leadership) are not supported by any of the indicators screened as these targets are too much oriented towards the national level.  \n \nVarious indicator sets contributed to this SDG, among them the EU Green City Tool and the \nReference Framework for Sustainable Cities.

Cities are the engines of Europe\u2019s economy and are increasingly recognised as key players in Europe\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon economy.\nPhoto (c) Rahbek Media on Unsplash\nEurope is a highly urbanised continent. Today, around 75 % of Europe\u2019s population live in urban areas. Estimates predict that European urban population will rise to 80 % in 2050. The urban landscape of Europe is heterogenous and characterised by a diversity of mostly small and medium cities.\n75 %\nof European population live in urban areas, in 2021\n80 %\nof European population live in urban areas, in 2050\nThere are less than 30 cities in the EU with a population of more than one million. According to an assessment by UN-habitat in 2016, of these cities, only Paris and London can be considered megacities \u2013 high density metropolises of more than 10 million inhabitants.\nThe EU has a key role in promoting sustainable urban development. But cities (local authorities in general) have their own governance setting and therefore, are best placed to take local action to tackle and resolve environmental challenges, whilst ensuring a good quality of life for their citizens. Traditionally, they are crucial in improving waste and water management, public transport and efficiently using land by implementing integrated urban planning. Today, they also take centre stage on climate change adaptation and ecosystems preservation and restoration.\nUrban environmental sustainability encourages revitalisation and transition of urban areas and cities to improve liveability, promote innovation and reduce environmental impacts while maximising economic and social co-benefits.\nUrban systems are inherently complex. With the ample support of urban stakeholders, the EEA developed a conceptual model and selected six observation and analysis lenses to assess the role of cities in urban transitions towards environmental sustainability, within the broad European Green Deal framework and the EU Urban Agenda. Based on the stakeholders-led assessment process several outputs have been co-created.\nCity, in which the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems enable them to survive, adapt, and grow in response to chronic stresses and acute shocks.\nCity models based on approaches to functional and ecological urban development design, provide healthy and sustainable environments for both natural systems and communities.\nCity that has achieved or moving towards achieving low-carbon practices in all its aspects including economy, daily life (e.g., travel, politics and culture).\nCity, in which the processes of development include a wide variety of citizens and activities and involving spatial, social and economic inclusion.\nCity with physical and social environments and community resources, which enable people to perform all the functions of life and develop to their maximum potential.\nCity, in which all product and material streams can be brought back into the cycle after use, and become a resource for new products and services.\nThe influence of cities in EU policymaking has been increasingly recognised over the last few decades, including through the establishment of the Committee of the Regions in 1994 and the signing of the Leipzig Charter in 2006 (updated in 2020). The Pact of Amsterdam from 2016 culminated in the Urban Agenda for the EU, giving new impetus to and integrating the already many instruments dedicated to cities. Furthermore, city networks and associations are becoming increasingly important in shaping global climate and sustainability agreements.\nFor references, please go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/sustainability-transitions/urban-environment/urban-sustainability or scan the QR code.\nPDF generated on 30 Jan 2022, 08:18 PM\nFiled under: urban environment\nFiled under: urban environment\nThe EEA is an agency of the European Union\nEngineered by: EEA Web Team\nSoftware updated on 21 January 2022 18:26 from version 21.12.30\nSoftware version: EEA Plone KGS 22.1.20\nCode for developers\nSystems Status\nLegal notice\nCreative commons license\nCMS login\nDocument Actions\nShare with others"]}
